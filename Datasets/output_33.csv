Eurythmics,Heaven,/e/eurythmics/heaven_20051796.html,"Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Won't tear you apart  
  
Yeah,heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's too many cares  
Want to hold you down  
And the world is a window  
Gone underground  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Where the sun don't shine  
And the clock on the wall  
And it counts my time  
  
Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's a song on the air  
With a long pure line  
And a face in the glass  
And it looks like mine  
  
And I'm standing on ice  
When I say that I don't hear planes  
want to scream at walls  
I want to jump my chain  
  
Heaven  
Let me take you up  
Take you higher  
Take you up to the place  
  
Where you're gonna find peace  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart  
You won't have to suffer  
  
You won't suffer  
There's a place in your heart  
Place in your heart  
Where there's peace  
  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart

Eurythmics,Heaven And Earth,/e/eurythmics/heaven+and+earth_20584968.html,"The drunk mortician lurches  
Past the broken windowed churches  
He starts to laugh and cry  
At the same time  
What really makes him drink  
Is the time he has to think  
And he knows that there is  
Nowhere he can hide  
He's got people making speeches  
Hang around like leeches  
To drink that heady drug  
Of untold power  
Their arguments are quoted  
And the winner then is voted but  
The loser always has  
The finest hour...  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you...  
Doctors try to save them  
Priests don't know how to tell them  
There's nothing you can do but repent  
You might think that he's a hero  
But like Nixon Mao or Nero  
All you know is that they came... Then they went  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you

Like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, her legs are long  
When she moves, my brain screams out this song  
  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  
  
Hello, I love you

Eurythmics,Here Comes That Sinking Feeling,/e/eurythmics/here+comes+that+sinking+feeling_20051742.html,"Here Comes That Sinking Feeling  
  
Have you ever heard the sound of disappointment?  
It tangles your head like a winter rose.  
Comes up eager and shining  
And it likes to leave a scar before it goes.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling  
(Can't keep it to myself)  
  
Nobody hurts me like you do.  
You cut into me like a poison dart.  
Creep into my sleep at night.  
Break into my dreams and tear them apart.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling.  
  
Have you ever felt the sound of disappointment?  
It pounds in your head like hammer blows.  
Comes on gentle and smiling.  
And it likes to leave a scar  
Here it comes again no.  
Here comes that sinking feeling.

Eurythmics,Honest,/e/eurythmics/honest_20584964.html,"Now Jerry was no architect  
But she sure knew how to put out all the lights  
I once watched her walk right  
Through a plate glass window  
And never even look hack  
Now here I am talking about all her good points  
I never did think she had any bad  
Though friends told me she could be cruel  
And vicious  
At one time she was the best friend that I had  
And I hope she can hear  
I hope she feels good  
I hope she was the best or everything  
And I hope she feels like a million dollars  
And I hope she knows I was always honest  
Now Jerry was a main-line angel  
She never came home at night  
She slept where the wind would take her  
In her P. V. C thigh length boots  
Make-up black and solid  
Fingernails bitten by teeth so close  
To perfection only marred by  
Seven years of obvious fake prescriptions  
That were one way or making  
Sure that she never saw the daylight  
Before wearing her sunglasses over  
Breakfast with her Italian girlfriend  
In a post blitz kid stupor  
Saying ""How ya doin', Davy boy""  
You know you're such a trooper  
And I hope you feel good  
And I hope you feel like a million dollars  
And I hope you know that I was  
Always.... Honest

Make me all alone.

When you're not here I'm just obsolete.

You're the only one that can make me feel right.  
Try to lay down my sleepin' head

Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere

You know that I might bleed  
Cause if you're trying to cut me down  
I know that you'll succeed  
And if you want to hurt me  
There's nothing left to fear  
Cause if you want to hurt me  
You're doing really well my dear  
Now everyone of us was made to suffer  
Everyone of us was made to weep  
But we've been hurting one another  
And now the pain has cut too deep...  
So take me from the wreckage  
Save me from the blast  
Lift me up and take me back  
Don't let me keep on walking...

Losing myself in my despair

When all I need is you

How I have longed  
For you to come home  
To where you belong  
All of your life  
If you could just see  
All of my joy  
When you are here with me (X2)  
  
Hear me Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh god

Lived in the apartment above me  
We smoked cigarettes on the stairs  
Tell me stories that white boys never hear  
  
Like when he found this shine  
He moved north in nineteen forty-nine  
On his tenth birthday daddy took him to town  
To see the Jackie Robinson play.  
  
It was a picture perfect day  
In the sunshine and the hate  
He didn't understand why all those  
People would say such awful things.  
  
His daddy said pay no attention to them  
Turnaround and watch the man play  
  
The one black man in the baseball field  
Was better in every way  
My daddy said if you wanna win in this world  
You gotta beat 'em the their own game.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Went to law school in nineteen sixty-three  
In the summer between he worked in Alabama  
With Martin Luther King  
  
He met a girl on a summer night  
He fell hard when they saw each other's eyes  
There were people in town that really didn't  
Like that he was black and she was white  
  
They found her in the ditch  
A little outside of town  
Some stupid man was blastin' about it  
So Luther beat him down  
  
He looked him in the eye, spit in his face and  
He turned and walked away.  
He knew he was better than all the hate  
He knew he was bigger than all the pain  
He knew there's a time to fight and a time to walk away  
He knew until he changed the rules  
Ooh yeah they beat 'em at their own game.  
  
He never did lose that feeling inside  
You could hear it in his voice  
You could see it in his eyes  
  
Luther moved out West to live  
When his wife passed away  
He lives right next door to his son  
So he can watch his grandchild play.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Watched election night with me.  
We put a black man in the White House  
A thing he never thought he'd see.  
  
Even though he never cried  
I could see tears in his eyes  
He had dreamed about this moment  
Every single day of his life.  
  
Yeah Luther died that night in his sleep  
But he lived long enough to see,  
America become the kind of place  
He always wanted it to be.  
  
He said you could never forget the day  
That we beat 'em at their own game!  
  
Yeah just like Jackie Robinson (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be bigger than all the hate (just like Jackie Robinson)

Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  
With the charm of Robert Redford  
Oozing out my ears  
But what she sees  
Are my faults and indecisions  
My insecure conditions  
And the tears upon the pillow that I she'd  
She don't care about my big screen  
Or my collection of dvd's  
Things like that just never mattered much to her  
Plus she don't watch to much T. V.

She likes me for me

Or because I am such a hottie

Why does she waste all her time with me  
There must be something there that I don't see  
She likes me for me  
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy

Unlike the Cable Guy

Those wild-eyed boys that had been away  
Haven't changed, haven't much to say  
But man, I still think those cats are great  
  
They were asking if you were around  
How you was, where you could be found  
I told them you were living downtown  
Driving all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
  
You know the chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got  
Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot  
I mean she was steaming  
  
That night over at Johnny's place  
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face  
Man we just fell about the place  
If that chick don't want to know, forget her  
  
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dino's bar and grill  
The drink will flow and blood will spill  
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them  
  
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song  
The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long  
It won't be long till summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town

We stepped off the plane  
Into a warm sunny day  
And then we, got laid  
Together  
  
The sun shines down  
On a Hana lei town  
Where the fish all smile  
Cause they know us  
  
Our wedding day  
Was warm and sunny  
Our friends and family  
Came from out of town  
  
We said I do  
Then ate some food  
And smiled  
Until the sun went down  
  
We'll take the Zodiac Cadillac  
Around the north shore  
Then we'll head back  
The sea turtles come to greet us  
  
So let's get loaded tonight  
We'll drink on the flight  
Back home

Beating hard like a drum inside my head  
Paint the stars in the sky  
That were shining on the night we met  
If we can do this then we can do anything  
Throw the clothes in a pile in the corner on the dirty wood floor  
Open up the big windows and throw a chain on the double locked door  
Open up to the flame  
So strong, it feels so good even though we know that it's wrong  
When we make love I feel complete, like I can do anything  
We can lose ourselves to the far away sound of the noise of the boulevard  
We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars  
The wind sounds just like the ocean  
Blowing big through the trees in my backyard  
I sit alone in a dark room smoking  
And wondering where you are  
You went away when the truth came down  
The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around  
You said that I made you feel weak  
I made you feel like you couldn't do anything  
I try to sing myself to sleep to the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars  
I lay awake with my eyes wide open underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken that should have never been made

I was warm in the shame

easy in the real world  
She will let me be myself  
I know she will let me do anything

park

[Everlast]  
Once upon a time not long ago  
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow  
When laws were stern and justice stood  
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good  
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy  
and this is what he said  
""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash  
robbing' old folks and making' the dash""  
They did the job, money came with ease  
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease  
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother  
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover  
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic  
He said, ""keep still, boy, no need for static""  
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap  
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped  
the kid pulled out a gun  
He said, ""Why'd you hit me?""  
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney  
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure  
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""  
So he cold dashed and ran around the block  
cop radios in to another lady cop  
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister  
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her  
Looked 'round good in expectations  
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations  
But she was coming so he made a left  
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath  
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him  
then he made his move to an abandoned building  
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor  
opened up the door there, guess who he saw  
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope  
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap  
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""  
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun  
He went outside but there was cops all over  
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova  
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university  
Escaped alive though the car was battered  
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered  
Ran out of bullets but still had static  
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic  
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead  
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""  
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong  
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on  
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded  
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded  
he dropped the gun, so went the glory  
And this is the way I got to end this story  
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream  
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream  
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh  
Just another case 'bout the wrong path  
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast  
Good night!

And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind

Had a habit of juvenile delinquency  
If y'all could see all the things I did  
When I was a kid, ya might flip ya lid

My father gave me my very first gun  
When I was the age of two  
I was pullin' out records with the SD Crew

I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me  
And when I was the age of four

Two in the bush is worth one in the hand  
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle  
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle

Poppin' off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle

But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton...  
When I was just a baby my mama told me  
""Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
Now every time I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry...  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car  
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars  
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a movin'  
And that's what tortures me...  
  
Well if they'd free me from this prison

Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

Her fuse is short, her legs are long  
Her temper's mean, her will is strong

A love so true, it's so hard to keep  
Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare

Out the Fordham Road  
Up top in the boogie  
I be loyal to my peeps  
Like budha stud doogie  
  
Never very bad news  
Payin' crazy dues  
I'm blowin' out crews  
And tamin' mad shrews  
  
Like Bill Shakespeare  
The fakes will disappear  
The flavor in your ear  
Is strong like Everclear  
  
Two hundred proofs  
So put the match to the roof  
And set this bitch on fire  
Get rich, the empire's  
  
About to strike back  
If you rock the mic wack  
And that's the way it is 'cause yo  
It's like that

Like three times a lady  
  
When it was pussy for free  
And crack for currency  
It just occurred to me  
It's time for surgery  
  
I remove MC's like tumors  
The lies and the rumors  
Got me thinkin' of this dub  
By Timex Social Club  
  
Yo, word to my momma  
I'm high off the trauma  
Whitey Ford gets deeper than subway trains  
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains  
  
All pain no gain  
Makes the brain insane  
Life in the fast laneT  
He flakes the cash gains (for real)

To get that fly ass ho

To see me rock a live show

To get that last bag of smoke  
'Cause they kindly take from it when that ass was broke  
Hey yo I'm about to g-off  
Just like my name was Ed-o  
  
Black kids call me whitey  
Spanish kids wetto  
White kids call me the king of this be -boy thing  
If it's broke then fix it  
  
If it's wack remix it  
Can't none of you MC's ever fuck with these  
You be crazy on my dick  
Like some porno chick  
  
For the style that I'm blessin'  
Ain't no second guessin'

Reward for submissionA

Won't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate  
I want the stocks and bonds  
Plus the real estate  
  
I want the iron gates  
And low interest rates  
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates  
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe  
  
When times get lean  
Y'all know what I mean

Money money y'all

I want cash and checks  
I want diamond rings  
I want jewels on my neck  
And mad fly things  
  
I want a stack of fat chips  
So I can take long trips  
I want to sail the Bahamas  
On my own cruise ships  
  
I want acres of land  
I want papers in hand  
I want stocks and bonds  
All pros no cons  
  
Hey if it smells funny

I quit my band for love  
I'll smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love  
Make you cry like a dove  
Leave you standin' alone  
In a world so cold  
Watch the drama unfold  
'Cause you sell your soul  
Now you're fearin' your death  
Sniffin' crystal meth 'till there ain't none left  
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it  
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted  
You probably won't admit it  
So you start to sink lower  
You're caught in the flood  
And you're tryin' to find Noah  
If you hungry and your near me yo, you gonna get fed  
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head  
Then come take my bed  
I'll sleep on the floor  
'Cause these are the times that friends are for

And they don't give a damn on the next man  
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health  
I can't wait 'till you the next man  
  
I get uptight for love  
You know I'll fight for love  
I might keep my wifey up all night for love  
And when the daylight comes  
I be seein' mad bums  
With no shoes on their feet  
Plus nothin' to eat  
I can't save the whole street  
So I feel like I'm beat  
And why play the game when nothin' goin' to change  
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans  
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend  
Tryin' to keep my dean  
I try to give to the poor  
Tryin' to get through this life  
And get through that door  
I'm all up in this mix  
For these final tics  
Goin' all the way to seven  
And it's half past six  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
I pray to God for love  
I'll make Jihad for love  
And I just might pull your freakin' card for love  
Make you sing 'Hey Love' like my man King Son  
I freak the art noise  
Over all you toys  
Better bring your boys  
Summon all your crew  
No matter what you do  
It's comin' back on you  
Just like a planet orbits  
Let your sponge absorb it  
It's logical conclusion  
It's b-boy fusion  
And confusion say that he want control  
Of your mentality  
Your body and your soul  
So if you lose your whole  
Come and take my hand  
And link up this jam  
'Cause money that's the plan  
Tryin' to get through this maze  
Not to win this race  
We either ridin' on our horse  
Or walkin' on our face  
So come take your place on the side of love  
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love

Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda  
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her  
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder

I knew a man with a son  
He bought him a gun  
And learned Shorty just how to use it  
Taught him huntin' and skinnin'  
Right from the beginnin'  
Built himself a mighty fine killa  
Killa  
But Shorty got picked on  
Beat on and kicked on  
Now all his classmates want to punk him  
So the tears in his eye may catch him in the rye  
Told his old man he went huntin'  
Never felt so free  
Like his destiny  
Their was someone out on the horizon  
His heart went cold, he felt a hundred years old  
Started pullin' back on the trigga

Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
I've been breakin my neck just to live correct  
Keep my head above water, living check to check  
I get no respect, I got no regard  
Patience is a struggle when times is hard  
Paper's in the shortage, tryin to pay the mortgage  
I can't get to work, they repossess my car  
Bout to buy a pistol and kidnap Bristol  
Tell me bitch, can you see me from your backyard?  
This New World session of the Great Depression  
I'm living off preemptive unchecked aggression  
You're cryin and you're bitchin, know it every politician:  
My family tradition is heavy ammunition  
I cock the hammer, I'ma rock the vote  
Got your forhead on lock, dead in my scope  
Look me in the eye, what you're lying for  
What you're living by, what you dyin for

Just want to do what's right, but I don't know if I ever will  
There's so many reasons, too many excuses  
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses  
I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary  
This kind of lonely is making me weary  
I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine  
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine  
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say  
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway  
Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty  
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call  
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all  
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure  
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before  
And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying  
This kind of lonely is worse than dying  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die

Everlast,What Is This,/e/everlast/what+is+this_20341418.html,"(What is it?)  
(This is everlasting)  
Step up while I inject  
An overdose of intellect  
An overload of my vibrations  
Better yet a new sensation  
I was lost but then he found me  
Though corruption did surround me  
I was taken to a higher  
Level of earth and fire  
Where the souls of men would burn  
They were taught but did not learn  
About the righteous laws of God  
We're all just seeds among the sod  
Take any roots and tryin to grow  
Though the process may seem slow  
Please take heed to my suggestion  
Learn the answer to the question  
What is this  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
(Heavens to Mergatroid)  
(What is it?)  
Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura  
I'm speaking on my soul, for to burn would be true horror  
There's no such thing as luck, your life is in the hands of God  
So do not treat his righteous laws with blatant disregard  
In order to follow the Lord's path, here's all you must do  
Do unto each of your brothers as you'd have them do you  
This golden rule is all you need, and you will be rewarded  
The man that don't, will pay the price and believe me, you can't afford it  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
This is for the ones who war over whose God is the right one  
Can it be the Asian one, the black one or the white one?  
The answer to the question really isn't controversial  
There is only one God and his love is universal  
If you sin and crave redemption, all you need to do is ask him  
Then you will be fully prepared for a life that's everlasting  
So take heed to the words I say, grab a good book and get hip to  
The teachings of the holy Q'uran or the Bible's holy scripture  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?

Three sides to every story

Nor more companionship,  
You can handle it,  
Just abandon it,  
Leave it behind,  
And look for the brighter day  
Give it some time,  
Cause it won't come right away

Hold on to your dignity  
Don't sit around,

Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl  
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle  
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through  
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you  
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs  
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's  
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile  
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial  
Who started going on about how he moving on  
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about

They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off

If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper

Fabolous,Change You Or Change Me,/f/fabolous/change+you+or+change+me_20052279.html,"You know what?  
Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse  
But umm, some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?  
  
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole  
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold  
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls  
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?  
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride, I ain't that old  
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??  
It probably don't seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle  
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you  
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you  
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you  
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you  
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?  
  
[Chorus:]  
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you  
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you  
If you got love for me, I still got love for you  
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you  
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you  
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you  
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you  
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth  
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth  
I'm speakin' the known truth  
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof  
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?  
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?  
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right  
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites  
I ain't blind from the limelite,  
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right  
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful  
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed  
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler  
One million customers, and I still bust at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?  
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few ?? and met a few locs  
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes  
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz  
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds?  
It's strange, what the fame'll do  
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the same nigga man  
Same nigga, that ridin' with you  
Niggas that's fuckin' with you  
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas  
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like  
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy

And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing  
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something  
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing  
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing  
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing  
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens  
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams (swish)  
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones  
I feel like n-ggas done found one of my old phones  
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans  
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes  
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe

On the courthouse steps after they throw it out  
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out  
Doors don't open they self the chauffeur get out  
My exhale made anything a foggy blur  
I make my way through the reporters and photographers  
I take my lady's hand I shake my attorney's  
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey  
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out  
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud  
Any last words?  
Justice has been served  
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I ain't lose a step  
I ain't miss a beat  
Thugs have emotions we miss the streets  
We kiss the heat  
We love the block  
We rubber band the money we black glove the glock  
I'm screamin' free at last free at last  
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass  
That's real talk that's a real bitch  
Fly as I left the minx still fit  
They know my name but in case they didn't know so  
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso  
So you should have your shit packed  
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Aye daddy's home after a long day  
I'm from the hood I came a long way  
But I ain't goin' back I'm just visitin'  
I hear the streets talkin' I'm just listenin'  
If they ain't talkin' money I'm out my business then  
If that ain't what it is then what is it then?  
I'm out here grizzyin' swizzyin'  
It's me bitches sittin' in a phantom  
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom  
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson  
I came back for it like I left it nigga  
You try me you get more than a efa f it nigga  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)

Holding my bottles up

We all got rooms nobody crash the couch  
More K's at the crib than a Kardashian house  
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links  
A lot of ice in 'em I'm talking large drinks  
Lets see what the Audemar thinks  
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink  
There are no challengers F what the Dodge think  
I'm riding in the... my garage stinks

Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though  
Got your baby momma eating off a lead plates

Plenty fish in the sea and I keep bait  
You're a broke rollerblader, cheapskate!  
My jeep plate say ""Tune in to the game""

Listen up son, I'm immune to all the lame  
If I fathered your style, put a Jr. to your name  
I searched the whole planet, there's no comp on Earth

Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass now lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk sh-t like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Won't be on Craigslist, lifestyle A-list  
On my way to Vegas I part playlist  
Yeah it's just another page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me  
My only job, consistent and persistent  
I go so hard my assistants need assistance

'Fore my man's n 'em black out, Meth Red!

The only suspect they have is young funeral  
And when you see him  
He might be on his goony proud  
So you put him up in the air George Clooney style  
Slow motion for me so just slim juvenile  
Don't sh-t move a dude can't move his bowels  
Catch it like Larry Fitzgerald  
Kurt Warner bullets coming out the 5ths bureau  
Baby I'mma make it, my sh-ts thorough  
You shootin blanks your sh-ts durrough  
The competi... can't hold hold me  
But first lay in a box and cross your hands for me  
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me  
I triple what you see's like I'm Ross' man homie (Triple C)

You pick the place everybody cross the land for me  
Keep it real, I can't endorse or stand phoney's  
'Less we arm wrestle don't force my hand homie  
These YSL's cost a grand only  
My white girl bought that Porsche Cayenne for me  
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches  
School of heart, I get brain from gorgeous teachers  
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either  
Any competition he see the boy just ethers

Here's another one  
  
[Fabolous]  
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself  
Won't nobody do as much as myself  
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself  
For a pretty girl as such as yaself  
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself  
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself  
But I, make the time when I have to  
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women  
There's some who be willing and skimming  
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in  
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens  
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now  
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous  
Others pass diseases that you can catch now  
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world  
And.. I don't want to live in it alone  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: Lil Mo]  
Ill give you all my love  
And you can always trust  
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)  
Ill never leave (no, no, no)  
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me  
So holla at somebody real (cause i)  
'cause I'm so real  
  
[Fabolous]  
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92  
but I pray I will find you  
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you  
The fake may try to blind you  
That's why I stay fly like I do  
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to  
First I need a girl that may die as my boo  
Then I may try the I do's  
But, I refuse to be trick  
Or used by a chick  
Who gets amusement of kicks  
Out of abusing my dick  
When its real I'm all in it  
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it  
(no) before it didn't matter who  
Now I look for some with a little attitude  
I could chitter chatter to, good looking  
But witty and compatible  
Long hair wit a fatty too  
And that'll do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lil Mo]  
No I'm not trying to pressure you  
But my loves to incredible  
For to waste  
In front of your face  
Then I give you something you can feel  
To let you know your hollering at somebody real  
  
[Fabolous]  
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you  
The feelings that I feel could that be true  
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo  
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away  
That's til somebody real sways my way  
Then I might spend some days always  
On a Asia bay  
Eating food made the Cajun way  
And sippin ga lil saki  
Blowing a lil brocoli  
But this world is full of fluzi's  
And bullshit usually  
I pull I'm choosy  
And on this joint and at this point  
I know I need to holla at somebody real  
For real

Nice, you niggas must of heard me wrong.  
I blame them horses when I turn that Porsche turby on (vrrm)  
My engine gettin' his Kentucky derby on,  
Seats is brunette paint is dirty blond  
Speaking of dirty blond's  
Say hi to curvy Don Fergie John  
With the body movement of a turbion  
I just watch her,  
It's been a hectic year  
So I sit and get fried  
Call the weed electric chair  
But y'all on death row, one request left  
You looking for ya girl oh she just left  
Her and my dick just became B.F.F's  
Then I threw her out like jazzy J. E.F.F  
I'm raw dawg, y'all safe sex  
You dicks belong in latex not tape decks  
You can't see me  
Neither can the flunkies under you  
My shit bananas, like a monkey number two  
I'm bigger than that  
More like guerrilla though  
Nick name funeral got that from this killer flow.  
Er'thing still a go, my pockets be extra fat  
Big money on deck like A Rods next to bat  
Shit  
Somebody contact the tabloids  
I'm a big deal like a contract from bad boy  
Yeah, it's all good baby baby  
My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy  
We hit the club like Nino in the C.M.B  
Pretty mixed bitch I just call ha P.M.B  
Watch ya step baby gettin' out that G.M.C  
You bust yo ass girl we both gon' be on T.M.Z  
Don't be shy let them cameras expose you  
The worst that can happen is I Amber Rose you  
People running up like damn I knows you  
Hey ain't you? Yeah I am that bitch  
Six feet deep nigga, yeah I am that ditch.  
Throw it in the bag in a recession, I am that rich  
I'm under close watch niggas got binoculars  
I ain't what's poppin' bitch I'm what's popular  
If I'm the one to go at, niggas what's stopping ya  
I call my gun Nadia, and I be finger poppin' her  
Keep that bitch cummin' like blaka blaka  
Go to ya head like a shot a vodka

When you grow up in my hood  
Help don't show up in my hood  
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood  
Young kids get clapped in my hood  
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I'm always close to..  
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er  
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)  
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'  
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist  
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town  
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)  
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets  
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats  
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat  
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street  
But that's the way we was raised  
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean  
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18  
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice  
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice  
Them mothers are getting younger today  
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way  
We don't have role models  
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)  
Ain't no diplomas or degrees  
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)  
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience  
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle  
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you  
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong  
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: Fab]  
We try to make the most of what we got  
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)  
Any nigga that boast be getting got  
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got  
And young niggaz be like they slow  
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro  
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid  
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS  
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET  
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED  
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag  
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'  
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads  
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds  
They telling me to vote..and I would  
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.

Dominican girl who knows more than mongul  
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz  
It sounds like a plan  
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs  
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can  
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk  
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk  
A little accent, cute ass lisp  
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss  
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault  
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk  
We can wake up 'round noon on a saturday  
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee  
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call  
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it  
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it

Your co-workers thinkin' you got a crush on the clerk  
You always talk about yo boss, about how much of a jerk he is  
But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?  
'Cause that's how such and such get hurt  
And lame ass n-ggas start bringin' crutches to work  
I know you got it girl, I trust in your work  
Ladies is pimps too, go 'head brush off the dirt  
I be here when you get off with dutches and purp  
I want you after dinner, your such a dessert  
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique  
And in most cases with you  
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep  
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee  
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'  
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions

But if you try me nigga,  
I will be your caller I-D.  
And that means I got your number.  
Please don't make me dial it,

Catch me on a tidy night,  
Might be Gucci'd down to the tidy whites.  
OK it's loso,

My son is the heir to the thrown,

So daddy need money,  
Mummy need new truies.  
Baby needs new shoes,

You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life  
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice  
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice  
And when you slap this ass, it shake like jello, right?  
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight  
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice  
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair  
And she know they talking but she never gon' care  
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear  
I can't imagine what a fall upon lebron's ear  
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line  
Niggas buy her watches just for making time  
Fake say ""give it up"" never had to ask  
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask  
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?  
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?  
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames  
The same dudes will see her and give they last name  
Funny how I became the apple of her eye  
The game went south and I'm a rapper from ny  
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love ""trap or die""  
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy  
And fell in love with a 2009 verse  
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first  
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck  
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts  
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut  
You know me? I can spot a swan from a duck  
My approach? Smoother than an armani tux  
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck  
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup  
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck  
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed  
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange  
Asked ""can we meet again?"" she said ""that can be arranged""  
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged  
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained  
But for now she hopped into a platinum-colored range

Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach  
And I never show my hand, not even to me  
See...  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 2]  
Say what's on your heart if you're real  
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal  
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought  
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught  
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot  
You empty clip niggas aint got a shot  
  
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore  
Now you decide if their to die for  
Advice to my haters, do what I say now  
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down  
Thought it was love, how foolish of us  
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]  
Look, as the crooked World revolves  
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)  
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live  
And when death comes you better have lives to give  
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs  
And rats die ugly, die with kids  
These niggas is snitching and still living  
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches  
Niggas pretend like they actually in  
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them  
That blood look familiar when it's leaking  
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga  
That aint love  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 4]  
Life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous  
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist  
Just anothger page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me

These bitches talk shit out the same mouth they kiss you  
These niggas kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you  
Eww, you niggas disgust me  
And they ain't talkin bout shit unless they discuss me  
Let's talk about how, I'm killin errything I touches  
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches  
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre  
No Cash Money from Baby and no rocs from Jay  
And I'm still here  
We still here  
What does this break dude?... It's still here  
And dude talk, concernin New York  
When I was runnin the city you was learnin to walk  
So I watched you niggas take they first steps  
And I was happy for ya, daddy was clappin for ya  
But, wasn't for me prolly wouldnt've happened for ya  
So I rest my case  
I'm a rappin lawyer  
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches  
Section full of bridezillas, that's mad bitches  
No words, I describe em with letters best  
They pretty as can be, curvy as the letter ""S""  
They keep it G, they sweet as T  
Look good in the passenger seat of V  
They ride double are, smell like double C  
The Bags are L. V., D, or a double G  
Fly as hell, shades wire cell  
On E, sippin P. J., high as hell  
And please don't even talk about swag  
I'm cool and collective  
A Fool with perspective  
I'm far from being typical my respect is reciprocal  
I already came up  
You still on the zipper pull  
And I would say my style is 5th Fab meets Brooklyn  
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin  
They watch what I do, so they know what to do  
Lil money never told big money what to do  
Money talks, if you speak guapanese  
A language better known if you gettin cheddar holmes  
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone  
And that way you can holla bout a dolla  
I hear em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler  
Come holla at yo gualla, don't holla at sovallas  
You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas  
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala  
We can get it jumpin like the drolics on Impala  
I feel like Neno lettin em rock wallas off the colla  
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?  
Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin  
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?  
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not lookey  
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo  
Cuz who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?  
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him  
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him  
No Carlito's way  
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potatoe  
Youahead, got me later

Under a pair of knowing eyes

The chasm of misery

Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German.  
This is the story of a lonely man  
Who's seen the world  
From japan to Afghanistan  
Hey! ho!  
  
Everybody thought that I was gone for good  
But I'm back, understood  
Hey! ho!  
  
I've been through the snow and the storm  
Felt the cold  
No one to keep me warm  
Agony and pain  
  
Falco rides again, bang bang  
I won't break  
I won't bend  
Falco rides again  
It's me and my gang  
I came back just like a boomerang  
I'll fight 'till the end  
Falco rides again  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been pushed around  
Beated, mistreated,  
Gagged and bound  
Hey! ho!  
  
Not a soul in the world thought I would survive  
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive  
Hey! ho!  
I'll break down the walls  
No more defeat  
I want the taste of victory  
Revenge is sweet  
  
Rides again!

Where can you learn to fly, play in sports or skindive, study oceanography?  
Sign up for the big band or sit in the grandstand when your team and others

In the navy, you can sail the seven seas  
In the navy, you can put your mind at ease  
In the navy, come on now people, make a stand  
In the navy, can't you see we need a hand?  
In the navy, come protect the mother land  
In the navy, come on and join your fellow man  
In the navy, come on people make a stand  
Inthe navy, in the navy

If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter, the recruiting office fast  
Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait, they're signing up new seamen
fast  
Maybe you are too young to sign up today, but don't you worry 'bout a thing  
For I'm sure there will always be a good navy, protecting the land and sea

So went to San Francisco, somewhere far out the space  
In the eighties: I don't know, some did it for the money,  
Some did it for the showthere's no time  
No time to remember these days  
No time to hold back in that size  
We don't have no time, no time, no time...  
No time for revolution (4 times)In the nineties: there's a soul called those

About politicians, no embitions - tell me what's the vision

Our hands were just that close,  
The sweetness never lasted, no.

And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb  
He says ""I've seen bigger""  
She says ""I've lit better""  
And they throw the matches down into the glitter  
Not a dry eye left in the house  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
  
We're all fighting growing old  
We're all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St. Peter's list  
But you need to lower your standards  
'Cause it's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this

With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence

It is a present,

To love it you just might like it,  
You can't live without it,  
There's a million open windows,  
Passing these opened windows,

It gets so easy to narrow these eyes,  
But these eyes will stay wide,  
I will stay young,  
Young and dumb inside,

To forget my lines,  
You're not punk and I'm telling everyone

You could save us all,  
Go on living, prove us wrong,  
Your leap of faith,  
Could be a well-timed smile,  
Survival never goes out of style  
  
I have a message: save your generation,  
We're killing each other by sleeping in,  
Finnegan, begin again,  
This one can be won,  
One can become two,  
Two can pick and choose,  
You could be the first

Go on living, prove us wrong,

You have to learn to learn from your mistakes,  
You can afford to lose a little face,  
The things you break,  
Some can't be replaced,  
A simple rule: every day be sure you wake  
  
[Chorus:]  
You could save yourself,  
You could save us all,  
Go on living, prove us wrong,  
Your leap of faith,  
Could be a well-timed smile,

Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
'Cause you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

It's been months

Cryin over you

So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
I'm turning off the radio

Delivering just what you need

To make your heart swell and burst

Ashamed of the way

And another around to help us bend your trust

The only thing I haven't done yet is die  
And it's me and my plus-one at the afterlife  
Crowds are won and lost and won again

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime  
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead  
Dance, this is the way they'd love  
If they knew how misery loved me  
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories  
Even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
Growing up, growing up  
  
I got troubled thoughts  
And the self-esteem to match  
What a catch, what a catch

Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair  
What's this?  
  
What's this? What's this?  
There's something very wrong  
What's this?  
There's people singing songs  
  
What's this?  
The streets are lined with  
Little creatures laughing  
Everybody seems so happy  
Have I possibly gone daffy?  
What is this?  
What's this?  
  
There's children throwing snowballs  
Instead of throwing heads  
They're busy building toys  
And absolutely no one's dead  
  
There's frost on every window  
Oh, I can't believe my eyes  
And in my bones I feel the warmth  
That's coming from inside  
  
Oh, look  
What's this?  
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss  
Why that looks so unique, inspired  
They're gathering around to hear a story  
Roasting chestnuts on a fire  
What's this?  
What's this?  
  
In here they've got a little tree, how queer  
And who would ever think  
And why?  
  
They're covering it with tiny little things  
They've got electric lights on strings  
And there's a smile on everyone  
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong  
This looks like fun  
This looks like fun  
Oh, could it be I got my wish?  
What's this?  
  
Oh my, what now?  
The children are asleep  
But look, there's nothing underneath  
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them  
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things  
Secure them in their dreamland  
What's this?  
  
The monsters are all missing  
And the nightmares can't be found  
And in their place there seems to be  
Good feeling all around  
  
Instead of screams, I swear  
I can hear music in the air  
The smell of cakes and pies  
Are absolutely everywhere  
  
The sights, the sounds  
They're everywhere and all around  
I've never felt this good before  
This empty place inside of me has been filling up  
I simply cannot get enough  
  
I want it, oh, I want it  
Oh, I want it for my own  
I've got to know  
I've got to know  
What is this place that I have found?  
What is this?

Fastball,Funny How It Fades Away,/f/fastball/funny+how+it+fades+away_20053185.html,"Those days when our hearts were as big as the sun  
Turn around with a smile for everyone  
That feeling's a memory  
Funny how it fades away  
You won't see those pale grays returning to blues  
The colors will wash out as I shrink in my shoes  
And I won't always live and breathe  
Watch me as I fade away  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away  
  
Who on this planet would ever refuse  
The chance of a lifetime to love and lose  
When time is of no importance  
Have you seen it slip away?  
  
We wake in the morning and work all day  
We dress up in the evening with nothing to say  
Just like a candle burning bright  
Burning like forever then it fades away

Decorated in a candy glaze  
Each pretty ink blot panel  
Tells a different tale  
Each photo on the mantel  
Sweet memories that never will go stale

Living with a memory that might have been  
So pick me up on a weekday night  
We'll get together and ride around in  
The black and white

My silly clothes and my silly ways  
Each drunken drugstore purchase  
Each chemical advance  
Seven days a weekend  
Everday the same old dizzy dance

I was moving forward  
From the point I've come from

This is our song now  
  
Gotta see it  
Nothing means I gotta gotta  
Feel it  
Everything is out I gotta  
Hold out  
Everything is out I gotta  
Day out  
Just invite them  
Gotta  
Bore them  
Till I take us out  
I gotta feel like  
Every single line  
I gotta  
Clean it out to the side  
When we're not down and out  
  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
  
Burning down the city  
Warning out of something  
But I need to find it  
'Cause I got no sun down  
  
Dug a whole was so fun  
And a taste that's floating  
What it doesn't meet no  
Place to silent sleep now  
  
I gotta feeling  
Doesn't mean I sad because I  
Love me  
Everything around it isn't  
Better  
If you sing it loud and I  
Jam myself to dawn  
I got  
So much dissing at the side and  
When its  
Just another ride and you  
Sow yourself to the cat  
Bet it

we carry our walls around in our pockets,  
Electricity crackles and bricks turn to dust,

I get a rush,  
straight to my head,  
I get a rush.  
I get a rush,  
down to my feet,  
I get a rush.  
  
See you there, standing with a secret smile on your face.  
I am looking at my salvation.  
Heal the broken hearts,  
feed the nation with love...  
  
A rush of wind...of blood through my veins and energy,  
you are here with me now and I love it.  
Take me away...  
Fly with me

Fatboy Slim,Song For Shelter,/f/fatboy+slim/song+for+shelter_20053298.html,"I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, ha.  
Into this thing.  
  
The deeper I go,  
The more knowledge I know.  
What to sing, what to bring. What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, deeper, deeper  
Into the vibe,  
What? ha.  
  
Chilling in the corner,  
At the shelter all by myself,  
Checkin' it out, Im not dancing no more,  
But, why? Why? Why? What?  
  
How on Earth?  
Are you supposed to vibe? around the fake ones, the one that say:  
They know what is what,  
But they don't know what is what,  
They just strut.  
What the fuck? What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper,  
Into this thing,  
And I pretend,  
That they're not there.  
I just stare,  
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song, Spinning it strong  
Playing things like:  
We care bout house, we care.  
  
That's my shit, what?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper  
When people start to disappear,  
It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,  
Take off my sweater and my pants,  
And i start to dance,  
And all the sweat just goes down my bass?.  
  
And I pretend that,  
There's nobody there but me in this place.  
  
I get deep yo, I get deep. What? Woo!  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs,
and it's like: Oh shit! I get deep...  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get
drunk, and I'm over the place.  
But I catch myself right on time, right on line with the beat, and it's so
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. I get deep, I get deep, I get deep.  
  
Why, if house music was air, then Dr. Love would be my song, and I would only
take deep breaths.  
And fill my lungs with the rhythm, with the bass. I get deep, I get deep.  
  
??????  
  
She said i wanna go out on a picknick with you baby, Under the big bright
yellow sun  
  
You guys, just keep it rollin'

This lady, with islands to defend.  
My baby, she rules our house with force,  
She plagues me, I wish I could divorce.  
  
Playing football with my feelings,  
Making mince-meat of my friends.  
Divorce is far too good for you,  
It's death that us must part, Honey,  
Oh for these ten long years to end.  
  
My baby, I never tried to wed,  
Someone held a shotgun to my head.  
And lately I've little cause to smile,  
Ever since she goose-stepped down the aisle.  
  
My baby, she walked out in the end,  
Basically she'd shafted all her friends.  
But major peace without her won't be found,  
Till my sweetheart's rotting underground

Fatboy Slim,That Old Pair Of Jeans,/f/fatboy+slim/that+old+pair+of+jeans_20582915.html,"Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
All you used to do was put me down  
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground  
And all you used to do was criticize me  
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see  
  
You would always get so sensitive  
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  
But now I'm certain of the way I live  
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game  
  
And it's such a shame  
That you try to make pain  
Another word for my name  
Whether giving or receiving  
It's one the same  
Just one more link  
In your long-ass chain  
But it's time to break  
This frame and my strengthful will  
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built  
Gave my heart  
But my self-respection you won't steal  
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
So I asked my mama for her two cents  
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend  
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again  
Came two little consensus from all them opinions  
That life is too short to be unhappy  
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt  
Knowing what I deserve is gold  
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal  
  
Maybe I was just too strong to let go  
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show  
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""  
But whatever the case I can't take it no more  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up  
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on  
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up  
And start again like when we started this up  
Back when everything was fresh  
And every moment a blessing  
I'd laugh at all of your jokes  
You'd listen to my suggestions  
One mind, one soul,  
With common decimation  
Now we can't help but fight over the direction

All my life and it all changed in one day  
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on  
  
The hood never caused but they all was hard  
His kind never represented love at all  
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars  
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage  
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start  
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god  
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top  
Access granted with this empty can of starch  
No not the Bentley liquor store got robbed  
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block  
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars  
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage  
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large

Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow

Yeah it could of been tragic for the boy from the scums  
Yeah he got the craft-matic no rest till I won  
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone  
Born near the savages kinda made me numb  
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung  
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs  
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum  
Cause  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Sitting here, reminiscing,  
Of all the nights I had to grind  
Taking chances with the system,  
I put my whole life on the line  
All my life know it ain't been sweet  
All my life I been in the streets  
All my life up against concrete  
All my life mama gave me the speech  
All my life somebody died every week  
All my life ducking the police  
All my life without soda I weeped  
All my life no first class seats

Feelings must be  
Cause beat is what they want  
They are screaming I got you

Look at me now but all before hey Mr. skid row  
The dirty south ain't just a name the way I've been poor  
The projects burnin' white, I call it gizmo  
Went from a gun to them cars in a jigga video  
Can't find a meal to a mil, only god know it  
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it  
Can I live to I'm livin' like my momma told it  
Before you rip it, gotta sew it  
Yeah  
  
I'm talking' bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots  
  
Hey, still on my coupe but can't take  
Somebody had to be just to get away  
My sister had to leave, I respect her stayin' safe  
Oh yea I had to grieve but I'm stronger to this day  
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant  
I'm mistakin' for courage, which victory so gorgeous  
Make it through two bush, I can make it through any forest  
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important  
37 Ave and 187 Street, Miami (karat city), now I'm part of a legacy  
I'm thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy  
There's only five letters really help me  
  
I'm talking' bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots  
  
Hey I know the seeds been planted  
It's damaging my soul but my dreams been granted  
That triple life towards, much deeper than nurse planet  
What could I want more than redoing I never planned it  
Gets no lower than a grabbin' on your feet  
A man will stand for nothin' if he fall off with the feet  
A baller and a hitter all in the street  
If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease  
Roots before the branches, roots before mansions  
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson  
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas  
Roots whether you black, white, or spanish  
  
I'm talking bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pray you're just getting by  
  
Hey wait I thought you made it  
How'd your bottled crown fall off  
Tell me how'd you get so tired  
Fade it down to the wire  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
So very ordinary  
Wait until my bomb goes off  
See the actors run and hide  
Fake it all in stride  
  
One day we all can say where we're gone  
And haunt the ground we're from  
Everything's so open wide  
Hear within the divide  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
Ain't it the life  
Ain't it the life  
Ain't it the life

Just sail on by  
Sail on by  
Ain't it the life

Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's  
Been mine, all mine  
  
Ain't no way, DOA

It's a shame we have to disappear  
No ones getting out of here, alive

Open the streets and raise the gates

The sacrifice, the knowing to survive  
The first decline, another state of mind

A game you were winning  
Wouldn't go your way

And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons ev'rywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and snow on ev'ryone  
So many things I would have done  
But clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way you feel  
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave 'em laughing when you go  
And if you care, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take, and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
To say ""I love you"" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
I've looked at life that way  
  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads, they say I've changed  
Well something's lost, but something's gained  
In living ev'ry day  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From up and dawn, and still somehow

By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping.

adventures trying to find somebody to replace him. Non only for the bass parts
in the music, but to play the role that he was supposed to play in the film,
which is a pretty large part. And, uh, our first candidate for the role was
Wilfrid Brambell, who played the grandfather in A Hard Day's Night. So Wilfrid
came over, tried out for the part, everything was set, he rehearsed with us
for about a week, and then one day came to the studio here and, completely
freaked out, and said that he couldn't handle it anymore. So, we went into the
dressing room and sat around with the guys in the band and tried to figure out
what we're gonna do 'bout replacing the replacement, and the first person that
walked through the door was Martin Lickert, who happened to be Ringo's driver,
and, uh, everybody just turned and look at him and we went, ""You!""

Frank Zappa,Be-bop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen's Church),/f/frank+zappa/be+bop+tango+of+the+old+jazzmens+church_20955832.html,"Fz: Some of you may know that the tango, which is not a very popular dance
anymore, was at one time reputed to be a dance of unbridled passion, back in
the old days when it wasn't so easy to get your rocks off, when it was hard to
make contact with a member of the. .. Opposite camp, and you had to resort to
things like dancing close together and going hey. .. Those were the days.
Well, those days are probably gone forever, I don't know, unless Nixon is
going to bring them back a little bit later, but, we have this very special
highly evolved permutated tango. It's actually a perverted tango. By the time.
.. Yes, it's so perverted! This is the ""Be-Bop Tango,"" a special entertainment
event that includes choreography a little bit later, so watch out, folks. ..
You can turn on the big lights, we may need 'em. You know, the ones in the
audience. Heh heh heh. Okay, you're ready? Not too fast now 'cause I wanna get
the right notes on the tape 'n this, this has to be the one. This has to be
the one with all the right notes on it. Okay, 're you ready? 'n this is a hard
one to play. .. One, two, three, four. ..  
  
Fz: The cowbell as a symbol of unbridled passion, ladies and gentlemen.  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, Bruce Fowler has just completed some sort
of trombone solo, based on the, uh, idea of an evolved tango-event. Bruce has
also prepared for you a demonstration of a dance that he hopes will sweep the
ocean, right after the Mud Shark did. Bruce is now warming up the important
muscles of the body, in preparation. .. In preparation for the Real Live Be-
Bop Tango which we're gonna demonstrate. Napoleon will assist him.  
Napoleon: Wait a minute now. ..  
Fz: Napoleon, just put your horn down, just relax, put your head back, here
comes the drill. Okay, ha ha ha, you know what I'm talkin' about? Okay. ..
This is sort of like jazz in it's own peculiar way. .. Jazz is not dead, it
just smells funny. .. Okay, let's go!  
George: Yeah, man, jazz, man, you know what I mean?  
  
This is Be-Bop,  
Even though you think it doesn't sound like that  
  
(Be-Bop. .. ! That's no Be-Bop!)  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, some of you with a musical education can
tell that the notes that George just sang when he went: ""This is Be-Bop, even
though you think it doesn't sound like that,"" it's actually a sort of a
twisted form of the theme of the tango itself which will get de. .. Even more
depraved as the number goes on. George will now attempt to dismember that
melody, play it and sing it at the same time while. ..  
  
Pe-dop!  
  
Fz: Hey, that's the way. .. While we sort of dance to it, okay? Try it,
George. ..

Tee-do-do-Teep

Do-do-dee-doo  
Do-dee-Dah. ..  
Oh, yeaaaah!  
  
George: As I was saying. ..  
Fz: Now, what we'd like to do at this point is get some volunteers from the
audience to. .. I know you will, oh God, you will. .. We need some. .. Heh heh
heh. .. Now, as a matter of fact you did, didn't you. .. No, we wanna have
some people who've never tried it before, who've never even thought of trying
it before. A boy, a girl, preferably who like each other, who would like to
come up here and attempt to dance to what George sings. ..

And he said I'm outta sight!  
He said for a nominal service charge  
I could reach nirvana tonight  
If I was ready, willing and able  
To pay him his regular fee  
He would drop all the rest of  
His pressing affairs and devote  
His attention to me  
  
But I said look here brother  
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me  
  
The mystery man got nervous  
And he fidget around a bit  
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe  
And he whipped out a shaving kit  
Now I thought it was a razor  
And a can of foaming goo  
But he told me right then when the top popped open  
There was nothin' his box won't do  
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo  
He said you might not believe this, little fella  
But it'll cure your asthma too  
  
And I said look here brother  
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway?  
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

I've got troubles of my own, I said  
And you can't help me out  
So, take your meditations and your preparations  
And ram it up your snout!  
But I got the crystal ball, he said  
And held it to the ligh  
So I snatched it, all away from him  
And I showed him how to do it right  
  
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head  
So I looked like I was deep  
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then  
I told him he was going to sleep  
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch  
And everything else I found  
I had that sucker hypnotized  
He couldn't even make a sound  
I proceeded to tell him his future, then  
As long as he was hanging around  
I said the price of meat has just gone up  
And your old lady has just gone down!  
  
And I said look here brother-who you  
Jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now is that a real poncho or is that a sears poncho?  
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher?  
So, don't waste your time on me  
Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me

What sort of thing  
Might this lady get high upon?  
  
I checked out her sister  
Who was holding the bet  
And wondered what kind of trip  
The young lady was on  
The forty dollar bill didn't matter no more  
When her sister got naked and laid on the floor  
  
She said dinah-moe might win the bet  
But she could use a little if I wasn't done yet I told her...  
Just because the sun  
Want a place in the sky  
  
No reason to assume  
I wouldn't give her a try  
So I pulled on her hair  
Got her legs in the air  
  
And asked if she had any cooties on there  
  
She was buns-up kneeling  
Buns up!  
I was wheeling an dealing  
Wheeling and dealing an  
She surrendered to the feeling  
She sweetly surrendered  
An' she started in to squealing

With her lips just a-twitching an' her face gone red  
Some drool rolling down  
From the edge of her chin  
While she spied the condition  
Her sister was in  
  
She quivered and quaked  
And clutched at herself  
While her sister made a joke  
About her mental health  
  
Till dinah-moe finally  
Did give in  
But I told her  
All she really needed  
Was some discipline...  
  
Kiss my aura...  
Dora...  
M-m-m...  
It's real angora  
Would y'all like some more-a?  
  
Right here on the flora?  
An' how 'bout you, fauna?  
Why want to?  
Mmm...sound like why might be choking on something did you say you want some
more?  
Well, here's some more...  
  
Mmm, sure...listen  
Do you think I could interest you  
In a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers? mmm...tweezers!

customized by ran toon tan han toon frammet and dee. Followed by twelve
potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out
they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice with
your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner

But it doesn't matter no more...

As a result of people with hawaiian shirts on...

Lobsters up 'n down her pudenda  
All of them horribly large from graduation...  
And smelling very bad

And bring her back just like a mud-shark...

Our behavior is dumb  
And if our chances  
Expect to improve  
It's gonna take a lot more  
Than tryin' to remove  
The other race  
Or the other whatever  
From the face  
Of the planet altogether  
They call it the earth  
Which is a dumb kinda name  
But they named it right

Nurds on the right

On the air every night

Tells the story  
Makes the details  
Sound real gory  
'bout what to do

Don't believe in the book  
We got over here  
You can't run a race  
Without no feet  
'n pretty soon  
There won't be no street  
For dummies to jog on  
Or doggies to dog on  
Religious fanatics  
Can make it be all gone

'n disappear

For a thousand years...)

By a book of religion  
Not by a heap  
Or a lump or a smidgeon  
Of foolish rules  
Of ancient date  
Designed to make  
You all feel great  
While you fold, spindle  
And mutilate  
Those unbelievers  
From a neighboring state  
To arms! to arms!  
Hooray! that's great  
Two legs ain't bad  
Unless there's a crate  
They ship the parts  
To mama in  
For souvenirs: two ears (get down!)  
Not his, not hers, (but what the hey? )  
The good book says:  
(""it gotta be that way!"")  
But their book says:  
""revenge the crusades...  
With whips 'n chains  
'n hand grenades...""  
Two arms? two arms?  
Have another and another  
Our God says:  
""there ain't no other!""  
Our God says  
""it's all okay!""  
Our God says  
""this is the way!""  
It says in the book:  
""burn 'n destroy...  
'n repent, 'n redeem  
'n revenge, 'n deploy  
'n rumble thee forth  
To the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side  
'cause they don't go for what's in the book  
'n that makes 'em bad  
So verily we must choppeth them up  
And stompeth them down  
Or rent a nice french bomb  
To poof them out of existence  
While leaving their real estate just where we need it  
To use again  
For temples in which to praise our god  
(""cause he can really take care of business!"")  
And when his humble tv servant  
With humble white hair  
And humble glasses  
And a nice brown suit  
And maybe a blond wife who takes phone calls  
Tells us our God says  
It's okay to do this stuff  
Then we gotta do it,  
'cause if we don't do it,  
We ain't gwine up to hebbin!  
(depending on which book you're using at the  
Time...can't use theirs... it don't work  
...it's all lies...gotta use mine...)  
Ain't that right?  
That's what they say  
Every night...  
Every day...  
Hey, we can't really be dumb  
If we're just following god's orders  
Hey, let's get serious...  
God knows what he's doin'  
He wrote this book here  
An' the book says:  
He made us all to be just like him,""  
So...  
If we're dumb...  
Then God is dumb...

Flakes! flakes!  
They can't fix yer brakes  
You ask 'em, ""where's my motor? ""  
""well, it was eaten by snakes...""  
You can stab 'n' shoot 'n' spit  
But they won't be fixin' it  
They're lyin' an' lazy

Take it away, bob...  
I asked as nice as I could  
If my job would  
Somehow be finished by Friday  
Well, them whole damn weekend  
Came 'n' went, frankie  
Wanna buy some mandies, bob?  
'n' they didn't do nothin'  
But they charged me double for Sunday  
You know, no matter what you do,  
They gonna cheat 'n' rob you  
Then they'll send you a bill  
That'll get your senses reelin'  
And if you do not pay

It's a little bit cheesey,  
But it's nicely displayed  
Well we don't get excited when it  
Crumbles 'n' breaks  
We just get on the phone  
And call up some flakes  
They rush on over  
'n' wreck it some more  
'n' we are so dumb  
They're linin' up at our door  
Well, the toilet went crazy  
Yersterday afternoon  
The plumber he says  
Never flush a tampoon!  
This great information  
Cost me half a week's pay  
And the toilet blew up  
Later on the next day-ay-eee-ay  
Blew up the next day  
Woo-ooo  
We are millions 'n' millions,  
We're coming to get you  
We're protected by unions  
So don't let it upset you  
Can't escape the conclusion  
It's probably god's will  
That civilization  
Will grind to a standstill  
And we are the people  
Who will make it all happen  
While yer children is sleepin',  
Yer puppy is crappin'  
You might call us flakes  
Or something else you might coin us  
But we know you're so greedy  
That you'll probably join us  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you

Frank Zappa,Flambay,/f/frank+zappa/flambay_20056856.html,"He used to be very kind in his own crude way  
He wasn't always like I wanted him to be  
He wasn't smart, he wasn't handsome either  
But he thrilled me when he drilled me  
And I never loved a monster quite like he...  
  
Because his love was so flambay  
His kisses burned me so, his kisses turned me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
Here I stand all alone, a spider's fool  
  
When it's me he needs to fondle his tool  
I guess some bugs are just that way  
He don't really need your love  
He don't really need you  
To be there when his hair gets matted and grey  
With a broom cleaning his room from the mess he made that day  
All those earthling worms he nibbled away  
  
Oh hunchentoot my love, how could you desert me now?  
Oh hunchentoot you brute, can't you see I want you?  
Stay with me flagrantly  
And we'll have ecstasy for all eternity  
  
Because your love is so flambay  
You kisses burn me so, your kisses turn me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
I don't mind if you're unkind 'cause spiders rule  
  
Yes you are real cool  
With those little webs you spool  
And all your spider drool  
Oh let me float in your pool

When the last decrepit factory has dumped its final load of toxic waste into
the water supply and shipped its last badly manufactured, incompetently
designed consumer thing, we gaze in astonishment as the denizens of NU-PERFECT
AMERICA, dine on rats (mmmmm), poodles, Styrofoam packing pellets, all
floating in a broth of tritium-enriched sewage, roasting the least diseased
body parts of abandoned wild children accumulating since the total ban on
abortion a few years back.

The drinks were cheap (it was Ladies Nite)  
He was glad that he met her  
She was an office girl (""My name is Betty"")  
Her fav'right group was HELEN REDDY  
(They discussed the weather)  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
She was the lonely sort, just a little too short  
Her jokes were dumb and her fav'right sport  
Was hockey (in the winter)  
He was duly impressed and was quick to suggest  
Any sport with a PUCK had to be 'bout the best  
As he jabbed his elbow in her (""Get it honey? Get it?"")  
Later on they went off to where the music was soft,  
The candles were drippy, they saw a REAL HIPPY  
Who delivered their dinner  
The rice was brown, and soon they found  
That the crowd around that had jammed the room,  
Well it seemed to be getting thinner  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
He took her home to a motor court  
She wouldn't kiss him, he tried to ignore it,  
But it made him angry!  
Angry, it made me angry, it made me so angry I could have killed that  
Lousy BITCH!)  
He called her a slut, a pig and a whore  
A bitch and a cunt and she slammed the door  
In a petulant frenzy!  
(A petulant frenzy, this is a petulant frenzy.  
I'm petulant, and I'm having a frenzy)  
On the sofa she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she peeks  
Through the curtain  
He just got in his car  
But the battery's dead  
So he asks to use the phone  
And she gives him some head  
And that's the end of the story  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
Baby don't you want a man sometimes?

I was very glad  
Every happiness in the world  
Belonged to me  
Then our love was lost  
And you went away  
Now I shed my tears  
In lonely misery  
  
I know now that you never ever  
Really loved me  
It hurts me now to think you never ever  
Really cared  
I sit and ask myself a thousand times  
To try and find  
What really happened  
To the love  
That we shared  
  
How could I be such a fool  
How could I believe  
All those lies you told me  
How could I be taken in  
By your sweet face  
You spoiled our love  
You ruined my life  
I'm so tore down  
I'm a terrible disgrace  
  
But there will come a time  
And you'll regret the way  
You treated me  
As if I was a fool  
And didn't know  
The many times you lied  
About your love for me  
Someone else is gonna know  
That your love was just a show  
  
How could I be such a fool?

And you should go there  
Just try it for a while  
The people from nowhere  
Always smile  
Their eyes are all frozen over  
The sides of their faces pooch out at the corners  
Because that's what happens when their mouths turn up  
On both sides  
Which is why we can tell they're smiling  
They never frown  
They never let their eyebrows turn down  
They like going around with their teeth showing  
All the time  
They are from nowhere  
Your teeth are showing  
So maybe you been there  
You could have the disease of nowhere people  
Where the air gets stuck all over their gums  
When their nowhere lips roll back  
For real excitement  
They stand still  
They shut up  
Then they don't do nothing  
Out there in nowhere

At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway 9,  
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line  
Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap  
We gotta get out while we're young  
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
Wendy let me in I want to be your friend  
I want to guard your dreams and visions  
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims  
and strap your hands across my engines  
Together we could break this trap  
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back  
Will you walk with me out on the wire  
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider  
But I gotta find out how it feels  
I want to know if love is wild, girl I want to know if love is real  
  
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard  
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard  
The amusement park rises bold and stark  
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist  
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight  
In an everlasting kiss  
  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive  
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide  
Together Wendy we'll live with the sadness  
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul  
Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place  
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
