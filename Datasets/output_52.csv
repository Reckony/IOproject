Robbie Williams,Teenage Millionaire,/r/robbie+williams/teenage+millionaire_20116859.html,"Hi out there. This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W-A-N-K  
This evening I've got someone really interesting with me.  
He's over from old England and his name is Robbie Williams.  
  
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins!  
  
Great, right on! You know we've been hearing about this boy band that was
really big over there.  
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie?  
  
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first
place  
but to answer your question I can't really answer it.  
I suppose it was a bit like this  
  
Ha  
Riding in your limos  
Hanging with your bimbos  
Riding my old faithful  
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable  
Kipper in the papers  
Coke and whisky chasers  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Services for Britain  
Pouting like a kitten  
Dinner with Diana  
I'm a social Stokey spanner  
Waiting for my knighthood  
She can pin it on my manhood  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
(It works out sometimes it's funny  
Being stupid makes you lots of money)  
  
Bothered Judy Garland  
When I ordered Barbara Cartland  
Champagne in my bidet  
The press all had a field day  
You may think it's an outrage  
My cleaner is wearing bondage  
She makes my place a mess  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
Come on waif  
It looks as if you need a good feeling

Act One is about to begin in 8 seconds.  
  
First you can't act, now you can't stop,

I used to like you a lot,  
(I was the class nerd)  
Exactly who I'm s'posed to be,

You play a doctor on TV,

Deep down you're dirty but you try,  
(I'm a good person)  
The truth would break you so you lie,

It's in the choices that you make,

No talent, just fate.

I end, we start

Good from far but far from good,  
(All I have is my instinct)  
You love to act, I wish you would,  
(It's not acting, it's re-acting)  
Act like you're not from out of space,

You know ambition isn't grace,

Made of Sex, Maida Vale,

Robbie Williams,The Lady Is A Tramp,/r/robbie+williams/the+lady+is+a+tramp_20540149.html,"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater, but doesn't come late  
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair  
Life without care  
She's broke, but it's o'k  
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
Doesn't like dice games, with sharpies and frauds  
Won't go to Harlem, in Lincolns or Fords  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those broads  
That's why the lady is a tramp

Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on  
  
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my  
Imagination will feed my hungry heart  
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on  
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you  
Weaving romances, making believe they're true  
  
Give me your lips for just a moment and my  
Imagination will make that moment live  
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on

Rod Stewart,A Night Like This,/r/rod+stewart/a+night+like+this_20117465.html,"Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway  
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad  
Thinking I'm gay  
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport  
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort  
(Of a guy)  
  
But there's one thing I'm lacking  
It's sexual experience  
So I ask you, my sweetheart  
Save me from this wilderness  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
  
Where I come from, love is  
Just a hole in the wall  
And the steel mills ring out and generations  
Heed the call  
  
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey  
And the chance of romance  
Slim as a bright sunny day  
  
This is partly the reason  
I'm so overwhelmed and shy  
Because your beauty, by contrast  
Is gonna make a young man cry  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
  
You don't know what it means to a boy from  
A suburban home  
To be left with a woman like you  
Completely alone  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
Nice place you've got here, babe  
Never seen a house like this  
  
Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch  
  
All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck  
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke  
(Than me)  
  
So here we are, the record's  
Gotten stuck in the groove  
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey  
Of a night like this  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

Then in love you live.  
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.)  
I'll be the rock you can build on,  
Be there when you're old,  
To have and to hold.  
  
When there's love inside  
(I swear I'll always be strong.)  
Then there's a reason why.  
(I'll prove to you we belong.)  
I'll be the wall that protects you  
From the wind and the rain,  
From the hurt and pain.  
  
Let's make it all for one and all for love.  
Let the one you hold be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.  
When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love.  
  
When it's love you make  
(I'll be the fire in your night.)  
Then it's love you take.  
(I will defend, I will fight.)  
I'll be there when you need me.  
When honor's at stake,  
This vow I will make:  
  
That it's all for one and all for love.  
Let the one be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.  
When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love.  
  
Don't lay our love to rest  
Cause we could stand up to the test.  
We got everything and more, than we had planned,  
More than the rivers that run the land.  
We've got it all, in our hands.  
  
Now it's all for one and all for love.  
(It's all for love)  
Let the one you hold be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all

When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
When there's someone that you want,

Rod Stewart,All In The Name Of Rock 'n' Roll,/r/rod+stewart/all+in+the+name+of+rock+n+roll_20117129.html,"Went downtown on the two forty-nine,  
Playin' for recognition of the New York town.  
See, me and the boys got a rock 'n' roll band,  
They were so damn good, gonna lift up the man.  
  
Well, we got ups, we got downs,  
We got just so high 'til the sun goes down.  
Got the ego, can be abused,  
I got my two-toned shoes,  
And I can sing the blues.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look out, kids, it's the F. B. I.  
We got a problem, you keep me high.  
Put on your clothes, take the smile off your face  
And put your money where your mouth is or get out this place.  
  
New York town is a meanass town,  
We got a thousand bands singin' underground.  
Way down in New Orleans it's the same old thing,  
Emotional music, a merry old thing.  
  
Old King Soul, he finally gave us a jolt,  
He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four.  
He played upside down, he played inside out,  
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gettin' hungry I know little woman,  
Can't get a smell 'cause my nose is blocked.  
I'm so high, I can't believe it,  
Hotel dogs are knockin' on my door.  
  
Two night of singin' nearly out on the end,  
Left the two parts red, oh what a square.  
As soon as the man, there's no sweeter song,  
Listen, McCartney, we're the band on the run.

Oh yeah.

That I ever seen her face  
I was standing by the drug store  
Tryin' to save the human race  
  
Took a raincheck on a blind date  
To get her prescription filled  
We had a short talk and a long walk  
Through the lazy cottonfield  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
She's wonderful, so beautiful  
So delectable, she's mine  
She's desirable, so lovable

When I heard a farmer shout  
""Get away, boy, from my daughter!""  
When a shotgun rang out  
We took off  
She was right behind me  
Ran like the wind  
What a crazy lady  
  
She's fabulous, so sensuous  
She's marvelous, she's mine  
I'm delirious, it's serious  
Kinda dangerous, almost illegal

And another on the way

How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds  
In a believer's ear  
It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds  
And drives away his fear  
  
Must Jesus bear the cross alone  
And all the world go free  
No, there's a cross for you  
And there's a cross for me

This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
well Maybe just one little kiss more - Put some music on while I pour

To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay - Get over that old out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr its cold  
It's cold out there  
Cant you stay awhile longer baby  
Well I really shouldn't alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ahh, do that again

Early stop leave the city behind us  
Good to be the kid that cares alot  
We got just us  
  
We going Starbucks a doner and a coffee  
That's when I notice it was all around me  
And do today and there's gotta be a winner  
Rolling out the summer we're tired of winter  
  
Still left on we're climbing all of our years  
Still had hair on a true to fear  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive

No hesitation and we check into our hotel  
Down about a woosh about a mile at the disco  
Up toss the bed in a room that I seen you  
I just sat here loving that person in me  
  
Don't you worry 'cause I'm back in my case  
Get down to the beach and let the sun on your face  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive

But what an end  
This is the time

And drove her to her home

Started to come on strong  
Then she said so candidly  
As I was gettin' down on my knees

But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy""

With a winning personality  
Natural born leader  
With connections in society  
But late at night  
Alone with just his wealth  
He would stare in the mirror  
And never see himself  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
He had a hit with every song  
Sounded like something's wrong  
Why, why, why, why, why

Ain't nothing but, nothin' but  
Nothin' but camouflage

With an ambiance you can't ignore  
But nobody realized  
What went on behind closed doors  
He had many affairs  
But never felt fulfilled  
She would hide her sadness  
In alcohol and pills  
She bottled everything up inside  
He was too busy with his best friend's wife

French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe  
They wouldn't give you the time of day

Farewell all my family, don't you know I mean you so well  
Please appreciate I must make a break  
Just to see what I can do  
The stage is set so understand, I can't hide in the wings no more  
I've got to go now it's no use me staying home

I can make a new start

It was too good to ever end.  
Once in a while someone like you  
Will give everything for what you wanted to do.  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend play it again.  
  
You gave the world a whole lot of joy  
Now that ain't bad for a country boy  
I just knew you could not lose  
The way you sang rock and roll and blues.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again  
  
Sometimes I think about James Dean,  
Sammy Cooke and my teenage queen.  
Doo ron, de ron, de ron,  
Marilyn Monroe and hot rod fun.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings.  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend why did it end?  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend, why did it end.

With your new love  
  
There in the darkness of  
My house without windows  
I will never see the stars that shine  
Shine on you, and your new love  
  
I'd rather wonder through this endless night  
Than to face the light of another lonely day  
Knowing that you won't be there  
There to share, these two arms ever again  
  
I'll take all my broken dreams  
And I'll take my broken heart  
And from now on you will find me there  
Crying there, trying to forget  
In my house without windows  
In my house without windows  
And without love

That he needs all kinds of people

From the castles in the distance

On the path of least resistance  
  
Cities full of hatred  
Fear and lies  
Withered hearts  
And cruel, tormented eyes  
Scheming demons

Their bitterness on youth

Sought alone to rule the fate of man  
  
They battled through the ages  
But still neither force would yield  
The people were divided  
Every soul a battlefield  
Every soul a battlefield  
  
I bring truth and understanding  
I bring wit and wisdom fair  
Precious gifts beyond compare  
  
We can build a world of wonder  
I can make you all aware  
I will find you food and shelter  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storm  
  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform

Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise  
  
But one day the streets fell silent  
Yet they knew not what was wrong  
They urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong  
  
The wise men were consulted  
And the bridge of death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus  
To find out what they had lost

In the darkness of the night  
In the heart's eternal light

Food and wine they had aplenty  
And they slept beneath the stars  
The people were contented  
And the Gods watched from afar  
  
But the winter fell upon them  
And it caught them unprepared  
Bringing wolves and cold starvation  
And the hearts of men despaired  
  
The universe divided  
As the heart and mind collided  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years  
In a cloud of doubts and fears  
Their world was torn asunder  
Into hollow hemispheres  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other  
Most just followed one another  
Lost aimless like their brothers  
For their hearts were so unclear  
And the truth could not appear  
Their spirits were divided  
Into blinded hemispheres  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light  
My Rocinante sailed by night  
On her final flight  
  
To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force  
We set our course  
Spiraled through that timeless space  
To this immortal race  
  
I have memory and awareness  
But I have no shape or form  
As a disembodied spirit  
I am dead and yet unborn  
I have passed into Olympus  
As was told in tales of old  
To the city of immortals  
Marble white and purest gold  
  
I see the Gods in battle rage on high  
Thunderbolts across the sky  
I cannot move, I cannot hide  
I feel a silent scream begin inside  
  
Then all at once the chaos ceased  
A stillness fell, a sudden peace  
The warriors felt my silent cry  
And stayed their struggle mystified  
  
Apollo was astonished  
Dionysus thought me mad  
But they heard my story further  
And they wondered and were sad  
  
Looking down from Olympus  
On a world of doubt and fear  
It's surface splintered  
Into sorry hemispheres  
  
They sat a while in silence  
Then they turned at last to me  
(We will call you Cygnus)  
(The God of balance you shall be)  
  
We can walk our road together  
If our goals are all the same  
We can run alone and free  
If we pursue a different aim  
  
Let the truth of love be lighted  
Let the love of truth shine clear sensibility  
Armed with sense and liberty  
With the heart and mind united  
In a single, perfect, sphere

He'd love to spend the night in Zion  
He's been a long while in Babylon  
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on  
To a tropic isle of Avalon  
  
His world is under anesthetic  
Subdivided and synthetic  
His reliance on the giants  
In the science of the day  
  
He picks up scraps of information  
He's adept at adaptation  
Cause for strangers and arrangers  
Constant change is here to stay  
  
He's got a force field and a flexible plan  
He's got a date with fate in a black sedan  
He plays fast forward for as long as he can  
But he won't need a bed  
He's a digital man

No singing in the acid rain

Passing through revolving doors

And someone to sweep the floors

But what am I to do?

But I worry about you  
I know it makes no difference  
To what you're going through  
But I see the tip of the iceberg  
And I worry about you...  
  
Cruising under your radar  
Watching from satellites  
Take a page from the red book  
Keep them in your sights

That the truth is not the truth?

Rush,Dog Years,/r/rush/dog+years_20120072.html,"In a dog's life  
A year is really more like seven  
And all too soon a canine  
Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven  
  
It seems to me  
As we make our own few circles 'round the sun  
We get it backwards  
And our seven years go by like one  
  
Dog years...It's the season of the itch  
Dog years...With every scratch it reappears  
  
In the dog days  
People look to Sirius  
Dogs cry for the moon  
But these connections are mysterious  
  
It seems to me  
While it's true that every dog will have his day  
When all the bones are buried  
There is barely time to go outside and play  
  
Dog years...It's the season of the itch  
Dog years...With every scratch it reappears  
Dog years...For every sad son of a bitch  
Dog years...With his tail between his ears  
  
I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos  
Or a span of geological time  
Than be living in these dog years  
  
In a dog's brain  
A constant buzz of low-level static  
One sniff at the hydrant  
And the answer is automatic  
  
It seems to me  
As well make our own few circles 'round the block  
We've lost our senses  
For the higher-level static of talk

Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I was drifting for half the night  
Anxious and restless,  
Pressed down by the darkness  
Bound up and wound up so tight  
So many decisions, a million revisions  
Caught between and light...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
World of polished steel  
Gears and iron chains  
Turn the grinding wheel  
I run between the shadows  
Some are phantoms, some are real  
  
Where would you rather be?  
Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
The doubt and the fear  
I know would all disappear  
Anywhere but here  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I heard voices behind the door  
The known and the nameless,  
Familiar and faceless  
My angels and my demons at war  
Which one will lose - depends on what I choose  
Or maybe which voice I ignore...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
Streets of cold desire  
My precious sense of honor  
Just a shield of rusty wire  
I hold against the chaos  
And the cross of holy fire  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
So easy to deceive  
My precious sense of rightness  
Is sometimes so naive  
So that which I imagine  
Is that which I believe  
  
On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright  
Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness  
I knew which direction was right  
The case had been tried by the jury inside  
The choice between darkness and light...

Driven to the edge of control

Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves  
Stealing in and out back alleys  
Driven to another den of thieves  
  
But it's my turn to drive

Driven out --- On the thin end of the wedge

Driven on --- By the road to somewhere I've never been

Stretching out your hand  
Full of starlit diamonds

And my third-hand grace

You're still out of reach  
Form a dream to rise to

Not content with being cool  
We must throw ourselves wide open  
And start acting like a fool  
If we need too much approval  
Then the cuts can seem too cruel  
  
Right to the heart of the matter  
Right to the beautiful part  
Illusions are painfully shattered  
Right where discovery starts  
In the secret wells of emotion  
Buried deep in our hearts  
  
It's true that love can change us  
But never quite enough  
Sometimes we are too tender  
Sometimes we're too tough  
If we get too much attention

So often fragile power turns  
To scorn and ridicule  
Sometimes our big splashes  
Are just ripples in the pool  
Feelings run high

Alone and yet together

Just between us

The differences we sometimes feared to show  
Just between us  
I think it's time for us to realize  
The spaces in between

For you and I to grow  
  
We are strangers to each other  
Full of sliding panels  
An illusion show  
Acting well-rehearsed routines  
Or playing from the heart?

Building hopeful bridges  
On the troubled sea

Like the days were carved in stone  
You get all wired up inside

Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst

The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence

When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...

With passion and precision

By sickness and indecision

The mess and the magic  
Triumphant and tragic  
A mechanized world, out of hand  
  
Computerized clinic  
For superior cynics  
Who dance to a synthetic band  
  
In their own image  
Their world is fashioned,  
No wonder they don't understand  
  
Wheels within wheels  
In a spiral array  
A pattern so grand  
And complex  
Time after time  
We lose sight of the way  
Our causes can't see  
Their effects  
  
Permanent Waves  
Science, like Nature  
Must also be tamed  
With a view towards its preservation  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely serve us well  
  
Art as expression,  
Not as market campaigns  
Will still capture our imaginations  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely help us along  
  
The most endangered species,  
The honest man  
Will still survive annihilation  
Forming a world,  
State of integrity  
Sensitive, open, and strong  
  
Wave after wave  
Will flow with the tide  
And bury the world as it does  
Tide after tide  
Will flow and recede  
Leaving life to go on  
As it was...

For they passed a noble law  
And the trees are all kept equal  
By hatchet,

Through the streets, move the sheep  
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd  
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving  
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
It's clear to me now  
  
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how  
Now, we moving planets  
Take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged  
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done  
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one

Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion  
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down  
Tell me, how long has it been  
Is everything, everything alright my friend  
  
You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting  
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel  
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real  
Oh, do you like the way that it's going down  
Do you like the way that it's going down

That' going 'round and 'round I can feel it pull me down

That this world is a perfect place to live  
There is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give  
All the leaves such a haunting melody  
That forever will be a part of me  
  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Floating alone no one around me or beyond me  
The sun is on me  
  
Then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze  
That did caress me and possess me  
Oh it astounds me  
  
All around there's a feeling in the air  
That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there  
But day by day I can see they walk away  
And I wonder, Lord will they ever know  
  
That this world is a perfect place to live?  
Just look into your heart, find the love that's there to give  
Realize that the secret is to share

Of the needy who can be assisted  
And the famished who can be fed

When they say our world has no meaning  
As long as others are still not free  
What shall we think of the dreamers  
When they no longer listen to what we say  
When their silence leaves us uneasy  
And they refuse to go away  
For they dream of fanciful figures  
Poised in mid flight

Might describe?  
Or would a thousand lovers  
Still leave you cold inside?  
Make you cry  
These tears of pearls

We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world  
  
Your kisses are like pearls,  
So different and so rare  
But anger stole the jewels away  
And love has left you bare,  
Made you cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
Well I could be the tired joker  
Pour my heart to get you in  
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win  
Maybe cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world

Like fallen soldiers we will learn  
Once forgotten, twice removed

But it makes no sense at all  
I'm confused by what I feel  
I thought that our love  
Was something that is real

Can't find it anymore

So many things that I recall  
When we were young just flying high  
Can we turn our fate at all  
I wish we could say don't you cry  
I'm confused by what I hear  
Girl it seems to me  
We're losing after all

Painting torrid colors to a sky of green  
Candle breathing one night only

Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow,  
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time  
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow  
To call the Thing  
Sublime!

No time for bleeding  
Show the world how  
Someday is now  
  
Eight steps till I reach the summit  
My line breaks and I fall down  
The rocky terrain  
My bones are broken into pieces

To get up and do it again

No turning back, no more yesterdays  
I just won't get lost in the haze  
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow  
Watch out for the rest of my days

Is there a Heaven in the sky  
Why can't we get it right

We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one

Fading shadows one by one  
We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice  
I saw the children  
The children of the sun  
How they wept, how they bled, how they died  
  
Do you ever ask yourself  
Is there a Heaven in the sky

We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care

We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love  
  
And does it really matter  
If there's a heaven up above  
We sure could use some love

No tongue can bid me thence depart

And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see Him there  
Who made an end to all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  
For God the just is satisfied  
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there the risen Lamb  
My perfect spotless righteousness  
The great unchangeable I am  
The King of glory and of grace

It Is Well With My Soul  
Words and Music by Horatio Spafford  
  
When peace like a river attendeth my way  
When sorrows like sea billows roll  
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
It is well with my soul  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought  
My sin, not in part, but the whole  
Has been nailed to the cross  
So I bear it no more  
Praise The Lord, praise The Lord, oh my soul.  
  
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight  
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll  
The trump shall resound and The Lord shall descend  
Even so, it is well with my soul.

Dead-end streets and boulevards  
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart

Who would've thought you'd feel so cold  
And all these memories seem so old  
To think you were my everything

But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

It's like you camouflage

I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten

Riding alone on the 405  
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry  
If that's the last time I'd see you again  
But I'll never tell you just how I felt  
You might just not care, and it might just not help  
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Is what you wish to sell.  
There is no heaven without a hell.  
  
In your mind's eye could you truly believe,  
That by giving you can save your soul,  
Could you be so naive!  
You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,  
You blind the congregation  
With the things you say.  
  
Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,  
That death will come and all will be lost.  
  
Can you hear the serpents call,  
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.  
Ignore the writing on the wall,  
You should read between the lies.  
  
When doubt subsides his honesty,  
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?  
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,  
No sermons left to hide or cover,  
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,  
To steal a dream or get it killed.  
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,  
You may believe it but Satan wouldn't lie.

Suicidal mind from the start  
Endless pain, open wounds, slit the throat  
Radiation child seeks the throne  
  
Strafing down demigods certain death  
Coming from the stars, lord of all  
Dark rift rise, flourish life, perish man  
We destroy ourselves, cease to live  
Children's blood feed the dead sea of flesh  
Catastrophic fall rest in hell  
Flaming corpse, screaming eyes, watch it die  
Walk among the dead, pick your grave  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Like a disease spreading death  
Erasing your existence  
  
Satan's hand begins the end  
And frees the world forever  
Gomorrah's dream to live in sin  
Has reached its critical mass  
Man himself has become God  
And laughs at his destruction  
In which we trust a secret government  
Is now in total collapse  
  
Disease spreading death  
Entire population dies  
Dead before you're born  
Massive suicide  
Vicious game of fear  
It's all extermination now  
Poison in your veins  
Global genocide  
Slaughter governs law  
The apocalypse begins  
Pain becomes the norm  
Seeking homicide  
Beware the coming storm  
That starts illuminating fires  
God is laughing hard  
Man has gone insane  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood

He just wants to live his life this way  
  
A scanty bit of a thing  
With a decorative ring  
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose  
As Rose collects the money in a canister  
Who comes sliding down the bannister ?  
The Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
The monkish monsignor  
With a head full of plaster  
Said : ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again  
My God!  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh...  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh...  
  
The next day in the pulpit  
With freedom and ease  
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again and again and again  
  
In the fabric of a tutu  
Any man could get used to  
And I am the living sign  
And I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign

All held together by a management glue

Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene  
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends  
I hope things get better for you  
Cause I'ma make things get better for me  
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB

When I mob, make marks across the street  
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail  
For the bow-wow LBC style  
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper  
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever  
I want em close enough so I can lock on em  
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em  
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em

Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?

Busting, no need for discussion  
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust  
Close enough to touch then rush

The closest nigga to you would do you and try to screw you  
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you  
And he could be the same nigga the switch  
Playin all one minute but he really is a bitch  
Now watch out for the twist  
Here come them niggaz that was with you but they out to get rich  
But you thought them niggaz would never do that  
Until they came back strapped with them rat-tat-tat-tats  
And it always ends up fucked up  
When the innocent die it'll have yo brain stuck  
It'll have yo brains stuck shit outta luck cause I'm havin bad luck  
Fucked up in my younger days  
Shit I'll bang you with deuces and hang you with trays  
A few days back one of homies got rugged out  
Damn shame all the brothers seem drugged out  
One of seeds bust a bottle over the bizis head  
Say it's yo fault that the otha bizis layin dead  
But it's a fact if you pack nigga bust back  
Neva run throw our gun unless you fall rat

Told my babymama it wus drama unfoldin  
I kissed all my kids den commits to strollin  
Wound uptown on a hot ass block  
Checkin with some chickens gettin hot ass cock  
Daily Tray-Dee'll loose pursuit  
But deez ho's broke and don't look to cute  
So I parlay to the hard ways of jackin  
Fast came to cash but the mash was crackin  
I didn't I was the one to be  
Kickin summary of sum wen I let em slide up under me  
But God as my witness  
As a G I couldn't see Dee just goin out sensless  
I stayed hard hit the yard  
Pull niggaz hole cards  
Had em runnin to the sarge  
Jail house scars tell the part you played  
Livin with a snitch jackin destined for the brake  
It don't pay to go soft  
Cause when we catch you slippin real niggas takin off motherfuckers

Quick to dick a hoe and get that big homie for a 64  
He ain't goin' miss it though  
  
'Cause I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone  
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome

Hangin' out all in front of my home  
  
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own  
Now it's really on  
'Cause I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit  
Put that switches on his riches  
  
Now his bitch is my bitch

See that's the plan I was brainwashed not to know  
  
But nigga fuck what you goin' through this 2-0  
And by that time I'm 17 if I ain't in that pin  
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin' again  
Ridin', hoo-bangin' like Mack 10  
  
Back on tha streets again and strapped in

Bang to that boogie and boogie to that bang

Not to mention that homeboys locked down in tha p now  
See now that road get shaky but you can't break  
Watch out for them hood rats, snakes  
  
'Cause E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt  
The lil' homie did too much dirt and got worked  
Now he's on the run and dyin' of thirst  
Stayin' at his girls spot on 21st  
  
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst  
'Cause he might not make it to tha last verse  
But meanwhile back in tha p now

Ya gots to be able to bang like yourself man  
So whether you bangin' for crip or blood

But these streets won't say a goodbye  
  
I can't say goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye

[Verse 1]  
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy  
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy  
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy  
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,  
Let them do them take care of your own boy""  
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy  
You had dreams of being a dope boy  
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po  
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'  
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,  
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first  
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church  
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st  
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse  
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me,  
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me  
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,  
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,  
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted  
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they
owe me  
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops  
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man  
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not  
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot,
man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Thank good every day that the boy could spit  
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit  
I know I got plenty more wars to get  
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids  
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit  
They made me how I am, the music in the man  
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn  
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan  
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand  
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man  
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand  
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans  
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins  
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids  
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name  
Would live... In the streets

I'm on the run but I can't walk yet  
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet  
First trip in the police car  
Cameras all around me as if I was a star  
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me  
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)  
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and  
That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'  
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'  
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'  
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's  
Twenty days later I'm from are-T-see  
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up  
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck  
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up  
Havin' fun and stuff  
You niggas don't want none of us

What's up homie (What's up 'cause, where you from)  
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)  
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)

Roll with me, S-N-double O-P  
Mel-man where ya been O.G.  
Tell me, the game'll never fail me  
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby  
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby  
This is the dopest G, that you will ever see  
There'll never be, another me  
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me  
Pause, do it to em' dogg  
Now drop a rock em' dogg  
Now put a lock em' dogg  
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log  
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho  
Get me a Michelob, now I want to Snicker though  
Remind me of the old days  
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays  
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style

You can rock to tha rythme you see

Make sure you do your thang on a hang

Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop  
Have prestigious women  
That's the truth from the beginning  
In and out of the flyest hotels  
  
You say your family don't know me  
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos  
Sales, tails, scales and jails  
Success before death  
  
No one in my clique fails  
As females with the almighty Father lead  
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need  
And it ain't no party like this kind,

Tears and sweat  
And you breakin' your neck  
And you still up in debt.  
Walkin' round town all strapped in,  
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.  
Two strikes none left, out of breath  
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.  
All this deception on top of stress,  
You havin' more problems than a algebra test.  
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,  
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.  
It's a thin line, between yours and mine  
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.  
Now I know a place where  
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

Oh your homies think you're funny?  
Doin' stick ups for moneys  
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)  
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,  
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.  
You all about yo' money and got something to sell  
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.  
You chillin' with yo' feet up  
Someone hated but baby without the homies and  
That's when you got beat up.  
Because you can't be out there doin' low  
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll.  
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,  
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.  
But see, I know a place where  
You might wanna be  
And I can take you there

Bigger than the mayor.

And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got  
To be a player.

Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)  
Fuck that nigga yo

Tooting on that cocaine, fucking wit that wrong thing

Also, I believe in comparing the cock  
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)

Not just knee deep, she was totally deep  
When she went down on me  
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off  
Oh wee, baby you's a freak  
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta  
But my homey fell in love and he banked her  
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist  
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist  
  
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back  
And he get his third strike wit no get back

And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend  
Say she doing too much, hell yeah she doing too much

Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting  
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin  
Pardon me, cause I ain't mad when you get bent  
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. spray

Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note  
You doing too much when you clutching on my touch-tone  
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone  
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power  
And only get to hit a cold shower  
You faking like you're making more moves than Simpson  
But fronting, pushing buttons, doing nothing but sin

Home of the NBA championship

It's the city where you shoot your favorite television episode  
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard  
But you gotta have a low-rider car  
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'  
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon  
That's how we represent it though  
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64, yeah I love showing it out  
First things first my nig', you better know where you at

On my way to pick up baby

Man, this place is crazy  
I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it  
Summer time in Cali  
  
Rollin' down Fairfax  
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico  
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes  
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues  
About 9 o'clock stop by the record shop  
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball  
Life is a mystery, my life is like history  
Stop by my dispensary, give me some kush and pusha  
Put it in the trunk, smelling like a skunk  
But it's all legal in LA, everybody taking a hit  
From the politicians, athletes and even the teachers  
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher  
He say ""Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya""  
Yeah, I love showing you that  
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at

Snoop Dogg,Freaky Tales,/s/snoop+dogg/freaky+tales_20127242.html,"These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
  
I met this girl her name was Joan  
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone  
When I met Joan I took her home  
She was just like a doggie all on my bone  
  
I met another girl her name was Ann  
All she wanted was to freak with a man  
When I met Ann, I shook her hand  
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can  
  
The next young freak, I met was Red  
I took her to my house and she gave me head  
She like blowin' dicks, is all she said  
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed  
  
There's another girl, her name is Sherry  
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary  
I heard she was freakin' from my big brother Jerry  
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry  
  
Young and tender, sweet Denise  
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast  
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece  
She'll only start talkin' bout signin' a lease  
  
I met a young tender, her name is Lori  
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story  
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa  
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser  
  
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle  
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale  
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well  
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell  
  
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi  
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was 'flantly'  
She had a best friend, her name was Janet  
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game  
  
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan  
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam  
The very next day, I saw her with her man  
One week passed, and I was in her again  
  
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine  
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen  
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend  
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans  
  
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy  
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me  
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta  
A country broad from Alabama  
  
I met this freak, her name was Beth  
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death  
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin' sweat  
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath  
  
Bake, and, shake, ups  
I met this freak in Vegas  
She she said her name was Don-na  
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na  
  
I said, ""I don't pimp, or gigolo  
I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe  
You can break yourself, but you can't break me  
You never met a player like Snoop baby""  
  
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe  
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'  
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'  
She was down on her knees, beggin' to blow  
  
She's like another freak, named Renee  
You get her all alone and she'll make your day  
Like Burger King, she knows the play  
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way  
  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well!

If I stumble, then I'll fall

Ohhhhhhh  
  
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up  
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind  
But I'm kind-hearted  
And don't like being stepped on  
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position  
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say  
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day  
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody  
But you know what I never do?  
Smoke it off like Gotti  
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones  
Tray Deee and Snoop, we sound good on this microphone  
I never threaten nobody to make it happen  
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'  
But if I had a chance to give it back  
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that  
Do that, straight from the heart  
Eastside till I die  
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life  
  
It's a trip how we Crip  
Suppose the enemies still  
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears  
Insane's and twenties both from the same city  
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many  
Me, see, and the G can think back to the start  
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park  
And having a heart  
To get 'em up if it was beef  
Head up like G's, take it out in the street  
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view  
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few  
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case  
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase  
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke  
A Insane with a twenty, now we hell of a close  
And why'all kids, my kids, so we family now  
Cause I could never see you doing bad without  
And that's real  
  
Life is much mo' precious  
Than you'll think  
Like a game'll make yo chips sink  
It's so hard  
Hard to trust a smile and face

Great scotts, it's hot today  
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest  
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air  
His vision getting blurry but you know I didn't care  
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck  
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck  
Shooting like a motherfucking Vietnam vet  
Riding on this nigga disrespecting my set  
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots  
On the hood getting hot, anybody can drop  
You better have a spot up in town my nigga  
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga  
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat  
Grease strikes you out with no get back  
Wishing for a steak eating on a Kit Kat  
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that  
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me  
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me  
We can ride on some niggas for nothing at all  
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em  
LBC in this motherfucker cause  
I had to show these niggas what time it was  
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns  
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves  
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip  
Or better yet, strapped a clip  
To a motherfucking' nine millimeter for heater  
And put the ride down out of G two seater  
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that  
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that  
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back  
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack  
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack  
I brought the curl back and the golf hat  
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps  
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks  
I brought snaps to the game nigga  
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga  
S-N double O-P fa sho  
I do my thang way cut throat on the down-low  
Oh once upon a time in the LBC  
There lived a OG from the DPG  
And all the little kids looked up to him  
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him  
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel

Cool in the waterway  
Where the baptized drown  
Naked in the cold sun  
Breathing life like fire  
Thought I was the only one  
But that was just a lie

Cause I heard it in the wind  
And I saw it in the sky  
And I thought it was the end  
And I thought it was the 4th of July  
  
Pale in the flare light  
The scared light cracks and disappears  
And leads the scorched ones here  
And everywhere no one cares  
The fire is spreading  
And no one wants to speak about it  
Down in the hole  
Jesus tries to crack a smile  
Beneath another shovel load

Now I'm in control  
Now I'm in the fall out  
Once asleep but now I stand  
And I still remember  
Your sweet everything  
Light a roman candle  
And hold it in your hand

Gotta be peace o' mind and a piece o' living  
When the losers have won and the damage is done  
Only then will you be saved  
She dancing on thin ice while her mind is skating  
He's building on the dust that is suffocating  
And a baby that cries in a city of lies  
For a freedom that is craved  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Sunny had a street that she couldn't live in  
Sunny had a room that she couldn't breath in  
But a heart that could feel and a hand that could heal  
And a passion filled with rage  
I never felt the air with a wind of change  
I only felt a storm with a wind and rain  
A city so deep, a soul without sleep  
And a heart that's filled with pain  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Look out on a million dreams  
There's fire in all those schemes  
I feel the burn of investigation  
Love will be your inspiration  
Baby, lets go again  
On me and you it all depends  
The power of love is a powerful friend  
And I will love you till the end  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow around  
When will love blow all through Windy Town

And didn't look back  
Her life was changed in an instant  
The van was filled up  
And tied to the rack  
Her home that now seemed so distant  
Kissing goodbye  
To her friends on the stairs  
She felt a loss deep within her  
Sat in the front seat with stuff everywhere  
The neighbours said they would ring her  
They moved to the sea front  
And loved their new view  
Of tides coming in on the shingle  
She and her daughter  
Found new things to do  
At last it was good to be single  
And in the summer  
The place came alive  
Lights on the pier in the evening  
The fresh sea air  
And could cut with a knife  
Such a wonderful feeling  
  
She worked in a pub  
Where bands would appear  
On a tiny stage in the corner  
She watched them load in  
With tattered old gear  
The place would get like a sauna  
London had gone now  
Her new life was strong  
She found herself a new karma  
She fell for a man  
Who played with a band  
And took her life from it's drama  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
The past was neatly extinguished  
He was much younger  
But she lived with that  
He struggled hard with his english  
She felt his loving  
And proudly reclaimed  
All of the warmth she'd been lacking  
They lay in bed  
Looking out at the rain  
No more moving or packing  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
Her life had changed in an instant

I stuck my neck out and I looked at his face  
I left her standing, I was caught in a chase

The cathedral is empty, no one's at home  
Winter's approaching paradise postponed

Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost,  
The rain won't stop falling and the people look lost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost.

I watched the flinstones and I turned my dial  
To a brand new station where the beat comes in

The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
It's fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing I've ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound I've ever heard  
Was a baby's cry in this wicked world

Leaves me cold and my heart cries

In a table of froth  
The bar girl is serving  
With a check drying cloth  
She'll bend over backwards even though she's knackered  
I wonder if there'll have her up in heaven  
  
Like the sailors I walk home, it's six a.m.  
Heaven's round the corner in a comfortable bed  
And I love her.  
  
The officers and seamen  
Elbow places at the bar  
Words that tempt the goddess  
Don't leave beats upon the heart  
But she'll service his pleasure  
And never know the treasure  
That his wife keeps forever up in heaven  
  
The first light of the morning  
Proves too much for the street  
No one sees each other  
Just their presence there to meet  
Your chin takes to stubble at the sight of a funnel  
And the gangplank is no trouble up to heaven

Then my ears start to block  
All the words that you say  
Through the night, through the day  
Where there's muck there is brass  
And the storm soon will pass  
Then it's back to the norm  
All the cold turns to warm  
  
Sometimes I think life crawls like a snail  
And all of our dreams become the wind in your sails  
Without wealth it's true, who cares what you do

I can see the ears that listen when we talk

Squint my eyes to see from my fame  
Spot the words that fall from my lines  
The deafness hides the light from the blind  
  
Stop starting journey  
The road returns me  
Back to the world in the evening  
The stage rehearsals  
Voice on the circles  
Blah blah my way to the ceiling

Are there people sitting out there  
Feed me with a frown or a laugh  
Featureless the faces that ask

Footlight the visual of my lines

Asks a lot of questions  
Answers hard to find.

My arms reach to hold her  
Hungry for the love

Down there toy town the twinkle of lights  
The long white beaches of holiday time  
Suddenly someone has pulled out a gun  
His shout for attention has everyone stunned  
Hands on our heads there's a new kind of fear  
We're over the barrel with the hits of the year  
  
Held up to ransom assured we'll be safe

How many gods can there be in one sky  
All so important and all so involved  
Here on a trigger a disciple of fear  
As we wait without knowing if we're hits of the year

Waggled in her head

At times I had to smile  
In front of everyone  
We seemed the best of friends  
Life had just begun  
When on the roof a tile began to slip  
The house of love caved in and that was it  
  
She was full of tears by nature  
It came to me so clear that she would creep  
Her eyes were stale and spun  
Like marbles in the sun  
She wasn't a princess I told her  
And so I witnessed the slaying of my life  
That lasted half the night  
  
I wasn't Jesus

Our love was seedless  
And incomplete

His bible of romance hides itself away  
In quintessence.  
  
A 15 year old's browse through life,  
Is fine with his quintessence safe and sound in mind,  
Life's an adolescence from time to time  
With us all  
In quintessence.  
  
In the corner with his book and tissue  
All he can do is pretend to miss you,  
Closes his eyes as he sees her body  
Pulls funny faces and that's his hobby.  
On the other hand love ain't a happy word  
On the other hand love ain't a piece of skirt,  
Makes for something special in your football shirt  
In quintessence.

In the cafae  
People waking  
With a cigarette and coffee  
And she sits there with her paper  
Half asleep into a picture  
In the morning  
In the morning  
It's all over  
That's another night of business  
With the punters  
On the corner  
Of estates around the river  
And she adds up all the takings  
Hid behind her wilting paper  
In the morning  
In the morning  
Soaked in bath oil  
Dressed in pink towels  
And a sweater  
Looking out at all the people  
Walking under their umbrellas  
In the morning  
There's a feeling  
Of resentment and expectance  
It's a fear that comes with working  
On the dark streets for a living  
She's attending  
To her wet hair  
At the window in the evening  
Getting ready in a short skirt  
With her stockings around her ankles  
It'?s a flame that gets attention  
In a darkness without light  
And the children need a cuddle  
As she walks into the light  
Of the morning

I'll scramble through windows and pull up the blinds  
In another room I'm still not too sure  
That there's no room for me down here  
I shall be sorry

Said your sister should've grown a moustache  
Said you didn't need to take off your mask

A headache in my head like the thunder  
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim  
I couldn't see or feel the night or nothin'  
I wanted to explain, but oh so clever  
Love was like it was some endeavor  
Then I don't remember who said what, when  
On a stack of paper I placed my pen  
  
And when I woke up in the mornin'  
Beside you in the bed  
My mouth was full of nothin'  
My arms around your head

All up to dropsake  
I hear a slow song  
Close gets the love ones  
Onto the dance floor  
The bells are ringing  
For me and my girl  
Nothing can alter nothing can change  
I'll go to pieces, pieces of eight

Squeeze,Out Of Touch,/s/squeeze/out+of+touch_20129317.html,"You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know it's not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But you're wasting your time  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
I'm so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesn't ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing  
Says she really couldn't tell  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I can't  
  
I won't comb my hair for you anymore  
I won't be in early  
I won't be in late  
I won't be in at all so don't sit in and wait  
  
You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But there's no chance  
Now there's no one else to see  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
I'm so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung

Squeeze,Peyton Place,/s/squeeze/peyton+place_20129166.html,"In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
Her hair hung across her face  
Like a bush hangs across a wall  
She was short with a tidy smile  
I could hear temptation call  
From a fly in her ointment  
To the big feather in her cap  
It's a small world we discover  
I had once worked for her dad  
I was in gear making up stories  
And we laughed at each other's tales  
I watched her lips I wanted to kiss them  
My train of thought went off the rails  
  
In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
In Peyton Place  
I lie awake and hear the sound  
That the angels make  
In Peyton Place  
  
The party was now ending  
So she gave me a lift back home  
Somehow I felt so nervous  
She drove so slowly on the road  
Next thing I knew she was in my arms  
Her hair was all over my face  
I brushed it aside she invited me in  
Now my heart beats in Peyton Place  
  
Her hair hung across her face like  
A bush hangs across a wall

Squeeze,Piccadilly,/s/squeeze/piccadilly_20129140.html,"She's not a picture above somebody's fire  
She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer,  
She waits to get even with me.  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that she'll be late to a worrying mother,  
She meets me in Piccadilly.  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions,  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
She's seen one she fancies her smile is impressing,  
So maybe I'll treat her someday.  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Love's on the lips of all forms of engagements,  
All queuing to see tonight's play.  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
He's happy that she is expecting his baby,  
His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry,  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me,  
My mind took a devious role.  
  
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez,  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired,  
Now captured, your love in my arms.  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry,  
Our secret love made its advance.  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle,  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle.

Take me to your nest of china dolls  
Call me up your closest friend  
Join me in my neighbourhood patrol  
Happy me say happy me  
Chinese whispers bounce from ear to ear  
The night is young I feel so old  
See the stars above the night's so clear  
I used to come home late and lie, lie, lie  
She used to see through that but still I tried  
I couldn't cover up the tracks I'd made  
That's how it used to be but not today  
  
Race around I race around  
Focused on the here and now with you  
Every smile's a valentine  
What harm can a little loving do  
Fall about then fall about  
Drunk on love I can't stand on my feet  
Before I try please take my hand  
I've so many words left I should eat  
  
Tickle me please tickle me  
Laughter climbs the walls above our bed  
This night we have is built on love  
Help me so I do not lose the thread  
  
Swallow me say swallow me  
Happy me say happy me  
Race around I race around  
Fall about then fall about  
Tickle me say tickle me  
Love me do sing love me do

Squeeze,Remember What,/s/squeeze/remember+what_20129305.html,"I can't remember what happened last night  
Was there trouble or was there a fight  
I was out with what was her name  
What I did will I ever do again  
And if I did it then what did I do  
Would you let that happen to you  
I'll give this morning back to my bed  
I can't remember I might be dead  
Cupids arrow sliding through the sky  
See you tomorrow come around tonight  
I can't remember what your kiss is like  
I can't remember if you're black or white  
I wish I could, I wish I would remember what  
I can't remember what happened at all  
  
I found my suit all over the hall  
My telephones looking upside down  
Was there paint all over the town  
Is it sunny and is it July  
Does it matter and if so then why  
I'll give this morning back to my cot  
I can't remember if I've been shot  
  
I can't remember which body is mine  
Is it the left or is it the right  
Maybe I had an excess of drink  
What's this mess I find in the sink  
Ashtrays emptied all over my shoes  
Everytime I this booze  
Can't find time for words on the phone  
I'll leave today to play on its own

Squeeze,Rose I Said,/s/squeeze/rose+i+said_20129197.html,"Yes I cried the moment that her hand slapped my face  
A mouth full of sandwich went all over the place  
She left like a tornado the door of course slammed  
I stood in the kitchen a very confused man  
The thump thump of her foot steps went right up the stairs  
The cat ran for cover to the living room chairs  
But what was the problem what on earth could be wrong  
To deserve a slapped face it all seemed far too strong  
  
Rose I said, heaven knows what we've done  
Rose I said, water flows under the bridge  
Rose I said, heaven knows is this love  
Rose I said, curtains close back to read the script  
  
Up to the bedside where she lay in tears  
The drawers were left half open, her clothes laying near  
A suitcase tipped sideways at the end of the room  
I swallowed my sandwich and picked up her boots  
She turned just like an actress, a glare came my way  
I said what's the matter, what have I done today  
She spat out the name of the girl across the road  
I'll never forget the way she flared her nose  
  
Rose was the girl who some days I'd drive to work  
She worked in the office as an articled clerk  
Sometimes we had lunch in the pub along the street  
There was nothing between us, just good company  
I admit that I liked her but that's all it was  
I stood at the bedside in a state of shock  
She heard it different from a friend she met today  
Who says she saw us kissing down an alleyway  
I felt like two people a Jekyll and a Hyde  
I'd really made my bed to lay in this time  
I picked with my tongue at the bread stuck in my teeth  
There through the window, her house on the street  
I knew I was guilty, I told myself to lie  
It seemed to make no differen

I crossed that line  
That borders friendship  
In this bed of mine  
We slept together  
  
And it felt so wrong  
Now I know forever  
That that friendship has gone  
She wore the night shirt  
  
You would have worn  
If you'd been there  
If I had've tried  
To stop myself acting  
  
Like I chose to do  
Is this the end  
Need we pretend  
I slept with a friend  
  
And hurt you  
  
Hand me your pencil  
Hand me your heart  
I feel like writing where do I start  
We drank together and jumped into bed  
  
I had the pleasure  
Then I lost my friend  
We slept together and the guilt's so strong  
Now I know forever  
  
That that friendship has gone
