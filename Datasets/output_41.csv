And need a place to rest your shoes

If knowing this should make you feel low  
And you're feeling the need for someone to know  
I love to hear your welcome hello

There's so many sights  
Those bright city lights

It's a big, big world  
And you're a big, big girl  
So hury up and don't be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
There's no need in you being alone  
All you've got to do is phone

One stolen moment  
That I can't get off my mind  
Let's end this silent suspicion  
Baby it's time for you to listen to my

Gotta let it out of this cage  
So won't you show me you care  
Ooh baby, won't you share

Spending someone's hard earned pay  
You and me Sunday driving  
Not arriving on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards  
Writing letters on my wall  
You and me burning matches  
Lifting latches on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
You and I have memories  
Longer than the road  
That stretches out ahead  
Two of us wearing raincoats  
Standing solo in the sun  
You and me chasing paper  
Getting nowhere on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
You and I have memories

Or a sun that isn't sunny  
Eat a cookie without milk  
I wouldn't  
And it seems that you can't wear  
Just one shoe you need a pair  
Even if I wore them, Which I don't  
I couldn't  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky  
  
Every kind of game takes two  
I can't play without you  
I guess I better put my ball away now  
Even Bouncing is not as funny  
When you can't annoy your buddy  
I'd fix things  
If I just could figure out how  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky

This much I know is true  
It's lonely on my only  
Without you

Kenny Loggins,Vahevala,/k/kenny+loggins/vahevala_20711511.html,"I'm thinking about when I was a sailor  
Spent my time on the open seas  
When we'd stay off the coast of Jamaica  
I'd secretly steal ashore  
The natives were waiting for  
The boy with the lazy soul  
To sing with the sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Every evening I'd be gone  
Back on board by break of dawn  
  
I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica  
Pretty girls dancin' here and there  
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor  
The captain he don't know  
Where Billy he done go  
But I'm singing with native girls  
The songs of a sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Every night in Jamaica I'd sing with the lady  
And drink with the men till the morning appear  
Healthy sunshine is fresh on my face  
As the songs of the night puts the ring in my ear

He steps into the wind and sadly sighs  
""Why does it always seem to be, there's a cold December wind in front of me?""  
The more he fills his empty evenings  
The less he feels that there's a chance to find  
Something that can bring a peace of mind  
Is there a place where you can go?  
A little something you should know to turn the tide to your favor?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wait a little while to welcome what you're after  
Give it the time to find its way to you  
And soon as you no longer try, you'll turn and find it standing by your side  
Come and get it, when you let it, it'll come to you  
  
When I run short on inspiration, I best recall what I've known all along  
'N I remember sweet September's song, there never really has to be  
A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore  
  
Just forget it and wait a little while, while, while  
Wait a little while, everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - every little thing's gonna come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time

Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
we're walking in the air  
we're dancing in the midnight sky  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in a moonlit sky  
The people far below  
Are sleeping as we fly  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding on the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
(All is a dream)  
  
All across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze  
Open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody  
Down below  
Believes  
Their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in a frozen sky  
We're drifting over ice  
and mountains floating by  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
All is a dream  
  
We're walking in the air

Then don't feel alone anymore.  
When we're together, then you've got a lot,  
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore.  
And it goes on and on, oh, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.  
Winding and swirling and dancing along,  
We pass by the old willow tree  
Where lovers caress as we sing of our song,  
Twisting together when we greet the sea.  
And it goes on and on, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.

Kenny Loggins,When I Was A Child,/k/kenny+loggins/when+i+was+a+child_20826543.html,"When I was a child  
So wild and free  
Sometimes I'd stumbled  
Or fall from a tree  
  
But I didn't worry  
And I didn't care  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
Oh, he was my friend  
When no one could make  
Never too busy  
Oh, he'd find a way  
  
Then off we would rambled  
With the wind in our hair  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
But time has no mercy  
For a growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
I left my heart  
When school days were through  
With visions of freedom  
Oh, when dreams do come true  
  
I've never worried  
And I've never cared  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
One night while traveling  
Word came by phone  
The message was simple  
You're needed at home  
  
So once I did worry  
For once I did care  
I prayed that my daddy would wait for me there  
  
Time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
But time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old

'Cause a word can break a heart  
In a love song.  
They say all the things you feel  
And they make it sound so real  
In a love song.  
It seems that everything they say  
Is said in such a way  
That we believe it's true.  
  
'Cause everybody's needing  
What the singers all are singing  
In a love song.  
  
Each of us know  
There's no guarantee  
We'll ever find love.  
And in the songs that we share  
The heartache is there  
To remind us.  
New love brings a thrill  
And we know it always will  
In a love song.  
  
Happiness can leave  
But it helps if we believe  
In a love song.  
There's a part of you and me  
In every memory  
That tells us who we are.  
  
And everybody's needing  
What the singers all are singing  
In a love song.

I see sadness,

I see pain in your face,

A stranger in my place.

I can see now I was wrong,  
I can see where you might weaken  
  
When I wasn't strong.  
I see memories of a love gone bad  
That time cannot erase,  
But I just can't see a stranger in my place.  
  
No one seems to know you quite like I do,  
No one knows the thigs that make you cry.  
Looking back it seems  
I never showed you,  
  
And now I lay alone and wonder why.  
I can see now  
Where you might grow tired of dreams  
That don't come true,  
  
I can see where I have fallen short  
Of the things I promised you.  
I can see mow through my tear filled eyes no love on your face,

Going back to Alabama

Can turn himself around  
He can pick himself fast, just himself fast  
And start all over again, my friend.  
  
Some days I didn't wanna wake up in the morning  
My family and friends were all down on me  
I tried to tell 'em where I was going  
But they never saw the man I saw in me.  
  
Some folks called me a dreamer  
Other folks left and called me a fool  
All I ever wanted to be was a winner  
'cos I know a winner can never lose.

Goodbye marie - oh goodbye Marie

At least I'll have your memory  
  
Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'  
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool  
  
Three weeks of lovin' - 21 nights of heaven  
I stayed just long enough to be your fool  
  
Goodbye Marie - oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me  
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak

Said to me I'd love to be with you  
I'm not tempted for a moment  
I just think about my woman  
The baby calls me on the phone  
Telling me I need to hurrily home  
Well the hurrying is easy  
Because she's waiting up  
With all the love I need  
  
I prefer the moonlight  
The one right little lady by my side  
That's what I like  
I prefer a late drive down the turn park  
With the moonlight shining so brightly  
Got her by my side  
That's what I'd like  
I prefer the moonlight  
  
I prefer playing quiet song  
She's a mother love her daughter  
Moonlight dances on the water  
The moon is full and so am I  
I look at her and feel like I could cry  
But my tears contain no sorrow  
Because I know  
She'll wake up by my side tomorrow  
  
Morning, noon and night  
When the feeling comes so right  
Somewhere in some sky  
Where the moon is surely shining bright

Inside I was dying to stop you

Kenny Rogers,"Life Is Good, Love Is Better",/k/kenny+rogers/life+is+good+love+is+better_20496512.html,"Life is a hustle, every day struggle  
Pushing your way at the top  
Gotta keep it on track and never look back  
And no, you don't dare stop.  
  
There's someone behind you keeping an eye on you  
Hoping you take a fall, a lady, she's liked to see me more  
But I can't slow down at all.  
  
She says:  
Wow, I need some time alone  
I say: no, we gotta keep pushing on  
She said: life is good, love is better?  
  
My daddy, he always preached to me  
You gotta reach for the sky  
Make rain while the sun is shining  
Boy, don't let it pass you by  
  
Money and power is in your hand  
You can do what you wanna be  
Oh, my baby, she?s got a different philosophy.  
  
She says:  
Now I know my sweet lady must be heaven sent  
I just cover the meaning of what she meant  
I've been working so hard for the good life but I headed all the while  
I've found my hiding treasure, baby, right there in this smile.  
  
I say:  
Wow, seems we've spent time alone  
  
I say:  
Wow, how our love has grown  
She was right all alone

Life is good, love is better?

Kenny Rogers,Living With You,/k/kenny+rogers/living+with+you_20249443.html,"You've been teaching me a lesson  
That I've never learned  
You never make it through a lifetime  
Without being burned  
Everything I ever thought you were  
You turned out to be  
Since you gave your love to me.  
  
When I met you on a Monday  
My life just stood still  
I belong in every moment  
That your love can fill  
Let me be the only heart you can mend  
Turn out the light and take it right to the end  
  
[Chorus]  
Living with you  
In the madness of my mind  
In a world I could not find  
But you knew what to do  
Living with you  
There's a full moon on the rise  
There?s a fire in your eyes  
And I was born to be.  
  
Loving you under my skin  
You?re everything to me  
I could not love you more  
And you know that you are mine  
And that?s what I?m living for  
  
There will never be a question  
Of somebody new  
I could make it through a lifetime  
With someone like you  
Let me be the only heart ?

Kenny Rogers,Love Don't Live Here Anymore,/k/kenny+rogers/love+dont+live+here+anymore_20247779.html,"This is the house that love built  
Memories of you, built in each wall  
One tender seed still haunt my dreams  
Thought I just heard your voice in the hall  
The mirrors reflect all the heartache I feel  
Smiling photographs, don't seem real  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Nothing's been moved, but everything's changed  
Each chair is in place, just my life's rearranged  
The wind cries your name through each window and door  
Love don't live here, love don't live here anymore  
  
The fire alight still glows a pale blue  
The mantle is cruel holding pictures of you  
Your scent lingers there, in the bed that we shared  
The last plant I sent is in bloom  
These rooms are unkind to play tricks on my mind  
I can see how you've lived without me

Love lifted me.

Out of the angry waves

Billows His will obey  
He your savior wants to be  
Be saved today

Chosen their eyes  
There's no way to hide  
Of the love that we had  
  
People in love  
Live everyday  
Knowing each other by heart  
A power of two  
Leading them through  
Like a torch in the dark  
  
Yesterday  
Love seemed so far away  
I never dreamed I could be  
One of those people in love  
  
But I found you  
To give up my love in two  
Only you  
I never dreamed we could be  
Two of those people in love  
  
People in love take care forever  
Knowing someone truly cares  
Love is the key  
Of those who believe  
Of a lifetime to share

They rode like they was Rangers as they came out of the skies  
They had High-Tech horses with beacons in their eyes  
My gun was cocked and ready when I looked into their face  
I seen they just weren't just common buck-a-roos born of the human race  
No, sir, these Cowboys came from space  
Their shootin' irons shot laser light and their spurs was anodized  
Bandanas caked with stardust and their jeans was pressurized  
Well he handed me a halter, said, ""Tighten up the girth.""  
But before I hit the saddle we were miles above the Earth.  
And I mean MILES above the Earth  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
I seen London, Paris, Budapest, Kashmir and Tokyo  
And there ain't no sight like a desert night looking down on Mexico  
To the Moons of Mars and Jupiter, 'round Saturn's rings we rode  
Past the frozen plains of Pluto where even the sunshine's cold  
Man, I do mean COLD  
Then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void  
There was nothing to miss in that emptiness, not even a stray asteroid  
So we picked up the trail of a comet tail, man, you can't even DREAM that far  
And the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar  
Just the strummin' of a distant star  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Well, it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years  
When they got me down, I was safe and sound and it hadn't even popped my ears  
And they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light  
I knew they were the good guys, yes, sir. you got it right  
'Cause their cowboy hats was White  
So I asked 'em as they pulled their reins towards the settin' sun  
I said, ""Before you go, I'd like to know, just where you boys come from?""  
Well they opened up a star chart and said, ""right here where this 'X' is  
It's the biggest place in Outer Space, the planet known as Texas""

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.  
You have made me what I am, and I am yours.  
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you.  
Let me hold you in my arms forever more.  
You have gone and made me such a fool.  
I'm so lost in your love.  
And oh, we belong together,  
Won't you believe in my song?  
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you.  
You have come into my life and made me whole.  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning.  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.  
In my eyes I see no one else but you.  
There's no other love like our love.  
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me.  
I've waited for you so long.  
Lady, your love's the only love I need,  
And beside me is where I want you to be.  
'Cause, my love, there's something I want you to know,  
You're the love of my life, you're my lady.

Kenny Rogers,Prairie Wedding,/k/kenny+rogers/prairie+wedding_20297910.html,"We only knew each other by letter,  
When I met her over the train,  
When the smoke cleared and the dust was still,  
She was standing there speaking my name.  
  
I guarantee she looked like an angel,  
I couldn't think of what I should say,  
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden,  
I believe he felt the selfsame way.  
  
I handed her up on the wagon,  
And I loaded up her trunk behind,  
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair,  
I tried to get a hope on my mind.  
  
You think that you could love me, Mary? ,  
You think we got a chance of a life,  
Do you think that you could love me, Mary?  
Now you are to be my wife.  
  
We finally headed out of the station,  
And drove up my home trail,  
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm,  
I thought my resolution would fail.  
  
Now froze as she stepped through the doorway,  
And I stood there as still as could be,  
I said: ""I know, it ain't much it needs a woman's touch,  
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me.""  
  
Do you think that ...  
  
We had a prairie wedding,  
There was a preacher and a neighbor or two,  
I gave my golden thing, a gold wedding ring,  
And the both of us said, ""I do"".  
  
Now when the sun is going down in the prairie,  
And the golden hair is a flame,  
I say ""do you really love me, Mary?""  
I hold her and I whisper her name.  
  
Do you think that...

Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle

Come from the smallest of things

They were looking in the eyes of the king.

For ever and ever, pretty little baby child.

The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes  
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus  
To the savior before us. Pretty little baby child.

He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green  
  
He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison  
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy  
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen  
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy  
  
Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy  
Stunned and shaken someone said she's not here no more  
She left this house four years today

She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve

She's happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood

Kid Rock,Born Free,/k/kid+rock/born+free_20891342.html,"Fast, on a rough road riding  
High, through the mountains climbing  
Twisting, turning further from my home.  
Young, like a new moon rising  
Fierce, through the rain and lightning  
Wandering out into this great unknown.  
  
And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'  
If I don't survive  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born free  
I was born free  
I was born free  
Born Free  
  
Free, like a river raging  
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.  
Chasing dreams and racing father time.  
Deep like the grandest canyon,  
Wild like an untamed stallion.  
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.  
  
You can knock me down and watch me bleed  
But you can't keep no chains on me.

And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down  
Deep into my eyes.  
  
I was born free!

Oh hoo  
  
Calm facing danger  
Lost, like an unknown stranger  
Grateful for my time with no regrets.  
  
Close to my destination  
Tired, frail and aching  
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set  
  
And when its done believe that  
I will yell it from that mountain high

And I will vow to the shining seas  
And celebrate God's Grace on me.

And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
You know I've traveled on yachts thru the south of France  
Think I even got a pair of Versace pants  
But all that makes me feel is like a fool  
Cuz a pontoon boat, and a bottle of Beam  
A couple good friends, and some cut off jeans  
Has made us realize, you can't buy cool  
  
And the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine  
And there's no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
Flyin' high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin' high  
And my family near  
Nowhere to go no place I'd rather be  
Yeah they mock me because I stand out  
But I ain't never had to take a handout  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high.

It goes, 1 for the trebble, and 2 for the bass  
  
And the blue eyed devils gonna rock this place  
'Cause I don't give a damn what ya label me  
I'm still able G, to wreck the whole town  
Got my cards on the table, it's a Royal Flush  
  
In God I trust, and it's a must I bust  
The angel dust and the strick 9  
A big bag of shrooms and the Boones wine  
Never uptight, see I'm that light that shines  
  
Lady's always askin me ""what's your sign""  
I'm a Capricorn, not a Taurus  
I'm the oriental lick master from the forest  
I'm the Borris, sorest, looser that you ever saw  
  
But watch out slick, I'm quick on the draw  
And I'll be blastin the fools like this  
Pop, pop, pop, shit!  
Rocks no joke, I go straight for the throat  
  
Chillin it late on my old mans boat  
I hate to grin about the girls I got  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7 yo I got a whole lot  
Stright pimpin, can't stop this  
  
So when I get low on dough, I make my hoe's dance topless  
Watch me rock this, I'm far from spotless  
I'm really kinda dirty, flippin you the birdy  
Rollin on chrom D's  
  
Bumpin them motherfuckin Beasties  
I see these emcee's laugh at Rock  
But I'm nuclear  
Feel the wrath of the after shock  
  
'Cause after Rock, rocks the spot, I leave the whole crowd hot  
On the mic with my nuts in my hand  
With the sluts backstage, hittin nuts on demand  
That could never be a buster, a straight hustler  
  
I got a good bitch, but I still don't trust her

I gave an invitation to the president, just for kicks  
It said ""your courduly invited to suck my dick""  
I'm a trippin, true as this  
I got mill in the bank, cause I make so much sense  
  
Hell bent, and I'm whisky bound  
Is there anything wacker than the wicked clown (no)  
Some people just don't get it  
They got no talent so they hide behind the gilnick and rcok with it  
  
It's a shame, but who's to blame.  
I got a see note brain, steel veins  
I got love for everyone  
Just don't get dumb, cause if ya get dumb,ya get done  
  
From the jimmy to the beach, to the bum  
From the fist, to the back, to attack with the hand granades  
You can't fade me, I'm down for mine  
And the hate in the world, is the sign of the times

Got the lady's breakin' with this goatee  
24 on a 12 step relapse  
Phil and Bill bozin' at the knee caps  
  
I'll be back if I don't make green  
With the funky rhymes and the no sell out themes  
I have dreams and aspirations  
My graduation, was from pimp of the county to pimp of the nation

Where I can rest my aching soul

Truck jacked up with the four gold shocks  
And where I come from mud flaps come stock  
  
People Kid Rock it up and down the block  
And the hens all flock to the coup with the cock  
You want to rock with me baby, row it down to the swamp  
Dock your boat, we'll do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it, hi-ho  
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho, haha  
  
I like stuckies, truckers and big mesh hats  
I like large round women in laundromats  
I like to wander jack like a backwards thug  
And watch the moonshine through the bottom of a jug  
  
Hugging and kissing with my vision all blurry  
Sifting through this world of worry  
Hurry up with love, please, God bless  
I don't do drugs anymore or any less  
  
I didn't start this mess on this planet  
Stop looking at me like a bandit  
I've been chilling down at the swamp  
With the folks that want to do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it, hi-ho  
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho  
  
Now people want to know how to do this dance  
Life your legs in the air like you wet your pants  
Plant your hands on the top of your butt  
And stomp around the woods like you're all fucked up  
  
Circle up the trucks, fire up the brush  
Untuck your shirt, we're gonna kick some dust  
Don't two plus two it or three plus three it  
Four by four and to a place that's scenic  
  
Heat it up like some hot ham hocks cooking  
And hop to the spot where the cops ain't looking

I swing low like a chimp, back in '86  
Then I was seein' a shrink  
But now I'm humble and I can only think  
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp  
  
So ask no questions and I tell no lies

You can bid all day, but I can't be bought  
  
Uh, break it up, let's tie one on  
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn  
So I grab my Walkman but before I cut  
I go behind the garage and fire it up

From a low so high  
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by  
These thoughts I have, I can't mold the sense  
  
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense  
Born and raised in the outer lands  
And at times you could say I'm out of hand  
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run  
  
Every time that paper hits my tongue  
And sometimes it seems so odd  
When my veins are poppin' and I'm on the nod  
I am the Bullgod, you understand?  
And here in my hand is my master plan  
  
I'm gonna get you

They come and they go  
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know  
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep  
  
Someone so shallow that's in so deep  
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared  
Completely blinded but things are so clear  
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother  
  
I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father  
Fuckin' A is all I got to say  
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way  
I was born into this world and I don't know why  
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die

Get all stoned and play some Hank  
I guess that's just the way I am  
And I love the man from Galilee  
Because he died for you and me  
I met them both in Dixieland

Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
[Verse 2]  
When the water all turned into wine  
I lost my mind for a time  
I felt them both holding my hand  
Looking through these bloodshot eyes  
Praise The Lord I saw the light  
And two sets of footprints in the sand

Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
I was cashing in, I was casting stones  
I was lost in sin I was on my own  
But now I don't feel alone  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life

They say that every man bleeds just like me

I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time  
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain  
I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same

A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a crowd

I will always be around

And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around

I've been gone, I've been gone way too long  
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss

Kid Rock,Say Goodbye,/k/kid+rock/say+goodbye_21095881.html,"[Verse 1]  
We haven't really talked about it  
All we do is walk around it now  
I hate to say I thought about it  
I wished that we could make this work somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not really complicated  
I can hear it when you sigh  
It comes a time we have to face it  
Maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lately I can feel us drifting  
Even tho the good outweighs the bad  
It feels like our world is shifting  
And yet, you are the best I've ever had  
  
[Chorus]  
I still love to watch you sleeping  
I still see that look in your eyes  
But they're seein' and believin'  
That maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Bridge]  
Say goodbye to all the times we treasured  
Say goodbye, let the chips fall where they lay  
Say goodbye, to things we cannot measure  
Walk away, say goodbye!  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'll remember you forever  
I'll remember every single year  
Runnin' through the rain and laughin'  
And later in our bed we feel so near  
And I'll know when I am older  
And the clouds fill up the sky  
I may look over my shoulder  
And no-one was too young to say goodbye  
Years from now when I am older  
I may sit and wonder why  
Will I look over my shoulder?  
And know I was too young to say goodbye  
I was just too young to say goodbye  
To say goodbye!

Tellin' him stories  
About the things that we did  
When we were a family  
  
Long time ago  
I've answerd his questions  
'Til I'm blue in the face  
Wish all that hurt in him  
  
I could erase  
But I tell him the truth  
Cause he ain't to young to know

Part time mother  
When I'm not one  
Then I'm the other  
You used to be  
My full time lover  
Now I'm a single father  
And a part time mother  
I spend every minute  
I can with my boy  
There's no doubt about it  
He's my pride and joy  
  
Someday he will grow up  
And I won't have him no more  
Some things I just find  
Too hard to explain  
  
So we go to mcdonalds  
Or I buy him a train  
And we go put it together  
On the living room floor  
  
Such is the life  
Of a single father  
He says daddy explain  
If it's not too much bother  
  
While its just you and me  
Living here in this home  
I don't understand it  
And neither does he  
  
Why there's just two  
When there should be three of us  
Sharing this moment  
Lord I feel so alone

There's a rising in the air  
Somewhere somebody's tryin' to tell me they care  
So I'm a lift my head to a new day  
Plant my feet on the ground  
Look at life in a new way and what's goin' down  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try and change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And slow my roll  
Mixin' loneliness and whiskey  
Heartache and cocaine  
Livin' life like a gypsy, lost and ashamed  
So I'm a look to the Lord as my witness  
Rest my hat on a shelf  
Trade these boots for forgiveness and find myself  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try to change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, 'cause they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And I can't believe sixteen has long since past  
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', and never looking back  
And I won't survive if I live this life this fast, no, no  
And today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down

I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang

Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour

Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror  
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt  
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt  
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my roap  
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because

But comprehendible  
I'm the presentable good lookin  
  
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin  
Heatin' the house up just like a hot late  
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate  
You didn't think in a blink I'd stnd here  
  
Now your in fear and stand clear  
You can't come near this hot sylin  
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin  
Aso the perfect lyric announcer  
  
On the set with a cold forty ouncer  
Ready to glide from sid to side  
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride

'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

But before I'm threw  
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe

Close to an angel  
But I wear no Halo  
I just shake, create, and never act fake  
  
And I learned to dislike and not hate  
Because hatred leads to an uproar  
Violence is on thing I am not here for  
I'm just here flat out  
  
And to blow the roof  
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do  
Pump it up like an air comb presser  
Teach to each like a wise professor  
  
No job I strive to reach high  
Make the girls in the house all sigh  
And I'll glide from side to side

'Cause they dream ofme to rock the place  
And put a big smile upon their face

But they have to like the bass  
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on te set  
Workin up a sweat

Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel  
Just heal  
  
And always look for the seal that's real  
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this  
Kid Rock serious and I mean business  
Ascending up and up I keep boosting  
  
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston  
With a mind of violence, right, I might  
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's  
To release to each and be friends of  
Every single, individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin'  
Come together

I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'  
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority  
'Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me  
  
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'  
A lotta just came in, sound the same in  
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men  
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan

No half steppin', I always take a full stride  
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made  
I used to come correct in the projects  
  
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement  
House and parties like real estate agent

Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears  
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot  
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot  
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war  
  
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out  
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out  
New tax the acts and half the drug industry  
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me  
  
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up  
For one to get over, one must get stuck up  
One will roll up, another will smoke up  
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up  
  
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there  
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air  
'Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin for a hooker  
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her  
  
For a place to hide and when he got his ride  
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died  
Her family cried over this homicide  
And why they pondered, why she wandered  
  
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop  
All to smoke a little cooked up rock  
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along  
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
  
From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein  
Maybe I'm ahead of my time  
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states  
Surrounded by the Great Lakes  
  
I was once out cold at 15 years old  
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo  
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats  
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks  
  
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes  
But now I realize it wasn't too wise  
So now I teach, I'll reach to each  
And every single individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin

Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh  
Here's a new jam for you to cling to  
A funky rhythm that you can swing to  
  
Kid Rock that's me  
And the party jumpin is what I'm for seeing  
So just chill or I'll boot you  
Get on me and I'll shoot you  
  
I'm fresh to that there's no guessin  
Rock the mic without any fessin  
With your blessin  
I will get stupid, you didn't know it  
  
I thought you knew it  
I'm the kid that comes exactin  
With my ace the black man  
Two b-boys from the Midwest  
  
Rock the shows 'Cause were professionals  
On the set night and day while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
The bass drops and works its hardest  
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist  
Clockin' paper 'cause I got soul  
Comin' at you from the Motor capital  
  
Shakin' booties  
Not all the cuties  
I'm too cool to be a little fruity  
Drinkin' forties every weekend  
  
I'm the master who's always speakin  
To some freak and if I freak her  
Its at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper  
But off that topic got to get it  
  
Super dope, extremely poetic  
The K-I-D-are-O-see-Kin  
I love girls that's how its layin  
With these jammies  
  
Fuck the grammies  
All I care about is shaking fannies  
And I have been doin it for a long time  
But now I'm nineteen  
  
And in my prime  
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
On the mico is solo  
'cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos  
Only rappin 'cause I don't sing dope  
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo  
  
Lace up the Reebox  
Comb the high top  
Black dose with a little hip hop  
And I style it with some uniqueness  
  
You say I'm not fresh  
But I could careless  
When I rock the mic  
I'm your girl is likin  
  
? women are not lookin  
Create a beat that is fully hookin  
'Cause when I get dumb  
People ave fun  
  
? sisco hand me the magnum  
In a hell of a show I always display  
While the girls say  
The Upside Down  
  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round

Kid Rock,Times Like These,/k/kid+rock/times+like+these_20917831.html,"The lakes and pines they bleed of beauty and grace  
And the rivers they run wild like an endless race  
The forests soar so high then fall to the sea  
As church bells ring and sing in harmony  
  
I heard them say they're shuttin' Detroit down  
But I won't leave 'cause this is my hometown  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The concrete and steel stand strong against the wind  
With the memories of what was and what has been  
The sounds of sweet soul music and blue-collar blues  
There were seventeen colors for a Chevy all red white and blue  
  
I heard them say that you can't save that town  
But I won't leave, I will stand my ground  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The ice and snow give way to a new spring bloom  
In the wake that hope and faith they will be home soon  
A new day dawns as the good Lord shines from above  
'Cause in the rubble and rust there remains a whole lotta love  
  
And I was here watchin' it all go down  
And I'll still be, when it comes back around  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
It makes us who we are in times like these

Kid Rock,Trippin' Over A Rock,/k/kid+rock/trippin+over+a+rock_20078175.html,"People like the way my style is rollin'  
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin'  
I'm not bullshittin'  
Here's how I'm hittin'  
  
Funkin' it up more than George Clinton  
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format  
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that  
I live press the best I won't rest the pest(?)  
  
'Cause I'm blessed and I jus won't settle for less  
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up  
The one with the hair that stands straight up  
People look and stare in shock  
  
Trippin' over a Rock  
Trippin' over a Rock  
  
Chased,and chased and chased but never close to caught  
And the skills I filled were all self taught  
With so many styles on each panfulls(?)  
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels  
  
As the girls admire the way I aspire  
To move piles of dough in my own empire  
Not a liar, I tell no lies  
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes  
  
But don't get me wrong I get wicked  
Shake that ass in my face and ill stick it  
Hit it get wit it  
Knock it out the box  
  
Trippin' over a rock  
Trippin' over a rock  
  
A genuine badman  
Like Yosemite Sam man  
I see-see-see-can rock the land  
And bring a new swing and sensation  
  
To represent the next generation  
So slack up You better back up  
Here comes the score and the weed in a jigsaw  
Fuck with me  
  
With no doubt  
Ill put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out  
Ill go deep in I won't weaken  
Guaranteed to keep the house beepin'  
  
Girls rockin' guys  
Try to to cockblock(?)

Kid Rock,U Don't Know Me,/k/kid+rock/u+dont+know+me_20078210.html,"Here here we go from Japan to Romeo  
My flow is slow and it's ya know my first time on radio  
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild  
And that all might be true  
  
But it did not happen overnight  
So let me tell my tale to you  
It started out when I was six just tellin' dirty jokes  
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap  
  
Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do  
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth  
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not  
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block  
  
You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin it's tail  
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail  
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak  
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week  
  
So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all  
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standin tall...  
And you don't know me  
It's funny how one kid can cause so much confusion  
  
Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using  
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory  
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story  
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at  
  
Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back  
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style  
They try to diss they shoot they miss  
I walk off with a smile  
  
But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me  
And the booty naked truth is you don't know shit about me  
So when I'm in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me  
So you can see what's really me and find out you don't know me  
  
'cause you don't know me  
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam  
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam  
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty  
  
With every drind 'n every blink you seem to get more pretty  
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do  
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to  
(Ha!)  
  
Next day I awoke I almost choked  
Who's bringin me inside,  
My head was ringin' heard people singin' ""here comes the bride""  
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see  
  
The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me  
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony  
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN'  
You don't know me...She didn't know me  
  
Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist  
But they bought my first L.P.  
You know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast  
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie  
  
What's your favorite song off that L.P.  
""Ah, Wax that Booty""  
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny  
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money  
  
But check on back 'cause it's a fact obscenity is no new thing  
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling  
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel  
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real  
  
Even though I don't look the same 'cause I cut off my flat top  
I'll always say just what I feel 'cause that's the real Kid Rock...  
And you don't know me.

Smack all the hoes  
Show love to those who come real with it  
  
Life's a bitch but I deal with it  
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman  
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins  
I'm not born again

Well I'm puffin' a Winston  
Drinkin' a four-o  
Kid rock, and I'ma let you know

I've been sitting here just wasting time  
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind  
  
Its been a couple of months in this smokey room  
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes  
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit  
  
A little bit of love that's all I need  
A little inspiration and a bag of weed  
A seed to plant so my tree can grow  
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooold up  
  
Wait a minute I'm about to flow  
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know

I ain't no rough guy  
Ain't no tough guy  
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly  
Born in the game that's all I am  
  
Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam  
Fuck it  
I'm free to do what I please little lady  
I was born at night but not last night baby  
  
I've been around - seen some things  
I slept in dumpsters - got high with kings  
I don't bring much - ain't gotta lot to say  
But I got more time than Morris day  
  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm a let you know

I tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet  
The light that shines will redefine your old beliefs  
What you reap is what you sow and so it goes  
Where you plant your needs is where your garden grows  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else, it will make you feel  
  
Each day ain't wine and roses  
I doubt it's meant to be  
Always a cross to bear salvation don't come free  
A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds  
And you know that's true  
So don't deny yourself of something good for you  
Before you do it for yourself, do it for someone else  
That makes it real  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause when you love someone  
It don't matter what you say  
When you love someone  
You will dance the night away  
When you love someone  
There ain't nothing you can't do  
Ain't that right  
Yeah I want to love someone tonight  
  
Will you believe in love or just sit around and judge?  
Can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge?  
'Cause above selfishness there lies a bright blue sky  
And wealth and happiness can be a long and lonesome ride  
Yes it's hard to steer yourself  
Without that someone else to take the wheel  
Take the wheel

Do you believe in the art of growing old  
Do you believe that rock n roll can save your soul  
Do you believe in everything you do  
'Cause when you do that's when it all comes back to you  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else  
Do it for yourself

Some kind of slick chrome American prince  
A blue jean serenade  
And Moon River what'd you do to me  
And I don't believe you  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the minute that I turn away  
I got my money on a pond tonight  
  
Change came in disguised of revelation  
Set his soul on fire  
She said she'd always knew he'd come around  
And the decades disappear like sinking  
Ships we persevere god gives us hope  
But we still fear  
When we don't know  
The mind is poison castle in the sky  
Sit stranded vandalized  
The draw bridge is closing  
  
Saw Cinderella in a party dress but  
She was looking for a night gown  
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands  
He's getting ready for the show down  
I saw the ending were they turned the page  
I threw my money and I ran away  
Straight to the Valley of the great divide  
  
And were the dreams roll high  
And were the wind don't blow  
Out here the good girls die  
And the sky won't snow  
Out here the bird don't sing  
Out here the field don't grow  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the bell don't ring  
Out here the good girls die  
  
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep  
Its such a bitter form of refuge  
Ah don't you know the kingdoms under siege  
And everybody needs you  
Is there still magic in the midnight sun  
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one  
In the of the cadence in the young mans eyes  
And were the dreams roll high

Laughing with your girlfriends

There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface  
Just walkin' through the front door makes me nervous  
It's creepin' up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand  
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand

Flailin' in the corner  
Here's the towel  
Go on, throw it in

Somewhere outside that finish line  
I square up and break through the chains  
And I hit like a raging bull  
Anointed by the blood, I take the reins  
Cut from the cloth, of a flag that  
Bears the name of ""Battle Born""  
They'll call me the contender  
They'll listen for the bell  
With my face flashing crimson from the fires of hell  
  
(What are you afraid of?)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time,  
(Flesh and bone)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
Man, I'm turning on a dime,  
(Flesh and bone)  
  
(This could decay)  
This could decay  
Like the valley below  
Defenses are down  
The stakes are high (scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)  
The fairytale end (to face off the journey that fathers no more)  
The staggering blow (you'll find the truth in the roots of desire)  
You lead with your chin(thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the
sun)  
This could be real(thinkin' with your corners, just a)  
Simple  
  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time  
(Flesh and bone)  
What are you made of?  
  
He faces forward,  
Trading in his blindness for the world of love,  
And time is raging, may it rage in vain,  
And you always had it, but you never knew,  
So boots and saddles, get on your feet,  
There's no surrender, cause there's no retreat,  
The bells are sounding, bring this match to an end,  
We are the descendants of giant men

There's bodies decomposing in containers tonight  
In an abandoned building where  
Squatters made a mural of a Mexican girl  
With fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl  
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world  
Four winds blowing through her hair  
  
But when great Satan's gone... the Whore of Babylon...  
She just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed  
She caves, She caves  
  
The Bible's blind, the Torah's deaf, the Qur'an's mute  
If you burned them all together you'd get close to the truth still  
They're pouring over Sanskrit on the Ivy League moons  
While shadows lengthen in the sun  
Cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times  
And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds  
It's knocking over fences crossing property lines  
Four Winds, cry until it comes  
  
And it's the Sum of Man slouching towards Bethlehem  
A heart just can't contain all of that empty space  
It breaks. It breaks. It breaks.  
  
Well I went back by rented Cadillac and company jet  
Like a newly orphaned refugee retracing my steps  
All the way to Cassadaga to commune with the dead  
They said, ""You'd better look alive""  
And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps  
In the Black Hills, the Badlands, the calloused East  
I buried my ballast. I made my peace.

A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road,  
But I still don't know where to start  
  
She wrote her number down  
And she gave it to me  
They had to scrape me off the floor  
In this transient town, waiters and dealers  
Trying to get their foot in the door  
  
That night I called her and she said  
""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in the world""  
And I said to her  
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""  
  
I can see the time drippin' down the clock,  
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain  
It's the one that knows just when our heads are down  
And reminds us of the place from where we came  
Where we came  
  
""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in this world""  
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""  
  
What happened here, what is this world?  
It's too far from the heart of a girl  
A ripple in the water  
From the drop of a pearl  
I'm on the shore waitin'  
For the heart of a girl  
  
Many doors, knock on one  
Standin' still, time is raging  
Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns  
And you're still here, you're still here  
  
I believe that we never have to be alone  
Yes I believe it's just around the bend  
You can hold it in  
Or you can scream it on a microphone  
There is no end (there is no end)  
There is no end (there is no end)  
  
And, deep in the night, I feel the presence  
Of something that was long ago told to me  
There is a hand, guiding the river  
The river to wide open sea  
And deep in my heart, in and again  
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid  
Standing on stone, you stand beside me  
And honor the plans that were made

Kim Wilde,Hold On,/k/kim+wilde/hold+on_20078489.html,"In the day I can smile though I want to die  
I hold on, hold on  
I can keep it together for a little while  
And be strong, so strong  
But when the sun goes down and I'm all alone  
I haven't the strength to fight  
That's when my tears give into the night  
Tell me how, How much loneliness can one heart take  
Without the chance that it will break in two  
And why I'm holding on to a love that has gone  
Tell me how to carry on  
  
I believed that meeting you would be my destiny  
Your love would come to set me free  
So why am I left standing here alone  
Won't you please come and take me home  
  
Tears give into the night  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night  
I can keep it together for a little while  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night

Kim Wilde,Hypnotise,/k/kim+wilde/hypnotise_20223345.html,"I can't help it when you're near me  
I don't think straight, I get all confused  
I just lose all my concentration  
With no question at all I'd surrender to you  
Standing here so close together  
I can feel all the magic again  
But I'm holding back the emotion  
Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain  
I know I should take it slow but,  
The minute I see you I just let go  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It's a gamble, can we take it  
Playing safe is no way to survive  
There's a chance for us, we can make it  
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive  
Admit that we made mistakes but  
I know in my heart that it's not too late  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again  
And I'm trying not to let it show  
But the minute I see you I just let go  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control

Kim Wilde,I Believe My Own Eyes,/k/kim+wilde/i+believe+my+own+eyes_20078492.html,"As performed in the musical ""tommy""  
With alistair robins as mr. walker  
Written by pete townsend  
  
Alistair: this can't continue  
It makes no sense  
We're getting nowhere  
I've lost all my confidence  
The boy wants something  
Unsatisfied  
He needs attention  
And care our love can't provide  
  
And then, there's the matter of us  
  
I'd like to prove  
That I don't think you've seen the best of me  
I've stood up for the boy  
And I've clung to the hopes and the lies  
  
I wished that the pain in your gaze  
Could again be a test of me  
But when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
Kim: I'd like to declare  
This devotion and care is a life to live  
That nothing has changed  
And the time isn't passing us by  
But I have to say here  
That for us there is a clear-cut alternative  
When we look at eachother  
We believe our own eyes  
  
Both: I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
This has gone far enough  
After all we've been through  
We can be brave  
We done all we can humanly do  
It's a time to be tough  
A time to be wise  
We must stop chasing our dreams and recover our lives  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe...  
  
I'd like to believe  
But I don't think that we've seen the best of us  
And a way to believe is to see where the real future lies  
I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of me  
And when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
Let's believe our own eyes  
No we've come to the end  
All our patience is gone  
Let's admit we intend to believe our own eyes  
  
Kim: ... to believe our own eyes

Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright lights the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
Hot-shot, give me no problems.  
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind.  
You know life is cruel, life is never kind.  
  
Kind hearts don't make a new story.  
Kind hearts don't grab any glory.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Come closer, honey that's better.  
Got to get a brand new experience.  
Feeling right.  
Oh don't try to stop baby.  
Hold me tight.  
  
Outside a new day is dawning.  
Outside Suburbia's sprawling everywhere.

Here it comes now, Sunday morning  
Just another sleepy town yawning  
Down below everything looks just like another day  
But, in the warm glow of the sunrise  
There's a child who's searching with young eyes  
Looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away  
There was one time I was leaving  
But the folks around me kept grieving  
Friends said go, but my dad said no  
And my mum kept saying  
""Don't go, don't go away  
Don't leave us, you've got to stay  
Just raise them kids, oh mother no""  
  
No prospects, just projects  
Don't try to tell me we're living  
There's no real need to try  
Can't you see this town gonna die  
  
Hail the new age, it's a rat cage  
Join the place for breeding dumb spieces  
All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to  
Burn the place down, make it dead ground  
Show the people just what they're missing  
Wake up, wake up, can't you believe in what I'm telling you  
There's a house where I was born in  
Now it's changed without any warning  
Cranes just crash and bricks just smash  
While a billboard's saying  
""Let's go, let's get away  
Come fly me, you've weeks to pay  
When sunshine calls, but I won't go  
  
This is our town

In time you'll see  
It has to be this way  
And though it hurts to say  
I'm gonna be staying with my baby

And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes, before you turn away  
You must know that I'll always love you  
But now, I'm staying with my baby  
  
You used to say  
I should maybe take it further  
And leave one day  
My family - but I'm responsible for them  
They depend on me  
So now you see, our love is history  
I'm sad it has to end  
But I'm gonna be staying with my baby

He's just a desperate man  
Who's doing all he can  
So I'm going back

I saw a man digging in the ground  
Working the late shift, it was the gravedigger  
Jeremiah had worked here for years  
Already had one foot in the grave  
With my help we got in the other  
I can't believe, he wasn't stronger  
  
Mary the hooker was coming to church  
To let the reverend fill up her purse  
Jesse Bell, may his soul rest in hell  
No one must find out, no one must tell  
  
Heads on the wall, I'm looking at  
Heads on the wall, dead yet alive

And they're staring at me, and me, and me

And when you eat.  
But you can't break the pattern, week after week.  
The bruises show,  
But he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go.  
You'll never let us know  
Exactly how you feel.  
What's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse,  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.  
You say it's okay,  
But I say that it's not right.  
You wind him up, but you're living in fear,  
You keep going back but it ends in tears, oh.  
  
That's quite a cut on the side of your head.  
Is it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed?  
Oh, so uncouth,  
Excuse me, is this your tooth?  
Why do you stay, no one knows.  
Do you really love him, or are you too scared to go?  
You're always nervous and on the edge of tears.  
You cry alone,  
But you never tell us what it's like when you get back home.  
No one will ever know  
Because you never show.  
What's the use,  
Everyone says you've got no excuse,  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.  
You say it's okay,  
But I say that it's not right.  
Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?  
It takes two sides to know it's true,  
And maybe, he'll stay in love with you.  
No one will ever know,  
Because you never show.

The first night I've missed for a couple of years,  
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,  
And just when I wanted no one to be there,  
All of my friends were there.  
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,  
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.  
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.

Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.  
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,  
And gave the impression that I did not care,  
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the despair.  
Came the day, helped with a few last glasses of gin,  
I nervously mounted the stage once again,  
Got through my performance and no one complained,  
Thank God I can go back to normal again.

Where I had been in much happier days,

Kinks,Celluloid Heroes,/k/kinks/celluloid+heroes_20079243.html,"Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are  
There are stars in every city  
In every house and on every street  
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete  
  
Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne  
But she turned her back on stardom  
Because she wanted to be alone  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive  
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by  
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi  
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite  
But stand close by Bette Davis  
Because her's was such a lonely life  
  
If you covered him with garbage  
George Sanders would still have style  
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney  
He would still turn round and smile  
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn  
Cause she's not very tough  
She should have been made of iron or steel  
But she was only made of flesh and blood  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are  
And those who are successful  
Be always on your guard  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along Hollywood Boulevard  
  
I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk along...  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
La la la la...  
  
Oh, celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
Oh, celluloid heroes never really die  
I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show

Where the supermarket used to stand.  
Before that they put up a bowling alley  
On the site that used to be the local palais.  
That's where the big bands used to come and play.  
My sister went there on a Saturday.  
Come dancing,  
All her boyfriends used to come and call.  
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?  
  
Another Saturday, another date.  
She would be ready but she'd always make him wait.  
In the hallway, in anticipation,  
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.  
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week  
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.  
Come dancing,  
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,  
And when they said come dancing,  
My sister always did.  
  
My sister should have come in at midnight,  
And my mum would always sit up and wait.  
It always ended up in a big row  
When my sister used to get her own way  
Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight,  
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.  
  
The day they knocked down the palais  
My sister stood and cried.  
The day they knocked down the palais  
Part of my childhood died, just died.  
  
Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,  
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.  
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.  
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.  
She knows they get away with things she never could,  
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,  
Come dancing,  
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.  
Don't be afraid to come dancing,  
It's only natural.  
  
Come dancing,  
Just like the palais on a Saturday.  
And all her friends will come dancing  
Where the big bands used to play.

Cut out the struggle and strife,

I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.  
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket  
It has honor, it has character and it's British.  
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments  
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.  
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all  
And come to God's call with bat and ball.  
  
Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,  
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.  
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket  
And you know that that's not cricket.  
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin  
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.  
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.  
  
All through your life he'll try to bowl you out  
Beware the Demon bowler.  
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,  
And bowl a maiden over.  
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous  
And remember that God is on your side.  
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

Kinks,Heart Of Gold,/k/kinks/heart+of+gold_20079141.html,"Growing up isn't easy to do,

The apple of your father's eye,  
And always by your brother's side.  
Then a little sister came along,

I guess she's reached that difficult age.  
  
Growing up is very hard to do,  
Everyone watching your every move.  
Your private life always on view,  
But jealously never really suited you.  
But I know that  
  
Underneath that rude exterior,  
There's got to be a heart of gold.  
Underneath that hard exterior,  
Is a little girl waiting to be told,  
You've got a heart of gold.  
She's got a heart of gold.

I only wanted to take a photograph of you,  
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say.  
You picked up my camera, threw it away,  
I didn't really mean to ruin your day.  
  
Now I see you've got a little girl of your own.  
Little princess certainly grown,  
And there's a man, he's smiling at you.  
He must have been the one who always knew.

Will I be a working man?

Soap operas full of vanity  
So much wealth and property  
Side by side with petty crime

Commercials full of luxuries  
A man has one, a cat has nine

Too soon to tell

Why can't life be more sublime

So you unplug all the phones, jus want to be left alone  
Praying for a better day.

Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  
  
See people always talk about bout  
The things that they've been going through  
But you can't tell how me I feel feel  
Until you walk in my shoes  
See I'm tired of being tired  
Fake people all around  
Want someone to love me for me (me)

Will you be there (In a hurry)

And so called best friend, you're not around

You were always there

So wit my knees I hit the floor  
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus

And all the things I wish I had

Weeping, enduring for night  
But joy comes in the morning light

Ain't nobody taking this joy away

Kirk Franklin,How It Used To Be,/k/kirk+franklin/how+it+used+to+be_20709418.html,"I ain't gonna lie  
I can't even count the days  
Or the many nights I tried living here alone  
A heart full of pride  
Couldn't see the enemy was me  
I was blind and thought my second chance was gone  
A ship without a sail  
Battered by the raging sea  
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain  
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees  
I know it's been a long time  
Do you still remember my name?  
  
Can I go back in time?  
Can I have another try?  
But I can't change yesterday  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I  
Can't take another day without you  
Cause this heart don't beat the same without you  
I forgot who I was  
Got caught up in this world  
Jesus I apologize  
I should've lost my mind without you  
Not another sleepless night without you Jesus  
I'm sorry and I'm asking please  
Make us how we used to be  
  
I try and try to keep my mind on you  
But trouble keeps calling me  
Every time a wound heals  
Something else takes the healing away  
But even when I've gone too far  
You don't even call my name  
Mama said if you love let it go  
And if it comes back then it's back to stay  
You already knew I belong to only you  
I run to your arms and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never knew a life so cold  
Thought that things could fulfill my soul  
Tried to find love on my own  
It was hard to admit I was wrong  
No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken  
  
Now we've come to the break  
Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)  
I know (I know)  
I give my life right  
But you know  
You ain't promised tonight  
Babygirl  
Without you  
(I can't breathe)  
Without you  
(I can't exist)  
Without you  
(This world ain't got nothing for me  
I'm coming home)

I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me

I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse  
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse

I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures  
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures  
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets  
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set  
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,  
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth  
Animosity within the ministers of our church  
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary  
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary  
As for statistics

And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it

No one to say I love you and you feel all your hope is gone  
Try to call your best friend but he's not there  
So you wind up feeling empty like no one cares  
  
My brother don't you worry storms don't last always  
There's a man from glory full of mercy and grace  
  
Keep your head up smile again  
keep your head up smile again

You can go on and shout and praise Him right now

And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You

Never been north of the wise old Thames before  
  
Muslims and Christians, lions and tigers,  
Bombers and fighters  
Harder than they've seen before  
  
Any god that we've needed in time  
Stormed out the door and he slammed it shut behind  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die I'll die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing

My Legionnaire of today took all the food and he ran away just laughing  
'It's never too late', he said  
Out of his head as he walked towards the sun  
  
Round him........... ?  
Slumped into the ground, a cross upon his back  
Then we decided, heaven's a stranger away in a manger  
Never too big for the sack?  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die I'll die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing

Fathered by fools

Compulsory waste in our schools

Nothing could make us fall but that's not true

You may not believe me but it's the hardest thing I've ever done  
My eyes see other glories  
Other dreams and other stories  
And I want to live before I die  
Dear john  
  
Ten years on  
I still dream and we still hesitate  
The passion's all but gone  
Oh dear john  
Seems we have a bad day every day  
I want to sleep my life away  
This is the letter no-one ever wants to read  
And though it hurts like hell  
It may be what you need to tell you  
I never wanted to be cruel  
But I'm so tired of being the strong one  
And I don't always havet he energy  
And you always leave it up to me  
Dear john  
  
My eyes have seen the glory  
There's more to life than my life story  
And I'll probably never find him  
But I have to keep on looking  
And I'm very very sorry dear john

Don't you think it's sad  
What's happened to the water  
Our water's going bad  
Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams  
Have all been touched by man  
Poison flowing out to sea  
Now threatens life on land  
  
Don't go near the water  
Ain't it sad  
What's happened to the water  
It's going bad  
  
Don't go near the water  
Don't go near the water  
  
Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath  
So that's a modern ecological aftermath  
Beginning with me  
Beginning with you  
  
Don't go near the water  
To do it any wrong  
To be cool with the water  
Is the message of this song  
Let's all help the water  
Right away  
Do what we can and ought to  
Let's start today

Kirsty Maccoll,El Paso,/k/kirsty+maccoll/el+paso_20704800.html,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso  
I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Night-time would find me in Rosa's Cantina  
Music would play and Felina would whirl  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in  
Wild as the West Texas wind  
Dancing and daring, a drink he was sharing  
With wicked Falina, the girl that I loved  
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
  
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran  
Out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run  
Up on its back and away I did ride  
Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
I saddled up and away I did go  
Riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso  
I can see Rosa's Cantina below  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys  
Off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's back door  
Something is dreadfully wrong for I fear  
A deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle  
I'm getting weary, unable to ride  
But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle  
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest  
  
From out of nowhere Felina has found me  
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for  
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

And when you asked me out I really was delighted  
So we went to a pub in belsize park  
And we cheered on england as the sky grew dark  
Oh you shouldn't have kissed me cause you started a fire  
But then I found out that you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You never mentioned your three children  
And the fact you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
If you hadn't passed out while I was talking to your friend  
It could have really ended badly cause you very nearly had me  
If he hadn't taken pity on my heart full of desire  
I might never have found out you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You forgot you have three children  
You forgot you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
It is not in my nature to ever pick the winning team  
Sometimes I think I'm happy then I remember it's a dream  
Now it isn't in my nature to ever pick a winner  
I always pick a bastard who would have me for his dinner  
  
I can never possess the object of my desire  
Cause he's bound to turn out to be a serial liar  
Ok I didn't mention my kids, I thought I'd wait a bit  
But I am free and single and he's a lying git

He lied about his life  
He forgot he had three children  
He forgot he had a wife  
And it's england 2 colombia 0  
I know just how those colombians feel  
  
So I got into a taxi and sobbed all the way home  
Called my friend up in sao paulo and cried down the phone  
I played some tragic music and I lay down to die  
But later I woke and I hadn't stopped crying  
  
You should never have kissed me, you tasted of deceit  
Your perfume was adultery but I'm not a piece of meat  
So I'll be the one that you couldn't acquire  
I found out in time you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
And I pity your three children  
And I pity your poor wife  
Now you can go to hell  
I'm going to brazil

In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me, won't see another one  
And then he sang a song  
The rare old mountain dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you  
  
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen to one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you  
So happy Christmas  
I love you baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true  
  
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas eve  
You promised me  
Broadway was waiting for me  
  
You were handsome  
You were pretty  
Queen of new york city  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging,  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
The boys of the nypd choir  
Were singing ""galway bay""  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
You're a bum  
You're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  
You scumbag, you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy christmas your arse  
I pray god it's our last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I could have been someone  
Well so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When i first found you  
I kept them with me babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you

Misunderstandings caused by lack of honesty

Felt so sincere but she was easily impressed  
And every time she had the chance she got undressed

I just woke up  
  
With eyes as cold as ice cream  
Floating in a frozen lake  
I have to set the spark  
And stroke the fire within him  
Oh I have to see him smile  
To have a happy heart  
  
I opened my eyes  
Walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes  
When I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
One day I just woke up  
I opened my eyes  
Opened the door took a walk outside  
And what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes when I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
Oh let me open my eyes  
Open the door and look up to the skies  
And leave the shore  
And let my hand trail in the cool water  
Float downstream, say goodbye to  
That dream--I just woke up  
  
I opened my eyes  
I walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my mind when I  
Opened the door--I just woke up

It was not the moon and not the wine  
And though you said you were a friend of mine  
I never felt that way inclined  
Oh the days were hot and the nights were long  
I must have sung a million songs  
But all the words just came out wrong  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line  
Hoped everything would turn out fine  
But I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day  
And then the rain came down and  
Sparkled the signs of the underground  
And the darkness fell all over town  
On the last day  
  
I think I dropped my guard that time  
I was flesh and blood and grit and slime  
And I think I may have lost my mind  
On the last day of summer  
I think I fell in love back there  
It was tooth and nail it was bones and hair  
And you'll never never know how much I cared  
On the last day of summer  
  
And though I think I fell that time  
It was not the only fault of mine  
But all I wanted was a sign  
On the last day  
I think you broke my heart that day  
And nothing I could do or say  
Could make the coldness go away  
On the last day  
  
The winter changes everything  
And the raindrops freeze  
On the signs of the underground  
I wonder will you think of me  
When you look up and see  
There's a full moon over London Town  
  
I think I was away the day  
When you said you were too smart to play  
And you'd only beat me anyway  
It's funny how I would have stayed  
And you said you were a friend of mine  
But that's not what I had in mind  
I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line -  
Hoped everything would turn out fine

Songs were sung and tales were told, life was like a dream  
Top men like the great King Arthur never came here ever after  
Ever since those gallant heroes gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Noted for diplomacy, once the mighty fall  
Touching pmp of pageantry, history books all show  
Husky dogs and great explorers  
Mighty kings and sage warriors  
Trouble take me since they're dead and gone

In the eyes of god we must be wrong

Falling down I said, falling down

Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Time was when a British Empire was in full control  
France and Spain were just the same if the truth be known  
Now the walls are down in Europe  
Forming laws with certain Arabs?  
Better get your petrol while you can  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down

London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
In the days gone by we'd pay for the things we'd got  
Now we pay to advertise while we sell the lot  
All the companies we started sold out on the open market  
Where are jobs now that they're gone?  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down

That at my leaving almost made me change my mind  
The night was darker than my scared and lonely eyes  
  
And then that old Manhattan moon began to rise  
And there stood Liberty in silhouetted skies  
And from that moment on I knew that I'd embrace  
Each opportunity to be a part of this place  
Five points and then Hell's Kitchen  
All stops in between  
Somewhere to find an itchin' for this keen Colleen  
Didn't stop me yearning now and then for my old world  
Dreamed I might return just once again to that old world  
But in my heart a piano roll played ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love that old Manhattan moon  
  
I swore allegiance at each rising of the moon  
And learned by heart each swinging Yankee Doodle tune  
And from the moment it first caught me in its beam  
I knew that moon would guide my old American dream  
Five points to Fifth Avenue Central  
All stops in between  
No time to get too sentimental for any shade of green  
That don't stop me yearning now and then for that funny old world  
Could be I'll return just once again to that funny old world

And when in the summer we go to the sea  
The things floating by aren't what we want to see

Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry

Getting her out of her box

What do I have to do?  
Why can't this hurt be through?  
I'm going head onto  
Something I know I will fail  
Why can't this kiss be true?  
Why won't you please let me through  
I don't understand why you always push me away  
  
Last thing I will like to do before it go away  
Is cry there next to you  
Cry and talk about the good all days and where they've gone  
And now how much I hate you

I feel the blood drip off my body as it goes right there  
  
I'm not, now  
What am I now?

And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,  
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.  
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,  
But it only took one night to bring it down,  
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.  
  
Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,  
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.  
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,  
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.  
  
Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,  
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.  
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,  
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow  
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed  
But I am living still.  
  
I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide  
Where steel and water did collide  
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado  
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below  
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound  
But I am still around.. I'll always be around.. And around and around and  
Around and around  
  
I fly a starship across the Universe divide  
And when I reach the other side  
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can  
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again  
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain  
But I will remain  
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..

Teachin' me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying.  
Talkin' of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend.  
  
Lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again.  
  
Comin' close together with a feelin' that I've never known before, in my time.  
She ain't ashamed to be a woman, or afraid to be a friend.  
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind.  
But dreamin' was as easy as believin' it was never gonna end.  
  
And lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again.

Ain't worth a piece of your mind.

Daydreams are somebody's lies.  
Lies ain't no harder than telling the truth.  
Truth is the perfect disguise  
  
Locked in the goldhandle bathroom  
Martin was changing his mind  
Shedding his humble pretensions  
One careful toke at a time  
And wiping the mask off the man in the mirror  
Who really was billy the kid  
Smiling at somebody dying  
For something that he never did  
  
Chorus:  
'cause nightmares are somebody's daydreams  
Daydreams are somebody's lies.  
Lies ain't no harder than telling the truth.  
Truth is the perfect disguise  
  
As soon as he sat down beside her  
Shining like saturday night  
Shandy was his for the saving  
Sweet as she looked in the light  
And maybe they moved from the bar to the bedroom  
Maybe just stood there instead  
Martin woke up wet and screaming  
Dreaming of blood on the bed.  
  
Chorus:  
'cause nightmares are somebody's daydreams  
Daydreams are somebody's lies.  
Lies ain't no harder than telling the truth.

Kris Kristofferson,Shipwrecked In The Eighties,/k/kris+kristofferson/shipwrecked+in+the+eighties_20218033.html,"Well you fight like the devil to just keep your head above water  
Chained to whatever you got that you can't throw away  
And you're shootin' through space on this river of life that you're ridin'  
And it's whirling and sucking you deeper on down every day  
So you turn to your trusty old partner to share some old feelings  
And you find to your shock that your faithful companion is gone  
And the truth slowly dawns that you're lost and alone in deep water  
And you don't even know how much longer there is to go on  
[ harmonica ]  
Like an old Holy Bible you clung to through so many seasons  
With the rules of survival in words you could still understand  
When they prove something wrong you believed in so long you go crazy  
And you're so close to folding the cards that you hold in your hand  
Singing Holy Toledo I can't see the light anymore  
All those horizon that I used to guide me are gone  
And the darkness is driving me farther away from the shore  
Throw me a rhyme or a reason to try to go on

But jealous and enraged her father seized him and chained him in the dungeon

Two daggers hidden underneath her coat

Wasn't bad so I had one more, for dessert  
Then I fumbled through my closet,  
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt  
And I shaved my face and combed my hair,  
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day  
  
I'd smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs  
That I'd been pickin'  
But I lit my first, and watched a small kid cussin' at a can  
That he was kickin'  
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell  
Of someone fryin'chickin  
And it took me back to somethin' that I had lost somehow,  
Somewhere along the way

Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone  
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound  
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming down  
  
In the park I saw a daddy,  
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'  
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,  
And listened to a song that they were singin'  
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away  
A lonely bell was ringin'  
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams  
Of yesterday

And that friends are harder to find  
Do tell me more about yourself  
We could share a thought or two  
Now who would mind?  
  
Maybe then we could go for a ride  
Drive down to the countryside  
Get away from the gray  
And frenzied hurly-burly of the city life  
  
Early yet to say what lies ahead  
It's the first day of the rest of our lives

For travelling strangers in distress  
It's nestled among the ghosts of the pines  
Under the shadow of a precipice  
  
When a lonesome climbing figure  
Slips and loses grip  
Tumbles into a crevice  
To his icy mountain crypt  
  
Bury him deep in love, bury him deep in love

How long this cold dark night is taking

Take me in, under your skin

Prays for guidance from above  
They sing, ""Hear our meditation,  
Lead us not into temptation  
But give us some kind of explanation  
Bury us deep in love""

You may lose me on the west

City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feeling kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound

Talking to you on the line  
Try to get used to this

Leaving me to dream of your kiss

I used to have a dream  
Now that I'm older  
I wake up to find it isn't as good as reality  
Cause you are here with me  
I was wishing on a star out in the universe  
Now that I'm wiser I finally find that all I need is here on Earth  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
  
Thinking back to long ago, you were the mystery  
All of the visions that I ever had could never live up to what I see  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
The good life Oooh, oooh, oooh...

Kylie Minogue,Good Like That,/k/kylie+minogue/good+like+that_20203947.html,"I've never been the type who's gonna wait around  
Not make a sound while others bring me down  
I'm not someone who'll tell you what you want to hear  
Oh you've got to feel by keeping it real  
  
And until now I've been patient  
I've been good somehow  
But anticipation's leaving me no doubt  
About how it will be  
When you let go of your fear and release  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's move it to the fast lane  
Take a chance and love me  
I'll give you all I have  
I'm good like that  
Baby, when you crash into me  
You'll finally understand  
How loving me can change all your plans  
  
I'm good like that  
I'm good like that  
Don't make me have to tell you that I told you so  
'Cause I know you know and it's hard to hold  
I cannot do this feeling, you'll find there's double meaning  
To the things I say when you walk this way  
  
Just relax, let me take control of you, sit back  
Make you see where all this goes  
I'm in too bad - what you got to lose  
Compared to what I'm offering you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm good like that  
I'm good like that  
So take a chance and love me fast  
I'll give you all-all that I have

Boys are all the same  
They're only looking out for just one thing  
I'm only hoping that  
You won't turn out like that  
I need some time 'til i can make up my mind

But i still come back for more
