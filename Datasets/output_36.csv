Hank Snow,A Daisy A Day,/h/hank+snow/a+daisy+a+day_20792732.html,"He remembers the first time he met her he remembers the first thing she said  
He remembers the first time he held her and the night that she came to his bed  
He remembers her sweet day of saying honey has something gone wrong  
He remembers the fun and the teasin' and the reason he wrote her this song  
I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day  
I'll love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away  
They would walk down the street in the evening and for years I would see them
go by  
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore  
Could be seen in the gleam in their eyes  
As a kid they would take me for candy and I'd love to go tagging along  
We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner  
And the old man would sing her his song  
I'll give you a daisy...  
[ fiddle ]  
Now he walks down the street in the evening and he stops by the old candy
store  
And I somehow believe he's believing he's holding her hand like before  
For he feels all her love walking with him and he smiles at the things she
might say  
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop and he gives her a daisy a day  
I'll give you a daisy...

Hug her every mornin', kiss her every night  
Give her lots of lovin', man, and treat her right

Hank Snow,A Letter To Santa Claus,/h/hank+snow/a+letter+to+santa+claus_20247203.html,"Dear Santa Claus, It's been so long  
So long since I have written  
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled  
I've moved from there and now I live  
On disillusion avenue  
And I've been here longer than I care to tell  
  
The twinkling bells of hope and joy  
The laughter that rang in my voice  
Have silenced more and more as time goes by  
Those treasured gifts from other years  
Are tarnished, lost or stained with tears  
So Santa would you bring a new supply  
  
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
My faith is gone, my courage low, my patience ran out long ago  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness  
And the grudges that I've gathered through the years  
And leave a large bag of forgiveness  
To give out to those who robbed me  
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears  
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding  
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends  
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine  
Lost it one too many times  
And make the new one longer if you can  
  
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Please Santa fill my empty heart this year

Hank Snow,A Petal From A Faded Rose,/h/hank+snow/a+petal+from+a+faded+rose_20299332.html,"Here's a rose from my garden  
Where the bloom of romance grows  
But I'll keep on a part near my aching heart  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
Love'd be sweet in the morning  
When the breeze of summer blows  
But will fade and die when the wind is nigh  
Like a petal from a faded rose  
  
Now our love is a memory  
Where it's gone nobody knows  
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
(I will live with the roses Where the sea of memory flows)  
And each time I dream then a tear will gleam  
On this petal from a faded rose

(spoken)  
Well howdy boys, howdy, man, man it sure seems like a long time  
Since I last rode down this old trail. How ya all anyhow?  
Fellas, you see, I still have this old cigar box with me. Yes Sir!  
And better yet, all the boys out here at the R.K. Ranch are singin'  
A new song now. Hope you like it because it's my answer to  
The Blue Velvet Band. It goes like this.  
By and old willow tree in the churchyard  
On the banks of the old Rio Grande  
Lies a loved one who died broken hearted  
She was known as the Blue Velvet Band  
She was called by the angels up yonder  
As the dew kissed the pale summer rose  
As we stood there in silence, dishearted  
These words to her lover did go  
Dear Jack, you mistrusted your darling  
You said that my love wasn't true  
You've roamed o'er the wide open spaces  
But my thoughts, they were always of you  
Now, my last wish was once more to see you  
But they say you're in some foreign land  
You're forgiveness is in this last message  
From your heartbroken Blue Velvet Band  
Far away o'er the lone western prairie  
Her message sped fast o'er the way  
To the side of a bed where her cowboy  
Was grieving his life fast away  
Please grant a last wish, boys, and lay me  
Out West on that old Rio Grande  
Neath that old willow tree in the churchyard  
By my sweetheart, the Blue Velvet Band

I see that bird on yonder tree  
The poor boy smiled and softly said  
Mother I wish that I could see.  
  
Yet, I the fragrant flowers can smell  
And I can feel the green leaves shade  
And I can hear the notes that swell  
From those dear birds that God has made.  
  
So mother God to me is kind  
Though sightless he has not given  
But tell me is there any blind  
Among the children up in heaven.  
  
Blind, oh no, my friend I am not blind  
My eyes may be closed but I don't mind  
For I see things far beyond your sight  
'Cause God gave me a sense to guide me alright.  
  
You don't understand  
How happy I can be  
Friend life's not made up alone  
Of what our eyes can see.  
  
Why you can see mountains  
And rivers and trees  
And you can find beauty in the flowers  
And the birds and the bees.  
  
Why I find a beauty  
That you'll never know  
The kind that comes from way inside  
The kind that comforts so.  
  
I've learned to think of everything  
As beautiful and bright  
'Cause God gave me that inner sense  
To take the place of light.  
  
Oh nom my darlin', they all see  
But why ask me, but why ask me you think so odd  
Why mother, God's so good to me  
I thought I'd like to look at God.  
  
Will be so nice when I can see  
But mother when you get up there  
Please tell me, mother, that it's you  
Because I've never saw you here,

Until the finale blow was given  
And God took up that poor blind boy  
And opened first his eyes in heaven...

Dark and cold and all alone  
You were my love  
Only love I knew  
And tonight I find I can't have you  
Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea  
Bury me deep where the sun...

Hank Snow,Canadian Pacific,/h/hank+snow/canadian+pacific_20172274.html,"I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland,  
Where I made a living in an iron mine.  
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia,  
And I fished the salty waters for a time.  
  
Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick,  
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.  
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other  
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile,  
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,  
Keep this wandering boy from harm.  
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.  
  
The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,  
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.  
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.  
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.  
  
Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,  
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.  
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,  
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.  
  
I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,  
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.  
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,  
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.  
  
Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,  
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,  
I got to British Columbia and heaven,  
On your track I made it back to my true love.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile.  
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,  
Keep this wandering boy from harm.  
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.

Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would
whirl  
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a
spell  
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could
tell  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind  
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I
loved  
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
  
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done  
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there  
  
I had but one chance and that was to run  
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did
ride  
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso  
  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing
is left  
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden  
My love is stronger than my fear of death  
  
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina
below  
  
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor  
  
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride  
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest  
  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my
chest  
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my
side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena
goodbye

I found love by the heartfull in the foreign distant land  
Tell the homefolks that I'm happy with someone who's true I know

And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone  
I still run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train
yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and

Through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam

You may doubt it but I swear there were cinders in my hair

When she smiled my heart did bubble

Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel

I'll win her heart, that's settled

But, oh my, how she battled  
She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down, didn't want me around

But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel

Hank Snow,Letter Edged In Black,/h/hank+snow/the+letter+edged+in+black_20247070.html,"I was standing by the window yesterday morning,  
Without a thought of worry or of care,  
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway,  
With such a happy look and jolly air.  
  
[Chorus]  
As I heard the postman whistling yester morning,  
Coming down the pathway with his pack,  
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,  
And then he said ""Good morning to you, Jack.""  
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
With trembling hand I took the letter from him,  
I broke the seal and this is what it said:  
""Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you!  
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!""  
  
""The last words that your mother ever uttered  
'Tell my boy I want him to come back,'  
My eyes are blurred, my poor old heart is breaking,  
For I'm writing you this letter edged in black.""  
  
I bow my head in sorrow and in silence,  
The sunshine of my life it all has fled,  
Since the postman brought that letter yester morning  
Saying,""Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!:""  
  
""Those angry words, I wish I'd never spoken,  
You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack?  
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking

Your golden curls in disarray upon your starched white pillow case  
The soft blue satin covers pulled up tight around your lovely throat  
It almost makes me want to go destroy the message on the note.  
  
The note I left upon your perfumed stationary by the phone  
I hate to think about you waking up at dawn to find me gone  
It hurts me so to get up in the middle of the night and go  
But thinking back I do remember faintly that I told you so.  
  
I told you I was like a bird, a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly.  
  
I only know that I must go and nothing here must hold me back  
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back  
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs  
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs.  
  
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair  
The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere  
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned  
The way you took this chance for love and took me just for what I am.  
  
I told you I was like a bird, a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high

And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood  
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good  
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay  
And someday you'll look back and know the best it ended up this way.

Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
She waits for the boy who marched away  
And though he's gone she hears him say  
""Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you

I don't pan out on the prophets good will and that sort of thing  
But I believe in God and the angels ever since one night last spring.  
  
I come into town with some turnips and my little Gabe came along  
No four year old in this country could beat him for purty and strong  
Pert and chipper and sassy and always ready to swear and fight  
And I learned him to chaw tobaccy just to keep his teeth milk white.  
  
The snow came down like a blanket as I passed by Taget's store  
I went in for a jug of molasses and I left the team at the door  
But they scared at somethin' and started and I heard one little squeal  
And lickety split over the prairie went team Little Britches and all.  
  
Yes lickety split over the prairie I was almost froze with skeer  
But we rousted up some torches and we searched from far and near  
At last we struck hosses and wagon snowed under a soft white mound  
Upsot dead beat but of little Gabe no hide nor hair could be found.  
  
And here all hope soured on me of findin' my little Gabe  
So I just flopped down on my marrow bones  
And crotched deep in the snow and prayed  
By this time the torches was played out and me and Israel Par  
Went off with some wood to a sheep fold that he said was somewhere thar.  
  
We found it at last in a little she'd where they shut up the lambs at night  
We looked in and seen them huddled there so warm and sleepy and white  
And there sot Little Britches and chirped as pert as ever you see  
I wants a chaw of tobaccy and that's what's the matter of me.  
  
How did he get there angels he could never have walked in that storm  
They just scooped down and toted him to where it was safe and warm  
And I think that savin a little child and fodging him to his own  
Is a dern sight better business than loafin' around the throne...

Just a picture from life's other side  
  
The first scene is that of a gambler  
Who had lost all of his money at play  
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger  
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day  
  
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it  
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide  
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side  
  
Now the last scene is that by the river  
Of a heartbroken mother and baby  
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast, soon no one will save  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darling and pride  
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side

As day was drawing to a close  
My eyes beheld a tragic story  
I saw a teardrop on a rose.  
  
It should have been a tear of gladness  
But deep inside the sorrow shows  
A trusting heart had just been broken  
I saw a teardrop on a rose.  
  
A sobbing tear that follows parting  
Holds all the pain that sorrow knows  
A false goodbye, a life is shattered  
There lies a story on a rose.  
  
The tear will dry the rose will wither  
When spring and winter comes and goes  
I loved, I lost, my story ended  
With just a teardrop on a rose.

Don't worry, 'cause I ain't got no wife

No use to sit at home and fine  
And let someone trouble your mind  
Just come along with me, there's more fish in the sea  
And I ain't got nothin' but time  
Now baby, just come on and smile  
You'll find that life is still worth while  
If you just look around and watch the fellars in this town  
That for you ain't got nothin' but time  
Lord, I ain't got nothin' but time  
So baby, if you wants to shine  
If you take time to look, my number's in the book

Hank Williams,I Can't Escape From You,/h/hank+williams/i+cant+escape+from+you_20064128.html,"I've tried and tried to run and hide  
To find a life that's new  
But where I go, I always know  
I can't escape from you.  
  
A jug of wine to numb my mind  
But what good does it do  
The jug runs dry and still I cry  
I can't escape from you.  
  
These wasted tears are souvenirs  
Of a love I thought was true  
Your memory is chained to me  
I can't escape from you.  
  
There is no end, I can't pretend  
That dreams will soon come true  
A slave too long to a heart of stone  
I can't escape from you.

Hank Williams,I Dreamed About Mama Last Night,/h/hank+williams/i+dreamed+about+mama+last+night_20188218.html,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true  
I dreamed about mama last night  
She read me the Bible like she used to do  
I dreamed about mama last night  
  
She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed  
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read  
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay  
Just how much mama worried when we children were away  
  
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night  
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright  
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three  
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key  
  
For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply  
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why  
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light  
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight  
  
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest  
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm  
The ones that she loved the best  
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men  
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then  
  
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care  
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there  
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed  
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said  
  
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light  
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright  
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep  
Her children safe from harm throughout the years  
And then she went to sleep  
  
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep  
I dreamed about mama last night

Left my gal an' left my home.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
Just a kid, acting smart,  
I went and broke my darling's heart,  
I guess I was too young to know.  
They took me off the Georgia Main,  
Locked me to a ball and chain.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
  
All alone I bear the shame,  
I'm a number, not a name.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
All I do is set an' cry  
When the evening train goes by.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
An' my hair turns whiter than snow.

WRITER HANK WILLIAMS  
Little Bosephus, you're the one, makes me feel good inside  
Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride  
I've always needed one like you to love and understand  
Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man  
There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life  
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice  
The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""  
And sometimes breaks a father's heart---wish you could skip that stage  
I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth  
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you  
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men  
And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in  
It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older  
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow  
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep  
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet  
So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude  
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude  
Ah, Sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know  
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes

That the old-time religion was real  
I said ""I'll go down, take a look at the crowd  
For just that weak-minded I feel.""  
  
I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door  
But the devil said, ""don't you go in!""  
But I said, ""it won't hurt me I'll just step inside  
And I'll set as far back as I can."" (but-)

Yes something got a hold of me (oh! lord)  
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night  
God certainly got a hold of me.  
  
They sang like they meant it, they all clapped their hands  
I said, ""it's commotion, that's all.""  
""when they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave

But I bowed that time, he got started to preach  
And he looked straight down at me  
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was  
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.

He loved ev'ry footstep, he loved ev'ry curl  
But she went to heaven, just one year ago  
The angels came for her, at the first fall of snow  
He still had the dolly that she used to love  
He held and caressed it and gazed up above  
He whispered, ?My baby, you're waiting, I know  
I'll bring you, your dolly at the first fall of snow?  
And there as I listened, my eyes filled with tears  
I knew she was part of his happier years  
His frail body trembled, he spoke soft and low  
I'll be with my baby at the first fall of snow  
I patted his shoulder, my feelings to hide  
He couldn't know I was crying inside

Hank Williams,THE FUNERAL,/h/hank+williams/the+funeral_20064186.html,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim  
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn  
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew  
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew  
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild  
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child  
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips  
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips  
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk  
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque  
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face  
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race  
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay  
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away  
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love  
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above  
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles  
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while  
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown  
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan  
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way  
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today  
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round  
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground  
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view  
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""  
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song  
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long  
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest  
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best

From the throne came A bright shining (C) angel,  
And he (G) stood on the land and the (D7) sea,

That (G) time was no (D7) longer to (G) be.

They (G) cried for the rocks and the (C) mountains,  
They (G) prayed, but their (D7) prayers were too (G) late.  
The rich man was there but his money,  
Had melted and vanished away,  
A pauper stood there in the judgement,  
His debts were too many to pay.  
The great man was there, but his greatness,  
When death came, was left far behind,  
The angel that opened the records,  
No trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there and the orphan,

No sorrow in heaven forever,  
God wiped all the tears from their eyes.  
The gambler was there and the drunkard,  
And they who had sold them the drink,  
With people who gave them the license,  
Together in hell they did sink.  
Repeat chorus  
The moral man to the judgement,  
But self rightousness would not do,  
For the men who had crucified jesus,  
Had passed off as moral men too.  
And the souls that had put off salvation,  
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by,  
No time now to think of salvation,  
At last they had found time to die.

While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones  
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well  
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell  
  
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how  
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now  
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then  
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men  
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done  
  
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son  
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands  
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands  
Those Broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too many
pals

To your earthly wealth, you must say goodbye  
Then it's useless to you, if you've strayed from the fold

The rich man like all, will be judged at that time  
But all of his wealth, will be left behind  
For no matter how much earthly wealth you get hold  
My friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul

At home alone I hang my head in sorrow

A blossom from an orange tree in your hair  
And while the organ plays I love you truly

I knew someday that you would wed another  
But wedding bells will never ring for me.

I thought if I'd climb up ole Ajax mountain maybe that would help me get it
all off my mind.  
I made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot. I thought a whole lot about
the rest of my life.  
I had no idea then soon it would nearly end up on this mountainside I would
nearly die.  
and there all in Alabama and there all in dixieland.  
God I'm dying here in Montana please Lord, just want to go back to hold her
hand just let me get back to my old homeland.  
They said I'd never sing again I learned a lot about my friends 'cause when
your shot down and out you don't get many calls  
but I saw some tears in some eyes and soon my poor old mother would die I
nearly lost it all when I lost my Grandpa.  
But you could find us all in Alabama yeah we're all down in Dixieland  
I didn't die out in Montana No Lord you let me get back to my own homeland and
I'm gonna hold on to her hand.  
I done a whole searching a whole lot of hurtin' before I finally found my road
in life  
you got to say things you want to say go on and do things your own way you can
climb any old mountain once you make up your mind

And eyes that would tempt any honky tonk man  
Then she came and sat down at my table  
And as she placed her soft hands in mine  
I found myself wanting to kiss her

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside  
  
Then we danced and she whispered I need you  
Take me away from here and be my big ol' southern man  
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw that look and  
I saw something else the reflection of my wedding band  
  
And I was almost persuaded to stip myself of my pride

And he wanted to fight  
And he jumped up  
And challenged every man in the room  
And just about the time he got the words out  
An 'ol boy jumped up and closed his mouth  
And used his head for a mop  
And his butt for a broom

And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
I can plow a field all day long  
I can catch catfish from dusk til dawn, yeah  
  
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too  
Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do  
  
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn  
  
We come from West Virginia coal mines  
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies  
  
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
I had a good friend in New York City  
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly  
  
My Grandpa taught me how to live off the land  
And his taught him to be a business man  
  
He used to send me pictures of the broadway nights  
And I'd send him some homemade wine  
  
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife  
For forty three dollars, my friend lost his life  
  
I'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eyes  
And shoot him with my ole 45  
Cause a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn  
  
We're from North California and South Alabam  
And little towns all around this land  
  
And we can skin a buck and run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
Country boy can survive

About life the way it really is  
He's not happy at home so he'll play them old songs  
And dance with someone that's not his  
  
When the man of the house has trouble with his spouse  
And she locks him out of the bedroom  
He'll just stroll down the street and some darlings he'll meet  
To have a drink and play them old tune

And I lost y two friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and there's curves  
But the one we got to observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway  
  
Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that  
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks  
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill  
He always helped kids in the city and you know what  
I think he always will  
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so  
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go  
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news  
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us  
Don't children always tell the truth  
  
I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by  
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away  
  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world  
Oh there's warning signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway

But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train.  
I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me.  
All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name.  
  
I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter,  
That said ""I don't love him. I'm leaving this cold mean man.""  
As the train pulled away from the platform  
And I put her in the wagon,  
With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man.  
  
And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin.  
In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame.  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.  
  
Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion.  
His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy.  
""One way or another,"" he said,  
""partner, I'm taking back my woman.""  
With my hand on my gun, I said, ""Don't bet your life.  
The lady says she's staying with me.""  
His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern  
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor.  
He was a dead man, but I have been too since I lost her.  
From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door.  
  
But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin.  
In the winter of '94, there burned one hell of a flame.

On a midnight ride

Just throw it away and you will see  
Someone will have it before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, they will  
  
Listen fellas, you know, it's not all the time  
That a man can have a good woman  
A woman that he can call his very own  
A woman who'll stay right there at home  
And mind the children while he's gone to work  
  
A woman who'll have his dinner cooked  
When he comes home  
Where some men make mistakes is when they go out  
And stay because they feel that no other man  
Wants his woman but him, but listen  
  
If you think no other man wants her  
Just throw her away and you will see  
Some man will have her before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will  
  
Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too  
Because you know I've seen so many women  
Who've had so many good men in life  
  
Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin  
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home  
Their hard earned pay  
Men who would give their women anything that their  
Little heart desired  
  
Where some women make mistakes  
Is when their men go out and let 'em play  
They would stay because they felt that no other  
Woman wanted him but her, listen  
  
If you think that no other woman wants him  
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see

ate  
  
Red said he wasn't very hungry but he came along anyway

And when he went on the stage for his own ten thousandth time  
  
We was all back to the curtains there just shootin' the lines  
  
But when he sang Peace In The Valley there was such a quiet still  
  
I know I'll never forget it and anyone that was there never will  
  
Well soon the last show was over with  
  
And I went back to the hotel and Red gave me a call  
  
I told him to come on over I was just starin' at the four walls  
  
So he came over to my room he was just next door there  
  
Lit a cigarette and sat down in the chair  
  
And he started talkin' bout all the worries that a country music singer has  
  
I said old Red I reckon it's not that bad  
  
He said yeah you're workin' a lot now and you'll have 'em some day  
  
Your dad had 'em and I have 'em I guess it's just meant that way

That'll last me forever  
And enough memories for one man's life (that is true)  
The one I love  
She ain't comin back ever  
So it looks like I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hand  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
O love let me down  
Now a truer friend I've found  
Why I've got my future on ice  
  
There was a time  
She was my one and only  
Until someone else caught her eye  
Then for awhile,  
Can you believe I was acting so lonely?  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hands  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
Yes love let me down  
Now a truer friend I found  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
O love let me down  
Now a real true friend I found  
Why I got my future on ice

Ain't got a thing to do  
I don't wanna go to the movies  
Couldn't if I wanted to, I'm on trial for lovin' you  
  
Now this all started in a honky tonk  
Just the other side of town  
A girl come in took a stool by me  
Ordered gin and drank it down  
  
She lit up a cigarette and turned around  
Well, she said my name is Jeannie  
And asked me what was mine  
I answered Hank and I walked  
To the jukebox droppin' a dime  
  
I looked at her short dress low neck line  
Well, we danced for five or ten minutes  
And I held her close to me  
  
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips  
And judged about twenty-three  
Whispered in my ears, I said, ""Yes siree""  
  
Now the scene is a little motel  
Out on the state highway  
And there's a room for two  
Love is about to take place  
  
And a state trooper breaks down the door  
Shines a flash light in my face  
I said, ""What the hell is this""  
And another man and woman come in  
  
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin'  
And she runs over to them  
Said, ""Thank God you're here  
He tried to hurt me mama""  
  
I said now you don't mean  
The cop says, ""Son the girl is seventeen""  
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse  
And the judge passed sentence on me  
  
And it's ten long years for statutory rape  
In the state penitentiary  
Lord, I can't believe this is happened to me  
  
So when next time you give a girl the eye  
She gives you that certain smile  
Just remember under that woman's breast  
May beat the heart of a child  
  
Don't you let yourself be the one  
To help a mixed up kids go wild  
This story happened a lot that's true  
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you

Makin' love in a sleepin' bag and holdin' me [pretty] tight  
We've spent the days side by side right upon the great divide  
And look across America and feel so free inside  
  
Oh Lord, that would be quite a change for a country boy like me  
Up there in the snow drifts right up to my knees  
And as I warm my hands by the fire  
I'd have to fight off the great desire  
To call that girl and ask her  
To come out here for a while  
  
I'm going to Montana to spend the winter  
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are so cold  
Way out there the blues will never find me  
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul  
  
I wish that special someone was goin' along  
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone  
Maybe I can find someone who cares  
A sweet simple baby who'd like to share  
This love I've held inside me for so long  
And help me sing my Montana song, ooh

Soft as the warm winds of April and pure as the heart of a child  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary one of her faces that I see  
I know about the moods of Mary 'cause one of her moods is me  
  
Mary will lie and deceive me she can be fickle and cold  
She'll offer her lips just to tease me and then give me heartaches untold  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary part of her personality  
I don't mind the moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me  
  
Mary can change like the seasons she can be tender and kind  
Then she hurts me without any reason and drives me out of my mind  
But I can live with the moods of Mary if that's the way it has to be  
I forget the other moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me

Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here  
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years  
I don't think its working like you planned  
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand  
  
I just read the headlines in the Nashville News  
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true  
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street  
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat  
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time  
He plead insanity like they do now all the time  
Sir what would you have done in 1859  
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free  
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe  
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns  
Aint the law changed alot since 1861  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just heard the new story on the radio  
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so  
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense  
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense  
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case  
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days  
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth  
  
He said youre living in the past you romantic fool  
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways  
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today

And stop there for a moment just to watch the children play  
Alone a boy was standin' and when I asked him why  
He turned his eyes that couldn't see and he began to cry  
People come for children and take them for their own

They always take some other child and I'm left behind

And just like for the other kids there'd be a home for me  
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles nobody wants me I'm nobody's child

Hank Williams Jr.,Something To Believe In,/h/hank+williams+jr/something+to+believe+in_21033824.html,"There ain't too much chance for opportunity  
In this town that I live in  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me  
And it's getting hard to contend  
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere  
If I don't get out of here  
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up  
Something more than the bars and the beers  
  
I need something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
Cause I got a bad case of the blues  
Something to believe in  
Something to make me feel right  
Something to believe in  
Is that asking too much out of life  
  
Well I quit my job  
And I'm leaving today  
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it  
I got a ticket going to L.A.  
And I'm hoping I can take it  
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus  
But I got faith in me and all new things I see  
I just need a little good luck  
  
Well I was getting down  
Soon I'd have to leave town  
And I was out walking the street  
When I met a girl  
By the burger world  
And I was needing her company  
By the way she was dressed  
I knew what to expect  
When we got to her motel room  
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown  
She starting crying and Lord I did too  
  
I need something to believe in  
Ah, baby something to look forward to  
Ah, do you feel like I do  
Something to believe in  
She said please stay with me tonight  
I want something to believe in  
Just talk to me and hold me tight  
  
She was just eighteen  
And I couldn't believe  
What had happen since she left home  
I thought I had some pains  
But it wasn't the same  
As the hell she had known  
So we packed our stuff  
And we got on the bus  
And now it's back to the same old grind  
But if you could have seen  
The way she looked at me  
When she saw the city limit sign  
  
We got something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
And I believe in me and you  
Something to believe in  
Holding each other tight  
Something to believe in  
That special something called being in love to get us by

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair  
From the look on his face and the size of his toes  
He comes from a place that nobody knows  
  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why  
  
I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee  
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie  
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky  
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day  
  
He says where he's from is called Albertane  
There they use more than ten percent of the brain  
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave  
They run around in underwear and they never shave  
  
Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird  
  
For the love of Pete come in!  
This is Baby Bird, sorry I was watching Court TV

Of course we copy, twenty four hours a day, in color  
  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest  
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed  
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane  
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane  
  
I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee  
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie

I can see it in your eyes,  
Under the moon as it plays,  
Like music every line,  
There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room,  
Where the passion's burning high,  
By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,  
It's always Penny and me tonight (Sayin' Ohoh, Mmmmm),  
On the plane step up with both my feet,  
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to nyc,  
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,  
Catch the view and another good book to read,  
Sitting at home on the friendly skies,  
Missin' her eyes,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,  
Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,  
Close our eyes, pretend to fly,  
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Singing Ohoh Nonono)  
Staring at a million city lights,  
But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,  
Feel the wind brushing slowly by,  
If I could soar I would try, to test these wings and fly,  
Away to where the leaves turn red,  
But no matter where I am instead,  
Singin' along to feelin' alright, (Mmmm)

When you think you got it made  
She's got the aces up her sleeve

Please?  
And can you tell me the story of the soldier?  
Please?  
One more time  
Or I'll knock your nose off  
  
Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away  
Lived a boy who had so many toys  
And he didn't know what to do with them all  
With them all, with them all  
Well, his favorite of all the toys  
Were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers  
And the one that he loved the most  
Was the one with the missing leg  
  
At night the toys would come alive  
Or that's how the story is told  
And there they met the soldier  
With the missing leg  
And the ballerina with the heart of gold  
At night they would share each others dreams  
Under the stars shining bright  
But they were too shy  
To speak of love, to speak of love  
  
One day the boy sat them on the windowsill  
To watch for the enemy coming over the hill  
But when the wind it blew  
It knocked him into the street  
And the boys from the town they said  
Won't you look at the one-legged soldier?  
Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away  
'Cause we can't find a use  
For a soldier with a missing leg  
  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
He was so lonely, yeah  
  
As he floated past a river rat  
On his homemade boat  
Well, the boat began to sink  
And he sank to the bottom of the river  
He got swallowed by a fish  
Caught by a fisherman  
Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys  
  
And the cook said, look at the one-legged soldier  
It looks just like the one we lost the other day  
Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg?  
  
But he was lonely, so lonely for a friend, oh  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
He was so lonely, yeah  
Oh yeah so lonely, oh yeah  
  
What about the ballerina?  
  
As he sat on the mantle piece to dry from the river  
The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side  
And when they got up to dance with each other  
She fell by the fire blazing bright  
When he jumped to save her from the flames  
Their bases began to melt into one and the same  
And now they share each other's destiny  
Together forever they will be  
  
And they are no longer lonely for a friend  
And they are no longer lonely for a friend  
No longer lonely, yeah  
No longer lonely  
Whoa, whoa  
Yeah, whoa  
No longer lonely, yeah

With them all, with them all

Stuck together at the base  
And they share each others destiny

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life,  
Never make a pretty woman your wife.

Get an ugly girl to marry you.

A pretty woman makes her husband look small,  
And very often causes his downfall.  
As soon as he marries her, then she starts,  
To do the things that will break his heart.  
  
But if you make an ugly woman your wife,  
You'll be happy for the rest of your life.  
An ugly woman cooks meals all the time,  
She'll always give you peace of mind.  
  
Chorus  
  
Don't let your friends say you have no taste,  
Go ahead and marry anyway.  
Her face is ugly, her eyes don't match.  
Take it from me, she's a better catch.  
  
Chorus  
  
Say, man?  
Hey baby!  
I saw your wife the other day.  
Yeah?  
Yeah, and she's sure is ugly. Ha!  
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!  
Yeah, alright.  
Unfortunately, she has acne.

Mingles my sweat with the earth below  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see woman on bended knee  
Cutting cane for her family  
I see man at the waterside  
Casting nets at the surging tide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray the day will never come  
When I can't awake to the sound of drum  
Never let me miss carnival  
With calypso songs philosophical

Lemon tree very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet,  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.  
  
Beneath the lemon tree one day my love and I did lie,  
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.  
We past that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree,  
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me.

One day she left without a word she took away the sun,  
And in the dark she'd left behind I knew what she had done.

A sadder tale, but wiser now I sing this song for you.

Although the season was Carnival  
We get together in bacchanal  
And they singing  
Back to back, belly to belly

See how she jumping out of the grave  
In one hand a quarter rum  
In the other hand she knocking Congo drum  
Believe singer start to make his rhyme  
The Zombies are racking their bones in thyme

And tell her miss Bardot take it slow  
All the men think they're Casanova  
When they see that she's bare foot all over  
Even old men out into beaker  
Find their hearts getting weaker and weaker  
So I goin to ask her for your sake and mine  
At least to wear her ear rings part at the time

And I'm afraid they're going too far  
So it's up to us you and me  
To put an end to Catastrophe  
We must appeal to their goodness of heart

Isabelle already knew  
There'll be horizons and skylines and other lovers  
But I always remember you  
  
If I could rearrange history  
And give it to you as a gift  
There would be one more movement  
In beethoven's fifth  
  
Why, oh why, in a land of plenty  
Some just have to make due  
At the end of a breadline with just a penny  
I'll always remember you

There is an element of fun  
You find the fun and snap  
The job's a game  
In every task you undertake  
Becomes a piece of cake  
A lark, a spree  
It's very clear to see  
That a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
A robin feathering his nest  
Has very little time to rest  
While gathering his  
Bits of twine and twig  
Though quite intent in his pursuit  
He has a merry tune to toot  
He knows a song  
Will move the job along  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
The honeybees that brings the nectar  
From the flowers to the comb  
Never tire ever buzzing to and fro, no  
Because they take a little nip  
From every flower that they sip  
And hence they find  
Their task is not a grind  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down

Buy the railroad track

It's only green lights and alright

Sing it again the notes never end

Just the sound of your voice  
The light in your eyes  
We're so far away from yesterday  
Together, with a wink and a smile

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' santa said  
""little boys like you should be in bed""  
  
So I hollered ""ho! ho! ho!""

Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window

Admittedly, the cross is mine  
The time is come  
Forsake the brine  
Alone with the void for a thousand years  
I am the first of the reptillian rocketeers  
Doom shins it's bitter brink  
Its goblins casting stench to pave the way  
I'm going off to seek the soul  
Who'll teach me of the day  
A boy will be born in the garden  
I'll wait on a patch of green grass  
Somehow he'll know to find me there  
And place a star upon my crust  
We'll trace the crescent's rim  
Pawn's pursuit of deliverance  
My soul a satchel for musical vim  
Then I'll return to save my race

"Harry Connick, Jr.",Stardust,/h/harry+connick+jr/stardust_20064396.html,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
  
Steals across the meadow of my heart  
  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
  
Love is now a stardust of yesterday  
  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
  
The melody haunts my reverie  
  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
  
And each kiss an inspiration  
  
But that was long ago  
  
Now my consolation  
  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside the garden wall  
  
When stars are bright  
  
You are in my arms  
  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
  
Of paradise where roses bloom  
  
Though I dream in vain  
  
In my heart it will remain  
  
My stardust melody  
  
The memory of love's refrain

Rusted angels floating everywhere  
St. Michael singing to the spirits passing by  
To blacked out windows and the silence there inside

The hotel by a train  
The well known ghosts remain

And the plow and the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow

For the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep  
And the mountains are filled with little lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who would judge the many when the game is through  
Ring them bells for the time that flies,  
For the child that cries when  
Innocence dies

From the top of the room  
Ring them bells from the fortress  
From the lilies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong

Ring them bells  
Ring them bells

You've been hiding - never letting it show  
Always trying to keep it under control  
You got it down and you're well  
On your way to the top  
But there's something that you forgot  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you  
You might need it some day  
  
I can't tell you what you're feeling inside  
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy  
Something's missing and you got to  
Look back on your life  
You know something here just ain't right  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you

But time goes on and you were gone  
I got told you you're a big shot for the ties  
And take it from behind  
  
Now you took a new flat in a different town  
And rumors are you're wealthy now  
For that high class dress shows you earn well  
Where strangers come and go  
  
Do you feel good, do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool, not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Some busty companion claims to know you well  
Does night shift at some place somewhere  
Said there's no one who has fun your way  
In Moscow, Rome, LA  
  
I wish, I knew  
Jolly understand  
And you never call  
  
Do you feel good, do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool, not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Well I got no objections  
I'm old enough, you know  
But it's weird this night I seem to know you  
Better than before

Do you live cool, not too confined

One step closer to what you live for

To be the fire in a hot life you choose

In the night I call your name  
You're the light in times of shame!  
The songs I sing  
All my love I bring for you!  
  
I always try to make things better  
Everything that has gone wrong  
Mighty plans in the right direction  
But very little has been done  
Everyday when I try to get forward  
I find myself another mile back  
Help me fighting!  
Help me breathing!  
Why am I falling down instead?  
  
Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you  
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do  
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!  
  
In the night  
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you  
  
Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find  
The freedom we search  
'Cause all that we need is inside!  
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while  
And when it gets dark  
No chance will be there for a try  
  
When I wake up early in the morning  
I catch a book and jump inside  
I fill my head with a million wonders  
And try to fill the night with light  
The moment when I get things clearer  
I see another mountain to climb  
And always when I think I'm nearer

Steam breaking on his brow  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going

At stations one by one  
His woman and his best friend  
In bed and having fun  
And oh, he's crawling down the corridor  
On his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
No way to slow down, oh  
No way to slow down  
  
He hears the silence howling  
When he catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner  
Has got him by the balls  
Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible  
And it's open at page one  
I think God, he stole the handle

A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free  
If I don't want to know, what's written inside me  
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?  
  
Restless minds have searched, long before  
The truth will be the same, for evermore  
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel  
Can give you all you need, just listen still  
  
Here is love and there is pain  
It's all around, it's all the same  
There's nothing new that I could tell to you  
  
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts  
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject  
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be  
  
There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know  
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do

Helloween,Raise The Noise,/h/helloween/raise+the+noise_20895382.html,"Since ages now we're caught and occupied  
With our basic civil rights denied  
They came-to-conquer, took our beloved world  
We're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace  
  
Some never knew what freedom was  
Now, there's guards everywhere  
Someone come!...  
Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
I'll sing it while you're gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There won't be another song now or whenever  
  
But they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies  
Though exposed to complex things just faint  
This way they're rendered helpless easy prey  
To be grabbed and bound safely locked away  
  
Aldo here's one guy to play the pipe  
Summons mean tunes that kill  
Stadium like set up and verified  
Knock 'em out with your skill  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
I'll sing it while you're gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There won't be another song now or whenever

Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive  
  
The scientists got no way to fight  
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right  
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on  
You just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrong  
  
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm  
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm  
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door  
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore  
  
You won't believe 'till you know that it's real  
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel  
You need a shit so you head off to the loo  
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do !

Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain!  
I'll surely make our children feel a lot more sane!

And today we're all faced with death, rubbers, and AIDS

Some dictator felt progressive  
And lay down in the sun  
But his people were aggressive  
They killed him with a gun  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right  
You'll be cut down to size  
Like a lie

That ain't nice at all

You can't recall or care at all  
So better use your brain  
  
A little dragon could spit fire  
But never so for something bad  
He didn't know the knight's desire  
To throw a lance into his head  
  
Romeo loved his Juliet  
Their parents told them ""Stop""  
Then it all turned out peculiar  
He couldn't get it up  
  
And it's all in vain  
When you're living with pain  
Reap not goods you have grown  
By your own  
  
Feelings you like  
Disappear overnight  
You sip up every grin  
Free to win

It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
You nearly go insane  
  
A spaceman flies the rocket  
That takes him to the stars  
Thinks his wife is in his pocket  
But she's strolling 'round in bars  
  
The king of Los Angeles  
Bought himself a teddy bear  
And the queen became shameless  
She did it with a chair  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right

Our strength will last forever  
Push us as far as we can go

Don't tell me you did not see that I cried  
Don't act so deaf and blind  
Don't think that if someones made dumb to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
Now you call me liar  
'Cause you are just the

you'd all turn your back  
Won't give any dime

Looking from the outside  
I'm standing here but all I want  
Is to be over there  
Why did I let myself believe  
Miracles could happen  
Cause now I have to pretend  
That I don't really care  
  
I thought you were my fairytale  
A dream when I'm not sleeping  
A wish upon a star  
That's coming true  
But everybody else could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
When there was me and you  
  
I swore I knew the melody  
That I heard you singing  
And when you smiled  
You made me feel  
Like I could sing along  
But then you went and changed the words  
Now my heart is empty  
I'm only left with used-to-be's  
Once upon a song  
  
Now I know your not a fairytale  
And dreams were meant for sleeping  
And wishes on a star  
Just don't come true  
Cause now even I could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
Cause I liked the view and  
When there was me and you  
  
I can't believe that  
I could be so blind  
It's like you were floating  
While I was falling  
And I didn't mind

Where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow  
We are doing our best to disown the golden mean  
By these acts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free

We're dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
On the verge of a vow to kill all reason locking that door  
To a nightmare within a nightmare we are bound to adore  
Let the pleasure in the shape of a heart lie to me  
And finally confirm all fears to be so real  
Be so real

Killing love with a kiss

While the winter sings: ""Your love will be the death of me""

Brought from the world where devils reign  
And intoxicated angels with sorrow  
They witnessed in the eyes of their slaves

And hell to white  
Right so wrong and wrong so right  
  
Feel it turning your heart into stone  
Feel it piercing your courageous soul  
You're beyond now- redemption  
And no one's going to catch you when you fall  
  
I see you crawl  
You can barely walk  
And arms wide open  
You keep on begging for more  
I've been there before  
Knocking on the same door  
It's when hate turns to love  
And love to hate  
Faith to doubt and doubt to faith
