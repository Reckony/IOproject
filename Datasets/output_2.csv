Backstreet Boys,Something That I Already Know,/b/backstreet+boys/something+that+i+already+know_20658413.html,"Here we are, seven days  
And seven nights of empty tries  
It's ritual, habitual  
But it's never gonna work this time  
  
We're to the point of no return  
And along the way the only thing we've learned  
Is how to hurt each other  
  
I'm looking back and wondering why  
It took so long to realize  
That nothing's changed, it never will  
All these years of standing still  
And still we stay in all this pain  
And nothing's gonna make it go away  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
  
So save your voice  
Don't waste your breath  
Can't you see we're at the end  
And this goodbye is permanent  
So wish me well and try to forget  
  
And all the fights  
And all the ways  
We almost made it  
But we never did  
And it's finally come to this  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
  
We can not hide what we've become  
So sick and tired of being numb  
It's done, it's done  
It's done  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
'Cause I know, I know, I know  
'Cause I know, 'cause I know

Backstreet Boys,Spanish Eyes,/b/backstreet+boys/spanish+eyes_20011580.html,"Here we are in the arms of one another  
And we still go on searching for each other  
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is  
right for us tonight  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a place I've never been  
And it comes from deep within  
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize  
Knowing all I have to do  
Is reach out my hand to you  
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes  
  
Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers  
Who believe that we see no wall between us  
How can they be in my heart and in my mind,  
when all I could find  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I loved you from a distance  
Thought I couldn't reach that far  
I can't believe how close that we are

Backstreet Boys,Trouble Is,/b/backstreet+boys/trouble+is_20658331.html,"How come you never know  
What you got until it's gone  
Too bad  
Because I never felt so good with anyone  
How fooled was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
  
So every day I try a little harder  
To forget her  
Lie here convince myself  
Tomorrow will be better  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
Love is what the trouble is  
Love is what the trouble is  
  
How come she said  
You never wear your heart  
Where I can see  
Too bad  
'Cause now I'm the one  
Who's sorry  
How stupid was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
So everyday I find a little something  
To remind me  
No matter how I try  
I can't put the past behind me  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
  
Love has let me go  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
I'll be fine, give it time  
  
But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone (she's gone)  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)  
And now I know what it is (yes I do)

Taste of freedom before getting  
Married next week.  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
At least, you're not an  
Indentured servant.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Indentured servant?  
  
Erika-  
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot  
Madame Carp will make me pay,  
And I have to fetch the eggs myself  
And the barn's a mile away.  
It's cold and wet  
But still I get an omelette on my plate,  
But in my head I'm back in bed  
Snuggled up and sleeping late.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Really?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Really. But it's all right.  
I mean, I'm used to it.  
And you?  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Well...  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Well?  
Anneliese-  
If I want some eggs I ring the bell  
And the maid comes running in,  
And she serves them on a silver tray  
And she brings a cookie tin.  
And while I eat, she rubs my feet  
And strolling minstrels play,  
But I'd rather be in my library  
Reading science books all day.  
  
Erika-  
I'm just like you  
Anneliese (speaking)-

You're just like me

Somewhere that's ours  
Somewhere that dreams come true  
Yes I am a girl like you.  
You'd never think that it was so  
But now I've met you and I know,  
It's plain as day  
Sure as the sky is blue  
I am a girl like you.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
So, you're a singer?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary.  
Uh, I mean, Dress Emporium.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
I love Madame Carp's dresses!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
I made the one you're wearing.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
You made this? The design looks so complicated!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Oh, it isn't really.  
(sings)  
First I choose a fabric from the rack  
And I pin the pattern down,  
And I stitch it in the front and back  
And it turns into a gown!  
Anneliese-  
I wear my gown  
Without my crown  
And dance around my room  
Both-  
And imagine life without the strife  
Of an unfamiliar groom.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
But I'd never let my mother know.  
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.

With the recycling.

The mistletoe got mangled,  
And even though my nerves are jangled,  
I'm good with everything!

One lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you,  
Here beside you  
Anywhere you go, let me go too

Noodle soup, poodle soup,  
Talking crows with the croup,  
Almost anything.

Already holding what is real?

And I tell you, I'm keeping up the strength  
I gotta try 'cause you ain't getting past this heart of mine  
I'm out here waiting for you with all I've got to give  
And I accept this life we live  
  
I'll be your lover and I'll be your friend  
I'm gonna follow you right to the end

I only came to make you realize  
  
I'll be your hero and I'll be your clown

Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait  
'Cause come tomorrow, will be too late  
  
Come tomorrow, oh, come tomorrow  
  
I got to turn away my face  
'Cause you blind me with your light  
Can you catch up to me?  
You know I love you in the black of night

And we try, we try to carry on  
  
And you innocents, you get to find the things in life  
That get you through

And deep inside, the things you were  
No one ever knew

Let me make it happen  
This world we have foreseen

When I've got you  
  
Then I only see the sunny side  
Even trouble has its funny side  
When you're gone, my sugar candy  
I get so lonesome, I get so blue  
  
But when you're handy  
It's fine and dandy  
But when you're gone  
What can I do?

Living a sunshine  
And a cloudy sky can lead to a rainbow  
Lookin' at life that way  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you're lucky to find a special man  
You gotta love him all you can  
And anything he wants from you  
Should be the least that you can do  
Don't let him down  
Just give him love  
Don't let his dreams turn into dust  
He's only tryin' to build a wonderland for two  
If you're the one to share his world  
Just be the someone he can trust  
For the sake of love  
For the love of love  
For pete's sake  
Don't let him down  
Don't let him down  
  
You can live in a castle  
And dream of your diamonds  
Thinkin' you really walk tall  
But livin' and dreamin' when you're alone  
Ain't livin' or dreamin' at all

On September 12th right here,  
In front of Waverley, but unfortunately,  
I lost his address.  
He was last seen with his friend,  
A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles,  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back.  
I love him but it embarrasses me,  
To walk down the street with him.  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere,  
And wears a white crash helmet.  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket,  
And on the back are written the names,  
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels"".  
I would gratefully appreciate it,  
If you see him, tell him,  
I'm in the park with my girlfriend.  
And please,  
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back,  
Just him.

Certain parties with bird-brains are getting the bird.  
Au revior, fare-thee-well and goodbye. And I'll tell you why.

I lost the young fella I've been dreaming of.  
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call,  
To someone who's no fun at all.  
Well, I've stopped forgetting, what else can I do?  
And much thanks for letting me practise on you.  
It's farewell my lovely, excuse, please, my dust.  
Unravel and travel I must.  
No tears, no hurt surprise,

And it wandered away  
  
One golden sky  
One spark of light  
Forever will remain

Brought us close, kept us warm  
All alone making love  
In the rain  
  
Gone is the world outside  
Home on the turning tide  
True love will find the sun  
And know the reason why  
  
You make me hunger for

And the night will become  
Our golden dawn  
  
Two hearts as one  
No tears to cry  
With you I have it all  
  
If love can never die  
I'm not afraid to fly  
But how far must I fall  
  
One silver song  
One lullaby  
For all the love we make  
  
It's the look in your eyes  
It's the moon on the rise  
It's the sound of the heart  
That you break  
  
Gone is the dark of night  
Call on the early glow  
Send down the birds of love  
That circle us below  
  
And still I will hunger for  
You whispering, ""Mi amor""  
Over the ocean's roar  
And your arms reach for me

While I stand there and wait for his coming  
With the house swept and the clothes hung  
And a pot on the stove where I had meal  
  
Where is he while I waste the rising newel?  
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?

A thousand miles away, a million years ago

It was blue as ink  
Or at least I think  
I remember sky  
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks  
Coming down like lint  
And it made you squint when the wind would blow  
And ice like vinyl on the streets  
Cold as silver, white as sheets  
Rain like strings and changing things  
Like leaves  
I remember leaves  
Green as spearmint  
Crisp as paper  
I remember trees  
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas  
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos  
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes  
Light and noise and bees and boys  
And daaaaays, oh!  
I remember days or at least I try  
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze  
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.

We must be lovin' right  
All of our friends say  
Love fades away with time.  
But I know they're wrong  
'Cause they've never known  
A love like yours and mine.  
So if the whole world goes crazy  
Let everyone else fuss and fight.  
When all's said and done  
We'll be the lucky ones.  
We must be lovin' right.  
Some folks got nothin' but troubles.  
Oh so little joy in their lives.  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows.  
We must be lovin' right.  
We must be lovin' right.

Barbra Streisand,If You Could Read My Mind,/b/barbra+streisand/if+you+could+read+my+mind_20013119.html,"If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well  
  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I will never be set free  
As long as I am  
A ghost that you can see  
  
If I could read your mind, love  
What a tale your thoughts could tell

That kind the drugstores sell  
  
When you reach the part  
Where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me  
The heroes often fail  
And you won't red that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take  
I'd walk away like a movie star  
Who gets spurned in a three-way script  
Ends up number two  
The movie queen to play the scene  
And bringing all the good things out in me  
But now for love, lets be real  
I never thought I could feel this way  
And I got to say  
That I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back

And if you're cosmic'ly conscious you'll see  
Why she's a princess incarnate to me  
Daughter of Neptune the ruler of the sea

I'm coming back when the aspects are right""  
And now I look in the paper each day  
Wonderin' what my horoscope will say

In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train

Now I could take and sock away my dough  
And make me six percent a year  
But it's not much fun to wait around for that  
When I can spend it while it's here  
Ah  
Let's get dressed up  
And see a movie  
I like spending my money  
And I like having a good time  
Good times sure make me happy  
And I'm so happy  
'Cause I just got my pay  
Monday morning I'm up and at it  
Those last two days were good for my soul  
It's time to do my working thing  
I'm late so I got to roll  
My take home comes to 'bout ninety-five  
And my boss is giving me some praise  
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart  
I think I'll hit him up for a raise  
(Hit 'I'm up get a rais)

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

By, by baby don't go  
Written, written in to his show

Played understudy to every part  
Got given all the dullest lines

Well, who indeed?

A few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Yes, Chip

Will I ever get to be a boy again?

I hope so

When will I know?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Soon. If it's to be. It will be very soon now. Come along, son.  
  
Belle  
  
Knowing now, that this was indeed the legendary sword called ""Excalibur,""
Arthur tried to pull it from the stone. He tried  
Once to no avail. He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out.
Then, for the third time, Arthur drew forth the  
Sword...  
  
Beast  
  
So that must mean he's the king!  
  
Belle  
  
Wait and see  
  
Beast  
  
I never knew books could do that  
  
Belle  
  
Do what?  
  
Beast  
  
Take me away from this place, make me forget for a little while  
  
Belle  
  
Forget?

Who I... What I am...  
  
Belle  
  
We have something in common, you know  
  
Beast  
  
What is that?  
  
Belle  
  
In the town where I come from, the people think I'm odd  
  
Beast  
  
You?  
  
Belle  
  
So, I know how it feels to be... Different. And I know how lonely that can be  
  
Belle  
  
For the third time, Arthur drew forth the sword, and there arose from the
people a great shout. Arthur is king.  
  
Beast  
  
I told you so...

About my wife, where I belong.

Two years on two years on

Let this be my prayer, to keep you safe when I'm not there.  
  
Can we love and live apart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
How can we divide the heart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).  
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word.  
Embrace.  
  
Through the mists of time, lovers can be friends.  
The power of the human heart.  
The secrets in the souls of men.  
All my blessings in disguise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
Reunited we will rise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).

And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
Another daybreak, another heartache,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives,  
Away from you.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely life.  
Lonely days and nights (away from you).  
We can live our life  
(embrace, embrace)  
With our separate lives.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Lonely days and nights.  
I will never send away.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Embrace the child inside  
The lonely, lonely lives.

A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are  
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her

Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud

Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you

And there's a part of me with you

You've got to give a little, take a little,  
And let your poor heart break a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
  
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,  
Until the clouds roll by a little.

As long as there's the two of us,  
We've got the world and all it's charms.  
And when the world is through with us,  
We've got each other's arms.  
  
You've got to win a little, lose a little,

Bette Midler,The Rose,/b/bette+midler/the+rose_20017078.html,"Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed  
Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose.

I'll never be the same

And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
I'll never be the same since we're apart  
But there's a lot that a smile can hide  
And I know deep down inside  
I'll never be the same, never be the same again

And the TV works, but the clicker is broken

To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected

And I walk away with the wrong impressions  
I don't care 'cause I've done my share  
And I need some time for my own obsessions  
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by

She had a rhythm all her own  
He blew a solo like a blind man  
She really dug his saxophone  
She wanted more than just an encore  
And he could play in every key  
He left the stage and packed his alto  
And took it home with Christie Lee  
Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the Bible  
You know the man could blow an educated axe  
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman  
Who didn't need another lover  
All she wanted was the sax

It took a while for him to see

They say he always drinks alone  
They say he stumbles like a blind man  
They say he sold his saxophone

You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
And you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
You don't want to lose a friendship  
There's nothing that you have to hide  
And a little dirt  
Couldn't hurt no one anyway  
And you still have a rage inside you  
That you carry with a certain pride  
In the only part of the broken heart  
That you could ever save  
But you've been through it once  
You know how it ends  
You don't see the point  
Of going through it again  
And this ain't the place  
And this ain't the time  
And neither's any other day  
So you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
So you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons  
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone forever  
And if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakes  
After the moment passes  
And the impulse disappears  
You can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easily  
It's a time honored resolution  
Because the danger is always near  
It's with you now  
But that ain't how it was supposed to be  
And it's hard to believe after all these years  
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears  
And you feel like a fool  
Because it's part of your rules  
You've got a memory  
But you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence

But you can't talk about it

Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal  
Boy, you got to get it settled

Is someone who's free

Things are not the same, baby  
You overcame such a bad attitude  
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks  
And nowadays it's politics  
And after 1986 what else could we do?

We turned and cursed as one  
We pulled the shades  
And closed our eyes  
The Stockholm city lights  
Were slowly starting to rise  
And we were strapped against  
Those Scandinavian skies  
The landing gear came down  
And touched the Swedish ground  
And we were all so paralyzed  
On the plane  
We were mainly sound and lights  
In the veins  
We could play the blues all night  
The tour of Germany  
Was bleeding into our eyes  
And we were sailing over  
Scandinavian skies  
We had the Midas touch  
Until we met the Dutch  
And they exhausted our supplies  
Who's to pay?  
For this international flight  
Who could stay  
We were only there for the night  
We watched the power fall  
Inside the Olso hall  
While all the cold Norweigians cried  
Who could say  
What was left and where was right?

I could play the blues all night

But it's just as well  
I haven't shown you everything a man can do  
So stay with me baby  
I've got plans for you  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
And now I need the rest of you  
  
Did you know that before you came into my life  
It was some kind of miracle that I survived  
Some day we will both look back  
And have to laugh  
We lived through a lifetime  
And the aftermath  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know we've got to move somehow  
But I don't want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes it's so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
I'm warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you

From someone who's not over you?

Have I been lonely without you?  
I tell myself  
How much I really don't care  
How many nights

Wanting to hold you

When your day is done

Never thought I'd do before  
But if the strain brings happiness,  
More or less.

With all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
And when times are tough, I've got just enough  
If you're standing right by my side

All the ways you keep me satisfied

Push those buttons and answer that phone  
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy

And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

There's your hoe out in the sun  
Where you left a row half done  
You claim that hoein' ain't no fun (well I can prove it)  
You ain't got no ambition

I'd say no more work for mine (welcome to the club)  
On my door I'd hang a sign  
Gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'  
  
Papa Bing (yeah Louis)  
I stopped by your place a time or two lately  
And you aren't home either  
Well, I'm a busy man Louis. I got a lotta deals cookin'  
I was probably tied up at the studio  
You weren't tied up you dog  
You was just plain old  
  
Gone fishin' (bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah)  
There's a sign upon your door (Pops, don't blab it around, will you?)

Gary)  
Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take
a side)  
But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)  
You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)  
You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)

Keeps his darling in suspense  
And he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And you know every dove  
Has its heart set on love  
Rabbits, too, pet and pat  
And there's nothing wrong with that  
  
When a boy such as I  
Tries so hard to qualify  
With a very lovely lady such as you  
Can't you see it's the natural thing to do  
  
And then the girl she acts demure  
The boy he feels proud and sure  
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  
Fine thing  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
But the girl she just won't agree  
She whimpers and she simpers  
And he begs on bended knee  
But she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue  
The chump  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
Then the boy in despair  
Waves his arms, tears his hair  
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad  
Then you know that he's got it bad  
  
Then the girl she ought to fall  
If she's got a heart at all  
She should take him in her arms  
And kiss him too

And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand

Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair  
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand  
Says he, ""I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band""

Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come  
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum  
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand  
They shout, ""There's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band!""  
  
Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green  
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen  
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland  
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band

Is it just me  
Or does somebody else believe this  
Well I'm not alone  
And I'm not afraid  
There's just one way to see  
  
Chorus:  
After all etc.  
  
What do you say to the dead  
Is there a place where it's burning  
It says in a book I once read  
Yes there's a chance of returning  
Turn to me  
  
The fundamental principles  
Say nothing of forever  
But those are voices that I hear  
Or I'm just not so clever  
  
It can't be me  
I know somebody else believes this  
Well I'm not alone  
I'm not afraid  
Just one way to see  
  
After all etc.

Black Sabbath,After Forever,/b/black+sabbath/after+forever_20019384.html,"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?  
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave  
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?  
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?  
  
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?  
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a
fool?  
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways  
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days  
  
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say  
If they knew you believe in God above?  
They should realize before they criticize  
that God is the only way to love  
  
Is your mind so small that you have to fall  
In with the pack wherever they run  
Will you still sneer when death is near  
And say they may as well worship the sun?  
  
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ  
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced  
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?  
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve  
  
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone  
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one  
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate  
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.

A fourth nights tour on the continent was planned  
And each had his portmento in his hand  
Down the Rhine they ment to have a picnic to Joan siad I must decline  
The boys are being advised by me  
Stay away from Germany  
What's the good of going down the Rhine

Let's all go down the strand

Come with me and see what you can find  
Let's all go down the strand

That's the place for fun and noise  
All amoung the girls and boys  
So let's all go down the strand  
  
One day 5 and 20 convicts  
Satted by their 20 little cells  
The bell then sounded ding-a-ding-a-dong  
To exercise the prisoners came along  
Buggler Ben exclaimed to Jacks The Warden  
To me sir, It's very strange  
The men are tired of going round  
Round and round the same old ground  
I purpose we make a little change

Gray crowds gathered round to welcome  
Shackleton returning from the poll  
The Lord Mayor welcomed all the galant crew  
And said my lads, I've got a treat for you  
Come with me, The mansion house awaits you  
A banquet shall be supplied  
But a towering, grumbling mood  
Said we don't want any food  
Then he turned to Shackleton and sighed

Babe, I'd run circles all around.  
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.  
When my time arrives you better run for your life

You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.

Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+of+donald+white_20155910.html,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.

And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Catfish on the mound.  
""Strike three,"" the umpire said,  
Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm  
But the old man wouldn't pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Come up where the Yankees are,  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,  
Smoke a custom-made cigar,  
Wear an alligator boot.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Carolina born and bred,  
Love to hunt the little quail.  
Got a hundred-acre spread,  
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein' nothin' but the curve,  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve.

Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game.  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame.

Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,/b/bob+dylan/chimes+of+freedom_20021149.html,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid

They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""

A jeep to drive, blood to spill.

They sent him back into the race without any brakes.

He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.

He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.

Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.

Bob Dylan,Clothes Line,/b/bob+dylan/clothes+line_20021565.html,"After a while we took in the clothes,

Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""  
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""

Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,

I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""  
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""  
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""

""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""

Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere

All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that

Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.

As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well life is for love  
And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on

But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.  
To take part in any quiz.  
It's just that I ain't got no watch  
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.

Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.

So long Arizona, so long desert sands

Here comes old rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Here come the men faces hidden from the light  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in vegas happens in moline  
On the blue blood streets of boston  
Up in berkeley and out in queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go

Bob Seger,Fire Inside,/b/bob+seger/fire+inside_20021922.html,"Words and music by bob seger  
  
There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside

There wasn't one thing I would not do  
I still recall the love in your eyes  
Blue like the sky on a clear sunrise  
And it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
It was Real At The Time  
  
You were a lioness tall and lean  
You were the best thing I'd ever seen  
I heard a loneliness in your voice  
I charged ahead I had no choice  
Cause it felt Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like a mountain you climb  
It felt Real At The Time  
  
And babe you meant so much to me  
I never will forget your face  
I never will forget those nights  
Those nights  
Those nights  
  
Lost in the pettiness and the fights  
Lost in the battle for bragging rights  
We were a couple of kindred souls  
Fighting for childish things like control  
  
But it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like the scene of a crime  
It was Real At The Time  
It was Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
We got way out of line  
But it was Real At The Time

Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe  
Flickering inside  
  
I've been around this track  
And the only thing I lack  
Is the real love  
  
Every time I see you, every time we touch  
I can feel the way you feel for me babe  
And it means so much  
  
And every time you look at me  
It's just the way it all should be  
In the real love  
  
Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'  
Stay with me stay  
I long to see you in the morning sun  
Everyday everyday  
  
So until that moment  
When I take your hand  
I'm gonna try to do my very best babe  
To prove that I'm your man  
  
I'm gonna do my very best  
I'm not gonna rest

Bob Seger,Revisionism Street,/b/bob+seger/revisionism+street_20021943.html,"I saw them standing on a corner  
Bathed in ordinary light  
They turned away and started walkin'  
And faded off into the night  
Some years ago they were in fashion  
Tonight they couldn't get a seat  
They've got themselves a brand new history  
From Revisionism Street  
Written on Revisionism Street  
  
The years of sacrifice and struggle  
The arc of stardom's natural course  
The inevitable decline  
The wolves waiting at the door  
""Let's dig up something really nasty""  
""Let's get some clay around their feet""  
""No ones memory is sacred 'round here  
On Revisionism Street""  
  
""We'll never be in the arena""  
""Hey, we'll never have to compete""  
""We'll never write a classic novel""  
""And we'll never have to be discreet!""  
  
Alfred Hitchcock, Isaac Newton  
Elvis Presley, Captain Bligh  
They're heroic or pathetic  
Depending on which book you buy  
Charles Dickens, Jackie Gleason  
Burn 'em all, turn up the heat  
If there's no truth, use innuendo  
This is Revisionism Street  
  
""Let's find ourselves some old acquaintance""  
""Let's see what they have to say""  
""Some disgruntled ex-employee""  
""Presto! Payday!""  
  
A tree falls in the forest  
A million copies go to print  
Some parasitic little feeder  
Sits back and makes a mint  
Somewhere a baby's softly sleeping  
Lt's innocence complete  
Unaware they're workin' late tonight  
On Revisionism Street

It's a change of venue for the lobbyist  
It's a dream of justice buried in the grist  
  
It's a secret briefing based on need to know  
It's a condescending rationale from command control  
Feel the sense of wonder at the overthrow  
  
It's a rite of passage through a hurricane  
Through a rolling thunder through a screaming rain  
Hear the shriek of Abel hear the cry of Cain  
  
And Abraham will take his son  
Five billion years from now the cruelty will be done  
  
Make a destination  
Of the greater truth  
Make 'em hang their heads and eat their words  
When you find the proof  
This is all you're given  
It's your only move  
  
It's a rite of passage for the everyman  
To a higher ground  
To a brighter light  
To a promised land

They will rise and fall again  
Everything must have an end

Like a river to a stream  
Like a river to a stream

And how you tried to make it work  
Did you really think it could  
How you tried to make it last  
Did you really think it would

Now it's finally time to leave  
Yes, it's finally time to leave  
Take it calmly and serene

You were just the last to know  
It's been a long time since you've smiled  
Seems like oh so long ago  
Now the stage has all been set  
And the nights are growing cold  
Soon the winter will be here  
And there's no one warm to hold  
Now the lines have all been read  
And you knew them all by heart  
Now you move toward the door  
Here it comes the hardest part  
Try the handle of the road  
Feeling different feeling strange  
This can never be arranged  
As the light fades from the screen  
From the famous final scene

And we travel separate roads  
And we carry different loads  
And in the end we stay or go

Through fog and rain and far beyond

You turn away it's no surprise

Bob Seger,The Ring,/b/bob+seger/the+ring_20021953.html,"By the light of the moon  
To a 50's tune  
He pledged his love to her  
A girl so rare  
A girl so fair  
The girl for him for sure  
He could see himself getting up every mornin'  
For the rest of his life  
Just to look in those eyes so blue  
It was all he ever wanted to do  
She was all he'd ever need to see him through  
  
They were still in their teens  
When he gave her the ring  
They were married late one May  
And they moved into a little house  
On the far end of town  
Out by the big highway  
And all through the days  
And all through the nights  
The cars and trucks rolled on by  
And he slept through it all just fine  
Every night he slept just fine  
  
Sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window  
Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon  
Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping  
Hoping the dawn would come soon  
  
She'd done well in school  
She'd followed the rules  
And she'd always stood out from the rest  
She'd go off to college  
And work her way through  
Then move to some city out west  
She had it all planned  
She'd have her career  
She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked  
  
She'd wake up one morning all packed  
And leave here and never look back  
  
Most of her friends thought it soon would be over  
Not many thought it would last  
Most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other  
And soon it would pass - soon it would pass  
  
Now twenty years have gone  
And her kids have moved on  
And she's still on the far end of town  
Her youngest - she's livin' somewhere in L. A.  
And her oldest - he works on a nearby farm  
Her husband comes home  
And they talk over supper  
He's usually the first to turn in  
Another day comes to an end  
Another day just ends  
  
And sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down  
She'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing  
And she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture  
But not at the ring - not at the ring  
She never looks at the ring

You try to give away  
As the sweat pours out your body  
Like the music that you play  
  
Later in the evening  
As you lie awake in bed  
With the echoes from the amplifiers  
Ringin' in your head  
You smoke the day's last cigarette,  
Rememberin' what she said

Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing  
Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night  
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  
My next door neighbor Donnie  
Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein  
Cops come down with a body bag  
They said Donnie was a casualty  
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out  
He couldn't handle reality  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything

He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey, hallelujah, baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet

It's different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fire's falling from the sky

Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly

It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from  
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine

They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you  
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver  
They paid you some money to sell them my blood  
  
But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place

Looking for a window in the house of tears

As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire

You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo, like a spirit you can't embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror, and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart

Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay  
Last night we went to bed angry  
We didint mean what we said  
Seems we never get past forgiveness  
We try to hide, we never learn  
To swallow our pride.

When youre misunderstood

It hurts you so good.  
Baby life has no guarantee  
Never knowing where loves gonna lead  
Even through youre a part of me  
We have to deal with our pain separately  
Sometimes we both feel like victims  
With no easy way out not, no, no  
Somehow we stand by each other  
When were desperate, and drowning in  
The shadows of doubt.

Where the love turns to hate

It hurts you so good.

Are the times that keep us alive

can't hurt me nough, to give you up

Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets, calling out my name  
I'm coming home to you, this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs, knocking on the door  
She don't recognize me or want me anymore  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood Dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot Lights  
The spot lights can't bring back you're love to me  
Chasing those Hollywood...

It seems you always wait for life to happen  
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break

And if you're in, you know I'm in

No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing

Bon Jovi,Just Older,/b/bon+jovi/just+older_20022176.html,"Hey, man, it's been a while  
Do you remember me?  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild, a little green  
  
I've been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
I like the bed I'm sleeping in  
It's just like me, it's broken in  
It's not old -- just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin I'm in it's alright with me  
It's not old -- just older  
  
It's good to see your face  
You ain't no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave  
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff  
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose  
  
Well, I look in the mirror  
I don't hate what I see  
There's a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man, I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair  
It's been all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder

I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel

The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything

Then sit down beside your hospital bed

Happy is one thing it's not.  
  
I was jaded, suffocated, it got too hard to breath  
But I never got as high as I needed to be

I just couldn't live with what was left for me  
And I couldn't run far enough from the truth, what's the use  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy's one thing it's not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there can help you stop before you hit the ground  
It's lonely at the top ooh yeah  
  
Tell Franie, I'm sorry I better kiss her when she cries  
I'm sorry I left her, never said good bye  
Didn't mean to leave you all alone but then the music died  
Through the song remains the same, I couldn't live that lie  
You know that ain't too far from the truth  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top

No one there to help you stop before you hit the ground

He was only nineteen  
When was sentenced to die

To read and to write

They had to find  
El Lute  
  
Soon the fame of his tale  
Spread like wild fire  
All over the land  
Were the prize on his head  
People still gave him bread  
And they gave him a hand  
For they knew he was right  
And his fight was their fight

And he robbed where he could

But they caught him in vain  
Cause a change came for Spain  
And El Lute

And then freedom really came to his land

Boney M.,He Was A Steppenwolf,/b/boney+m/he+was+a+steppenwolf_20022501.html,"Come on and listen to my tale  
It's a strange and sorry tale  
That's gonna rock you  
About a man, the drifting kind  
Let the story now unwind  
It's gonna shock you  
  
Some people said he was a ghost  
Wouldn't want to be his host  
Or just to meet him  
And if he ever came their way  
They'd be sticks and stones, I'd say  
That would grieve him  
  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf, with a forgotten past  
He was a steppenwolf, who found a love at last  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
The girl he met was out-of-sight  
Though she walked the streets at night  
He didn't mind it  
She seemed as happy as a song  
And if anything was wrong  
He didn't find it  
  
They used to laugh and dance and drink  
And not ever did he think of a payday  
No matter where they ever were  
Every day he spent with her was a hey-day  
  
He was a steppenwolf, and not a handsome man  
He was a steppenwolf, who didn't know her plan  
He was a steppenwolf, not very bright at all  
He was a steppenwolf, just riding for a fall  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
One day she said ""it's time you knew  
That I started up with you  
For just one reason  
You're gonna do just what I want  
'cause there's something that I want  
And I ain't teasing  
My life is empty all around  
Nothing that I ever found  
Would fulfill me  
So for a while I'll be with you  
When I say that we're through  
You must kill me!""  
  
He was a steppenwolf, he cried ""it isn't fair""  
He was a steppenwolf, ""you know how much I care""  
He was a steppenwolf, she said ""this is the deal""  
He was a steppenwolf, he saw this was for real  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
He was a steppenwolf, they spent a long last night  
He was a steppenwolf, and with a smile she died  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
While shepherds watch their flock by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seem to come from afar.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
""Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace.""  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted

And then I found you  
And we found an eternal love  
Right from the beginning.

The palms swaying under the moon,  
We were swimming out into the  
Crystal sea,  
In that fateful night I thought to  
Myself  
I'll do everthing I can, save  
Every dime,  
And one day I'll return,  
And then I'll stay forever, forever.

Verse 3  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear them there buzzin'  
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening  
And have nothing to say  
  
Chorus Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
To believe in this livin'

You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show  
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake  
Everything in return, you just preserve her  
When you serve her a little tenderness  
If she's a woman, she'll try to make it last  
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast  
There's no reason here, no treason here  
Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name  
She has no shame, she just loves you  
It's not easy to undo what's done  
Or to speak too freely to just anyone  
And if this takes more than you bargained for  
Boy it's time you learn, not to talk so loud  
Walk so proud when you're comin' on

After the day that I've had  
I don't believe I'm able  
You give me every little reason in the book  
But there's one thing that I think you've overlooked  
You say you're tired, well so am I  
Baby you've got to try and  
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby  
Meet halfway if you want to get it right  
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby  
Meet halfway in the middle of the night  
Our love is kind of stalled, baby  
  
But it ain't about the sex  
I'd trade the roses and the negligees  
If we could just connect  
I go deeper when you look into my eyes  
There's a place where neither one of us can hide  
And it's up to us to reinvent the game  
Love it when you call my name and  
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby  
Meet halfway, and we're halfway home  
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby  
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone

From the bed I can't get used to

As I spend my first night alone without you  
  
Honey, half of me has gone away  
With all the love I learned to cling to  
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way  
To live the rest of my life alone without you  
  
You taught me how to live  
How to be myself  
And how to give  
Oh, but now it's you  
Who's given up on giving  
  
You've lost the thing, no one to teach  
Changing and now you're out of reach  
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living  
No, no  
  
I've been sitting learning how to read  
Cause back in school I never liked to  
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need  
As I put my life together, baby, without you

Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching his restless day  
  
He turns from his window to me  
Sad smile his apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
Still he spares me words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind  
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's a world you know  
There's a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To lock you safe behind it's open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see  
Now my kind words find their way back to me  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's world you know  
Got a way to go

Pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside

And I watch their bodies change  
I know they see the same in me,

With so much more at stake.  
Life gets mighty precious when there's less of it to waste.

Scared to run out of time.  
  
Just when I thought I'd had enough  
And all my tears were shed  
No promise left unbroken,  
There were no painful words unsaid.  
You came along and showed me  
How to leave it all behind  
You opened up my heart again and then much to my surprise.

I guess I wasn't listening

Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
With my own hands  
I fashioned this frame  
And into the wood  
I carved out my name

But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made

In the bed I made

If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast  
He's got a lot of what they call the most  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze  
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it  
  
If he mesmerizes each and every one  
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done  
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twenty one  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if I got to go down to him on bended knees  
It's because I'm hoping, obviously  
That some day his answer will be  
The boy can't help it  
He's in love with me.

Am fine but my friends don't agree  
They say I'm not the one I used to  
Be And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder Why I'm smiling all the time  
The only thing I have inside my mind  
Is a picture of you And it's there no  
Matter what I do No matter what I  
Do not know...  
  
I don't know what it is but I think I'm  
Falling in love I don't know what it is  
But when I close my eyes You're the  
One I'm dreaming of I don't know  
What it is but I'm floating in the sky  
I don't know what it is and I sure  
Don't know how But you filled  
My heart with butterflies I'm falling in  
Love...  
  
Seems like all my problems went  
Away I start to make the most of  
Everyday So I spend them with you  
No one makes me feel the way you  
Do And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder about the pain I get inside  
Everytime you're not by my side  
You have opened a door  
I have never felt this way before  
And I want more I don't know....  
  
I don't know what it is....  
  
When we are walking I get to hold  
Your hand And that is making me  
Proud, I'm screaming out loud  
I, I am a happy man  
  
And when we are looking up on a  
Clear blue shy You give me a kiss, I  
Wonder who is THIS LUCKY GUY...

When the whether bothers me,  
I empty draws of other summers,  
Where my shadows used to be,  
She is standing by the water,  
As her smile begins to curl,  
In this or any other summer,  
She is something all together different,  
Never just an ordanairy girl.  
And in the evenings on Long Island,  
When the colours start to fade,  
She wears a silly yellow hat,  
That someone gave her when she stayed,  
I didn't think that she returned it,  
We left New York in a whirl,  
Time expands and then contracts,  
When you are spinning in the grips of someone,  
Who is not an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep, you find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning covers you with light,  
And it makes you feel alright,  
But its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
You send your lover off to China,  
Then you awit for her to call,  
You put your girl upon a pedestal,  
And you wait fro her to fall,  
I put my summers back in a letter,  
And I hide it from the world,  
All the regrets you can't forget,  
Are somehow pressed upon the picture,  
In the face of such an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep,  
You find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in thee dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning showers you with light,  
But its just the same hard candy, your remembering again,  
Again, again, again, again.  
And its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
  
Go ask her to come around,  
And see me late, after dark,  
Don't ask me to go around,  
And wait to see if theres a spark X2

Bread,You Can't Measure The Cost,/b/bread/you+cant+measure+the+cost_20024012.html,"The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize

Never ever has there been  
Nor will ever be again  
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be  
Your friend  
Hanging on till the bitter end  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.  
  
I've tried to look inside myself  
To find the strength from which to draw from  
The view she saw from.  
Since she tried to go too deep  
Limitations brought her down  
And though I'd like to free her mind  
Visitations bring a frown  
I gotta find the place she found  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.  
Where she is no one seems to know  
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.  
  
The morning mist that melts upon the meadow  
Brings a touch of sorrow  
The one I kissed is all alone  
And may or may not know tomorrow.  
Just an ordinary girl  
To the ordinary eye  
But so much deeper goes the vein  
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch  
Then you gotta hold  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show

It may be quite simple but now that it's done

I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean

The love of your life

Britney Spears,Lucky,/b/britney+spears/lucky_20024636.html,"This is a story about a girl named Lucky  
  
Early morning, she wakes up  
Knock, knock, knock on the door  
It's time for make-up, perfect smile  
It's you they're all waiting for  
They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"" And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
She's so lucky, she's a star  
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking  
If there's nothing missing in my life  
Then why do these tears come at night?  
  
Lost in an image, in a dream  
But there's no one there to wake her up  
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning  
But tell me what happens when it stops?  
They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""  
And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!""  
""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky.""  
""Oh my god, here she comes!""  
  
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?  
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?  
If there's nothing missing in her life  
Why do tears come at night?

(You want a piece of me)  
  
I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'  
Tryin' and pissin' me off  
Well get in line with the paparazzi  
Who's flippin' me off  
Hopin' I'll resort to startin' havoc  
And end up settlin' in court  
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?  
I'm Mrs. 'Most likely to get on TV for strippin' on the streets'  
When getting the groceries, no, for real  
Are you kidding me?  
No wonder there's panic in the industry,  
I mean please  
  
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Exta! Extra! this just in  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17  
Don't matter if I step on the scene  
Or sneak away to the Philippines  
They still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazine  
You want a piece of me?  
You want a piece of me  
You want a piece of me?  
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's shameless!  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's shameless!  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in  
(You want a piece of me)  
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin  
(You want a piece of me)  
Oh yeah  
You want a piece of me

Hey Prince Charming  
You can kiss my ass  
I don't want cha or your fairy tales  
I want a Dark Night  
Who can rough me up  
Whose middle name is dangerous  
  
I don't want guarantees  
I don't want promises  
I just want a ride baby I'll never forget  
Got no expectations  
No need for a conversation  
Leave the drama out and just get right down to it  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Verse 2:  
I'm talking damage  
With mystery  
I'll keep ya company tonight  
You bring the leather  
I'll bring the lace  
I'll wear it safe tonight  
I don't want future plans  
You can keep your romance  
You can give it to me baby  
Dying on ice  
We can make memories  
If you'll remember me  
You can have a shot  
Have a piece of lime
