I sometimes wonder if this spell that I'm under,  
Can only be a melody for I know no one but me,  
Has won your heart but when the music starts:  
My peace departs,  
From the moment they play that lovely strain  
And we surrender to all it's charm again.  
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain.  
We dance to a tango of love.  
Your heart beats with mine as we sway.  
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of:  
That soft word your cruel lips will never say.  
Well, I fear that the music will end,  
And shatter the spell it may lend.  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive,  
It's only a tango you love.

But, darling, don't cry over me:

Young woman abused  
You must understand  
It's never too late to, lose who you are  
And choose who you are supposed to be  
Supposed to become  
You've been in and out  
Up and down, back and forth  
Backwards around  
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father  
Just God and you should make a choice  
What you ought to do  
What matters most  
Who you are to you  
Opinions of the old and young  
Shouldn't matter to you  
Take advice think it over twice  
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night  
It's decent, but recently  
Things have shown us  
We have done the wrong things often  
Never suicide, that's the easy route  
There's always another way out  
Think about it (think about it)

Verse 2:  
Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed  
You never would'a known there was a high road  
  
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them  
Instead of bein' mad at yourself  
You're only number one in your life  
And you will decide if it goes right  
Every time you digress  
Defeat your progress  
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest  
The controversy yo can get personal  
They don't understand till the role reversal  
Seekin' fame, play their games  
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain  
Push comes to shove  
Do you push or shove?  
When the choice is yours  
Do you leave or you love?  
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside  
When will you decide to survive

She must have come from the sun (I've got too much stuff)

I can feel it on the tip of your tongue.  
  
And I feel alive.  
  
We met up once we'd settled the sun  
Between the heat and the work week  
The fear is we could use some sleep  
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds  
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight.

I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block  
That asks if I've had enough, and aloud I say ""I've had too much,""  
When the truth is, I'm just getting started.

And one of us has nothing at all.

Or when I found out one day I'm gonna die  
If only I could find my people or my place in life  
A when they come a'carolin'  
So loud, so bright, the theremin  
Will lead us to a chorus  
Where we'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes:

Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.

Just walking, thinking fondly of you  
Thinking how the worst is yet to come  
When from that street corner came a song  
And I can't remember the man,  
The panhandler or his melody.  
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change I'd given thee.  
  
Oh be calm.

Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.

A song that we all knew

Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright""

And I began to sing along  
Then across the frozen battlefield  
Another's voice joined in  
Until one by one each man became  
A singer of the hymn  
Then I thought that I was dreaming  
For right there in my sight  
Stood the German soldier  
'Neath the falling flakes of white  
And he raised his hand and smiled at me  
As if he seemed to say  
Here's hoping we both live  
To see us find a better way  
Then the devil's clock struck midnight  
And the skies lit up again  
And the battlefield where heaven stood  
Was blown to hell again  
But for just one fleeting moment  
The answer seemed so clear  
Heaven's not beyond the clouds  
It's just beyond the fear  
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds

Garth Brooks,Callin Baton Rouge,/g/garth+brooks/callin+baton+rouge_20057977.html,"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana  
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her  
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child  
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind  
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine  
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes  
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Operator, won't you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
  
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine  
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time  
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime

Hurry up, won't you put her on the line

Garth Brooks,Cowboy Bill,/g/garth+brooks/cowboy+bill_20058039.html,"He told a good story  
And all us kids listened  
'Bout his life on the border  
And the way it was then  
  
And we all believed  
And when he would finish  
We'd ask the old cowboy  
To tell 'em again  
  
You could almost hear  
Those prairie winds blowing  
His saddle a creakin'  
Beneath his old faded jeans  
  
You could taste the dry dust  
From the trail he was ridin'  
As he sat there and painted  
Those west Texas scenes  
  
And the grown-ups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
He told of a time  
When he rode with the rangers  
Down on the pecos  
And he saved the day  
  
Outnumbered by plenty  
They were almost to cover  
With thirty banditos  
Headed their way  
  
He looked back just in time  
To see a horse stumble  
The captain went down  
And Bill pulled up on his reigns  
  
Through a flurry of bullets  
He rescued the captain  
They rode for the sunset  
Just the story remains  
  
And the grown-ups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
Well I still remember  
The day that it happened  
We waited and we waited  
But Bill never showed  
  
The folks at the feed store  
Said they hadn't seen him  
So we set out for his place  
Down on old grist mill road  
  
And we cried when we found him  
Lying there with his memories  
The old trunk wide open  
Things scattered about  
  
He was clutching a badge  
That said Texas Rangers  
And an old yellow letter  
Said ""Texas is Proud""  
  
And the grown-ups that told us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
Now... they're all saying  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.

Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud

And listened as that cowboy prayed  
God took passion and thunder  
Patience and wonder then He sent down  
The best thing that God ever made

For you will find them together today  
And only heaven above them knows why she loves him

Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight

I got a funny feeling down deep inside  
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin  
Yes I do think about you every now and then

I love my life and I've never trade  
Between what you and me had and the life I've made  
She's here and she's real, but you were too  
and every once in a while I think about you  
  
I heard a song on the radio just yesterday  
The same one you always asked me to play  
And when the song was over  
I wished they played it again  
Yes I do think about you every now and then

Talkin' to my heart and trying to explain

His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame  
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by  
He offers salvation from the savior on high  
  
His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks  
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks  
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold  
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold  
  
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand  
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man  
  
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions won't matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing  
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on  
  
'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more  
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

And he believes in me  
And his faith is strong  
I'd never fall  
Or even compromise

I'm seein' you  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
Starin' back at me  
I see a sinkin' soul  
Tryin' desperately  
To turn the tide  
Before it dies  
In another's eyes  
And what they don't see  
Is killing me  
It's blessing and a curse  
That love is blind

Garth Brooks,In Lonesome Dove,/g/garth+brooks/in+lonesome+dove_20058123.html,"She was a girl on a wagon train  
Haded west across the plains  
The train got lost in a summer storm  
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home  
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain  
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train  
And she looked down and her heart was gone  
The train went west but she stayed on  
In Lonesome Dove  
  
A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand  
A blooming rose in a bed of sand  
She loved the man who wore a star  
A Texas Ranger known near and far  
So they got married and they had a child  
But times were touch and the West was wild  
So it was no surprise the day she learned  
That her Texas man would not return  
To Lonesome Dove  
  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove  
  
She watched her boy grow into a man  
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand  
He wore his star for all to see  
He was a Texas lawman legacy  
The one day word blew into town  
It seemed the men that shot his father down  
Had robbed a bank in Cherico  
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico  
Was Lonesome Dove  
  
The shadows stretched across the land  
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande  
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street  
The men lay at the ranger's feet  
But legend tells to this very day  
That shots were comin' from an alleyway  
Though no one knows who held the gun  
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone  
In Lonesome Dove  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

They all joined hands and they bowed their heads

And swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground

And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it

And you know it's not like she's forgot about him  
She's just dealing with the pain  
And the fact that she's survived so well without him  
You know it's driving him insane  
And the crazy thing about it  
Is she'd take him back  
But the fool in him that walked out  
Is the fool who just won't ask  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled

Busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style

Feeling like Christmas  
Children laughing,  
People passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every  
Street corner you hear  
Silver bells,  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling,  
Hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home  
With their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch  
See the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all the  
Bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day

He barely beat the rain in from the field

""Damn this rain and damn this wasted day""  
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long  
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on  
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while  
When their eyes met, they both began to smile  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care  
She wants to know she's needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night  
  
They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket  
On the front porch swing  
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things  
And there are times she feels alone even by his side  
It was the first time she ever saw him cry  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care

Garth Brooks,Standing Outside The Fire,/g/garth+brooks/standing+outside+the+fire_20058069.html,"We call them cool  
Those hearts that have no scars to show  
The ones that never do let go  
And risk it the tables being turned  
  
We call them fools  
Who have to dance within the flame  
Who chance the sorrow and the shame  
That always come with getting burned  
  
But you got to be tough when consumed by desire  
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire  
We call them strong  
Those who can face this world alone  
Who seem to get by on their own  
Those who will never take the fall  
  
We call them weak  
Who are unable to resist  
The slightest chance love might exist  
And for that forsake it all  
  
They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire  
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire  
  
[Chorus:]  
Standing outside the fire  
Standing outside the fire  
Life is not tried it is merely survived  
If you're standing outside the fire  
  
There's this love that is burning  
Deep in my soul  
Constantly yearning to get out of control  
Wanting to fly higher and higher  
I can't abide standing outside the fire

Garth Brooks,The Gift,/g/garth+brooks/the+gift_20057970.html,"A poor orphan girl named Maria  
Was walking to market one day  
She stopped for a rest by the roadside  
Where a bird with a broken wing lay  
A few moments passed till she saw it  
For it's feathers were covered with sand  
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling  
In the warmth of Maria's small hand  
  
She happily gave her last peso  
On a cage made of rushes and twine  
She fed it loose corn from the market  
And watched it grow stronger with time  
  
Now the Christmas Eve service was coming  
And the church shone with tinsel and light  
And all of the townfolk brought presents  
To lay by the manger that night  
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes  
In packages fit for a king  
But for one ragged bird in a small cage  
Maria had nothing to bring  
  
She waited till just before midnight  
So no one could see her go in  
And crying she knelt by the manger  
For her gift was unworthy of Him  
  
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness  
Maria, what brings you to me  
If the bird in the cage is your offering  
Open the door, let me see  
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her  
And out of the cage the bird flew  
Soaring into the rafters  
On a wing that had healed good as new  
  
Just then the midnight bells rang out  
And the little bird started to sing  
A song that no words could recapture  
Whose beauty was fit for a king  
  
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen  
To that cascade of notes sweet and long  
As her offering was lifted to heaven  
By the very first nightingale's song

Their first time to lie together  
They were finally where desire dared them to go  
Both belonging to another  
But longing to be lovers  
Promising each other that the night will only know  
Parked on some old backstreet  
They laid down in the back seat  
And fell into the fire down below  
But they would pay for their deceiving  
For a deadly web was weaving  
Why they picked that spot that evening  
Lord, the night will only know  
Well within the innuendos  
Just outside the steamy windows  
The night was shattered by a woman's scream  
Motionless and frightened  
The grip of fate had tightened  
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam  
They saw a woman pleading  
Stumbling, begging and retreating'  
Til she became the victim of her foe  
And they watched her fall in silence  
To save their own alliance  
But the reason for the violence  
Just the night will only know  
And every paper ran the story  
She was stripped of all her glory  
And the told exactly how the woman died  
Abandoned and forsaken  
Too many pills were taken  
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide  
Bound by their behavior  
They could have been her savior  
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe  
But another crime was committed  
And it's never been admitted  
Have the guilty been acquitted  
Lord, the night will only know

Playing music, never sleeping and working on a neon tan

For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park  
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark

About the buckboard bear creek cowboys and the grizzly rose  
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale  
A tornado nearly stole the show  
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll

It was one big party, Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you

Taking on the world alone  
Next date, can't wait, tearing up the interstate  
Every place we played was home  
Balls out, no doubt this is what it's all about  
Beggin' for a place to play  
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends  
Wouldn't trade a single day

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times  
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine  
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then  
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs  
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care

There wasn't much we could recall  
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  
  
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife  
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord  
For the gifts in my life

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...  
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

But that was years ago  
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder  
But where she's now I don't know  
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year  
That spins my head around  
Takes me back makes me wonder  
What she's doin now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now  
  
Just for laughs I dialed her old number  
But no one knew her name  
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered  
If she'd ever done the same  
I took a walk in the evenin' wind  
To clear my head somehow  
But tonight I lie here thinkin'  
What she doin' now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows

I couldn't begin to describe how it goes  
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud  
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around  
This is the man that nobody sees  
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me  
Just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd  
He's the man that I am when there's no one around  
It's four in the morning  
I'm lyin' in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin' inside my head  
It's heartaches and hard knocks  
And things I don't know  
I listen and I wonder  
Where will it go  
This is a glimpse of the child that's within  
He's so immature but he's still my best friend  
If he could learn how to fly he'd never touch down  
He's the kid that I am when there's no one around  
This is the dance I do every day  
I let my feet go and get carried away  
I let my soul lead and follow the sound  
It's the dance that I do when there's no one around  
It's four in the morning  
I'm lyin' in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin' inside my head

And I'm lonely

And I missed you tonight

Look inside. Do you feel anything but bitter?  
Anything but sad and lost?  
Look inside. Do you dream of a time that's better?  
Do you ever dream of me?  
And my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep.  
So I can't wait here hoping I'm something you'll keep.

Sometimes words don't say the things you mean  
Sometimes you can't explain the way you feel  
Sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie  
  
With a whisper, everything you know  
Is torn away and life just stops  
With a whisper, everything you are  
Just falls apart and dies  
  
And all those things that you meant to change  
Are thoughts lost on the way to this  
And all those sorries you never said  
Are words lost on the wind  
  
Did you ever wonder about the end?  
Did you ever you wish that I was still there?  
Did you ever call my name by mistake?  
Did you ever cry yourself to sleep?  
  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the love that binds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the care that holds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the time that shares us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the heart to save us

Sometimes friends are not the friends they seem  
Sometimes time is not the cure it seems

There's nothing much to keep us alive, but 'Dance'.  
All that she can say is goodbye. All things change I suppose  
We'll sing without voice, without heart and leave no address  
I well never ever see you again. I know.

Making love as lovely as she.  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.

Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.

Same sorrow and pain  
We laugh and we cry  
We are low and then we get high  
And then we look, and we search  
And we seek to put the pieces  
Of the puzzle together  
Doing our best to keep it all together  
Going 'bout our business  
Seldom thinking of one another  
Hey that's not the only way  
That's the way of the world  
  
Ooh...Yeah...

When in your mind  
You just felt like giving up  
Wanting to surrender  
You've been tryin' to find your way  
Hopin' that tomorrow would be better  
Much better than today  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home

They say it's the year 2000  
Judgment day will come  
The grand finale, comin' to take you over  
It's the King Almighty, please...  
Forgive us of our sins  
  
Bless us with all your heart  
  
And give me wisdom so I can preach  
All your words to every man, woman  
And child walkin' on the streets  
I ain't got no beef with all ya wanna be  
Ambitious scheming minds  
Read the Bible I suggest and you shall find  
  
Who knows what may happen tomorrow  
Don't fear if you know who you follow  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Never will He leave you alone  
In your heart is where He'll make His home  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
Who knows what tomorrow may bring  
Fear not if you follow the King  
He takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Keeping it high  
Clapping my hands, look in my eye  
Am I telling a lie? No, Let's keep it real  
  
We've come together on this special day  
To sing our message loud and clear  
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days  
Future pass, they disappear  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home  
If you look in the right place

The one who created you, the earth and the sky  
I'm a baptized disciple, so I shall not tell a lie  
I've got the Holy Spirit, now I'm flyin' high  
Now while I'm rippin' a record take a second  
Do me a favor (make the Lord Jesus Christ your saviour)

On my chest - I was a mess  
But now I'm blessed  
By the Lord Jesus Christ being in my life  
Now I'm a whole new guy  
Go tell 'em that's why

Maybe you want the same - that's why  
Maybe you'd better call upon His name

Well can you feel me?

The giving of ourselves  
And what that means  
On a dark and cloudy day  
A man hung crying in the rain  
All because of love, all because of love

He'd left and let nobody know.  
Gone were the towers he had known from a child,  
Alone with the dream of a life  
He traveled the wide open road,  
The blinkered arcade,  
In search of another to share in his life.  
Nowhere.  
Everyone looked so strange to him.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And wept as they led him away to a cage  
Beast that can talk, read the sign.  
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame  
And questioned his story again.  
But soon they grew bored of their prey  
Beast that can talk?  
More like a freak or publicity stunt.  
Oh  
No.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out.  
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out:  
There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination  
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.  
Let me take you there, show you a living story  
Let me show you others such as me  
Why did I ever leave?  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
And wept.  
  
And so we set out with the best and his horns  
And his crazy description of home.  
After many days journey we came to a peak  
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out.  
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw  
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,  
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance  
  
Hello friend, welcome home.

To want to steal a pin then I'll check that I have skin  
Am I very wrong  
To want to leave my friends and the curse of the happiness machine

Everything all right  
Let us our greetings to you send  
Happy friend

Genesis,Back In N.Y.C.,/g/genesis/back+in+n+y+c_20058846.html,"No-one seems to take up the chase, and with the familiar faces fresh in his
mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much
time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little
speed. He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa had
taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack.  
  
I see faces and traces of home back in New York City -  
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?  
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.  
The call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor  
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain  
'Cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong,  
As the weakest link in the chain.  
  
Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the
gang.  
  
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,  
I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.  
  
You say I must be crazy, 'cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.  
But I know it's me that's hitting out and I'm, I'm not full of shit.  
I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong.  
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.  
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,  
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.  
  
Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.  
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair,  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!  
Off we go...  
  
Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,  
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.  
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,  
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.  
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,  
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured  
Sheets).  
Who needs illusion of love and affection  
When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?  
Connection.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair.  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!

In the saloon one evening Big took a bet  
With a rancher whose name I forget  
He wanted a herd taken over the plain  
And he called Jim ""yellow"", he'll never do that again  
  
He got mad!  
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out  
He's gonna give it a try, he left no doubt  
  
""Must be mad, must be mad""!  
The people wished him well, and good luck  
""Hell, I don't need it""! He laughed , got on  
His horse and rode away  
  
Over on the trail, Jim 'n' his crew of five  
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive  
The weather was hard, but so were the men  
Though I don't think even Jim'll try this trip again  
  
His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead  
But the trouble didn't start till the men were in bed  
A-whooping and a-hollering and flashing their knives  
Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe  
  
  
He was scared, Big Jim was scared  
Alive, they called him lucky, but not today  
Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men  
  
Big Jim, he still won't lie down  
For him the bet is still on  
Some say he rides there, cursing still  
Some say they've seen him

Absorbs them effortlessly claiming.  
  
They told of one who tired of all singing,  
""Praise him, praise him.""  
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried,  
""By our command, waters retreat,  
Show my power, halt at my feet,""  
But the cause was lost,  
Now cold winds blow.  
  
For from the north overcast ranks advance  
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn.  
The waves surround the sinking throne  
Singing ""Crown him, crown him,""  
""Those who love our majesty show themselves!""  
All bent their knees.  
  
But he forced a smile even though  
His hopes lay dashed where offerings fell (where they fell).  
""Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile.""

And soon they dared to laugh.

Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep

I didn't stop to see what I had done  
I had to keep on driving deep into the night  
The miles between would somehow put it right  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
All my life you lie silently there  
All my life in a world so unfair  
All my life and only I'll know why  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes  
Please open your eyes  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
Heard it on the radio, saw it on TV  
But could I take my secret to the grave  
If I had another chance, would I do the same  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Are you dreaming while you sleep ?  
  
All my life I'll be haunted by  
All my life just one moment in time  
All my life until the day I die  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life

Not knowing what lay ahead  
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears  
Remembering all we'd said  
  
I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers  
I asked Him for guidance and strength  
But the simple beliefs of a simple man  
Lay in His hands, and on my head  
My head  
  
I gave everything that they wanted  
But still they wanted more  
We sweat and we toiled  
Good men lost their lives  
I don't think they knew what for  
  
I sold them my heart  
I sold them my soul  
I gave everything I had

Fightback  
Just fightback

We were digging the tunnels, shifting the earth

Stone fell like rain  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Can you breathe  
  
The smoke cleared, the dust it settled  
No one knew how many had died  
All around there were broken men  
They'd said it was safe, and they'd lied  
You could hear the cries, you could smell the fear  
But good fortune that day was mine  
And it occurred to me that the heart of a good man  
It seems is hard to find  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Don't you see  
How we worked, how we worked like  
The devil for our pay  
Through the wind, through the snow  
And through the rain  
  
Blasting and cutting through Gods country like a knife  
Sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life  
  
But I can hear my children's cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Memories of those I've left behind  
Oh just still ringing in my ears  
Will I ever go back again  
Will I ever see her face again  
'cause I'll always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We came from the North  
And we came from the South  
With picks and with spades  
And a new kind of order  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
They'll never see the likes of us again  
  
Driving the last spike  
Lifting and laying the track  
With blistering hands  
And the sun burning your back  
  
But I can hear my children's cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Oh memories of those I've left behind  
Still ringing in my ears  
'cause I'll always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We followed the rail, we slept under the stars  
Digging in darkness and living with danger  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
They'll never see the likes of us again

Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.

When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light,

Beckoning the trees

Mimicking the breeze

The face turns features are burning.

See the fifteen going by,  
Tell the Lairds and the Lords  
They're running backwards today,  
And once again you stand alone.  
  
Bury your memories bury your friends,  
Leave it alone for a year or two.  
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,  
Then do it again. Some Things never end.

Flowing in the drains  
As the people run their lives  
As their lives are run by time  
Fighting enemies with weapons made to kill  
Death is easy as a substitute for pride  
Victors join together, happy in their bed  
Leaving cold outside the children of the dead

Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,

I can feel your eyes go through me,  
But I don't know why.  
  
I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,  
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,  
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to  
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said,

In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.  
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,  
But they'll fight the battle on.  
  
Then one whose faith had died  
Fled back up the mountainside,  
But before the top was made,  
A misplaced footfall made him stray  
From the path prepared for him.  
Off of the mountain,  
On to a wilderness of ice.  
  
This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,  
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.  
Terror filled their minds with awe.  
  
Simple were the folk who lived  
Upon this frozen wave.  
So not surprising was their thought,  
This is he, God's chosen one,  
Who's come to save us from  
All our oppressors.  
We shall be kings on this world.

They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.  
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.  
Still he urged the people on.  
  
Then, on a distant slope,  
He observed one without hope  
Flee back up the mountainside.

Stood up, and vanished into air

Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand  
Pulls you down on your knees

That it's the last time you'll look like today

Gone to the other side  
Sail away, sail away

Is sinking fast, that happens you know  
The water gets below  
Seems not very long ago  
Lovelier she was than any that I know  
  
Angels never know it's time  
To close the book and gracefully decline  
The song has found a tale  
My, what a jealous pool she is

Genesis,The Day The Light Went Out,/g/genesis/the+day+the+light+went+out_20058927.html,"When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed  
That in the morning light would not be there  
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man  
No place was there known to have been spared  
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom  
Nothing out of reach could be observed  
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day  
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit  
Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
""Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue.""  
  
Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find  
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark  
It seemed the sun was still somewhere, though hidden from their sight  
By something, though amorphous, yet alive  
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
""Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue.""  
  
They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun  
By blasting with their missiles through the dark  
But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone  
Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe  
And when the darkness chose to disappear, not many had survived  
Then came a shadow - another had arrived  
And again the light went out of the daytime sky

But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it  
And then you wonder why you fall  
It cuts through the heart of every city  
If you climb to the top of the highest building  
You can see where it falls 'cause the streetlights stop  
The colors start to change  
You hear a voice inside you  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
In the comfort and safety of your own home  
Remember those outside in the cold  
And the wind and the rain  
And take in your hands a little ray of light  
And turn it into a beam that pierces the darkness of the night  
  
There has always been a dividing line  
But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it  
Sometimes we believe if we close our eyes  
The rain might wash it away  
That's why we stumble and we fall  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
When everything that you hold dear to you  
Has finally faded away from your life  
The last cold ray of sunshine slowly disappears  
Round the corner of the building  
And leaves you alone  
When darkness covers the city and the streets are silent too  
What will you turn to

Come to lure him to demons lair.  
  
Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads  
To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home.

In the forest in a glade.

So glad you saw fit to pay a call.  
  
Some men never listen,  
And others never learn,  
But why this man did as he did  
Only he will ever know.  
  
He knew he was walking  
Into a waiting trap,  
Neatly set up for him  
With a bait so richly wrapped.  
  
So he went inside there to take on what he found  
But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires?  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
I'll give you wine and food too

We all know whatever they say  
Time is on our side  
This world has been here before just going round and round and round  
  
We all agree as far as we can see  
It's just the way of the world  
That's how it's meant to be  
There's right and there's wrong  
There's weak and there's strong  
It's just the way of the world  
And that's how it's meant to be  
  
Take the motion from a spinning wheel and watch it stop  
Take the danger out of a naked flame and what have you got  
If you take the anger out of a broken heart, you feel no pain  
Could you swear if you had that second chance you wouldn't do it again  
  
Why is there blue sky  
Why is there red sky  
Now's the time to ask the reason  
Should the blue sky  
Meet the red sky  
Should the rules have to change at all  
We all know whatever they say

This world has been here before just going round and round and round

Genesis,White Mountain,/g/genesis/white+mountain_20058906.html,"Thin hung the web like a trap in a cage,  
The fox lay asleep in his lair  
Fang's frantic paws told the tale of his sin.  
Far off the chase shrieked revenge.  
  
Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread,  
The last sacred haunt of the dead.  
He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know,  
The sceptre and crown of the king.  
Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack,  
Plunging through forests and snow-storm.  
  
Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky,  
Fang sped through the jungles of ice.  
Hard on his tale, One-eye drew from the pack  
An old hero conquered by none.  
  
Steep, for too steep grew the pathway ahead  
Descent was the only escape  
A wolf never flees in the face of his foe  
Fang knew the price he would pay  
One-eye stood before him  
With the crown upon his head  
Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow.  
  
Fang, son of great Fang, the Traitor we seek,  
The laws of the Brethren say this  
That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods  
And he, the Usurper must die  
  
Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe  
But Fang fought the hero in vain  
Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red  
Never would the crown leave again  
One-eye hid the crown and with laurels on his head  
Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace.

It won't be long till I make my pile, then I'll live in the grandest style.  
I'll be a Cotton King yes sir, I'll be the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
I'll have a retinue ten miles long, and an army ten million strong  
Big white elephants, by the score, and a fleet at anchor off the Wigan shore  
Don't you recognize who I am? You've got to give me a big salaam.  
You've got to end with a vote of thanks, to the Emperor Of Lancs...  
  
Now bow down everyone here I come, bang that cymbal and hit that drum.  
Bow down everyone, yes sir, I'm the Emperor Of Lancashire.  
  
Who's this gentleman flashing dough?  
Is he somebody we should know?  
Is he somebody? Woah sir! I'm Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Who's this gentleman talking loud? Is he one of the usual crowd?  
Who's this gentleman? Yes sir! I'm the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Don't you recognise who you've seen? He's the boss of the whole chabine.  
He's the fellow who broke the banks.  
That's me, I'm the Emperor of Lancs.

Now I'm going back to my native town, with my millions I'll knock 'em down  
I'll have everything in my power and I'll build a palace on the Blackpool

On my birthday the crowds will cheer, all the fountains will flow with beer.  
Blackpool wakes will run all year, for the Emperor Of Lancashire

Stewed pigs trotters, aye and mutton shanks for the Emperor of Lancs.

George Formby,They Laughed When I Started To Play,/g/george+formby/they+laughed+when+i+started+to+play_20795316.html,"Now when I learned to play the ukulele,  
I used to practice day and night.  
My pals all roared as I fumbled at a chord,  
But I couldn't get the darned thing right.  
  
They laughed when I started to play, they laughed so hearty.  
Only two lessons I had, I went up the scale and down the scale,  
It wasn't so bad  
But one chap, he said ""Oh what a mug, why you can't learn that way""  
He took the uke off me and said ""Now I'll have a try""  
Just then the 'g' string bust and flew right into his eye.  
He laughed when I started to play, but he didn't laugh again all day  
  
Oh they laughed when I started to play, oh they laughed so hearty  
Strip poker that's a good game,  
Once I lost my trousers to a gambling dame  
But when, I started shuffling the cards, then the luck came my way.  
I won a frock and undies, she was left I declare  
As bare as any savage and as savages are bear  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.  
  
Now once I watched a game of water polo,  
With players from a ladies school.  
The girls all cried ""Won't you make up a side?""  
So I dashed into the bathing pool.  
They laughed when I started to play, oh how they laughed so hearty.  
In goal, I paddled about, a big ball in the water soon I started to clout.  
Each time, that it came bobbing back, well I smacked it away.  
Just then the ball turned over and a girl said ""No larks"",  
""Seven times you've hit me where I can't show the marks.""  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.

Some like to mix up with a crowd, some like to be alone  
It's no one else's business as far as I can see  
But every time that I go out the people stare at me  
  
With my little ukulele in my hand, of course the people do not understand  
Some say why don't you be a scout, why don't you read a book?  
But I get lots more pleasure when I'm playing with my uke.  
  
Of course I take no notice you can tell  
For mother's sound advice will always stand.  
She said ""My boy do what I say and you'll never go astray  
If you keep your ukulele in your hand, yes son  
Keep your ukulele in your hand. ""  
  
While walking down the prom last night as peaceful as can be  
When some young girl said ""what about a stroll down by the sea?""  
She said her name was Jane and that she'd just come for the day.  
She looked so young and harmless that I couldn't turn away  
  
So with my little ukulele in my hand, I took a stroll with Jane along the
sand.  
We walked along for miles without a single care or frown  
But when we reached the sand hills she said ""Come on let's sit down.""  
I felt so shy and bashful sitting there, 'cause the things I said she didn't
understand  
She said ""Your love just turns me dizzy, come along big boy get busy""  
But I kept my ukulele in my hand, yes sir, I kept my ukulele in my hand.  
  
Made up my mind that I'd get wed some eighteen months ago.  
I also bought a book about the things you want to know.  
But just about a week ago I got a awful fright,  
I had to get dressed quickly in the middle of the night.  
  
And with my little ukulele in my hand, I ran along the road for Dr. Brand  
It didn't take him long to get his little bag of tools.  
I held his hat and coat and let him have my book of rules.  
Out of the bedroom door he looked and smiled  
  
He said, ""Come inside and see your wife and child.""  
My heart it jumped with joy, I could see it was a boy  
For he had a ukulele in his hand, oh baby  
He had a ukulele in his hand.

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been, my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,  
Its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin,  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin,  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin,  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,  
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin,  
Heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin,  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin,  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony,  
I met a white man who walked a black dog,  
I met a young woman whose body was burning,  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,  
I met one man who was wounded in love,  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,  
Its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, whatll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And whatll you do now, my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin back out fore the rain starts a-fallin,  
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest,  
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,  
The executioners face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,  
Where black is the color and none is the number,  
And Ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,  
Reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,  
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinkin,  
But Ill know my song well before I start singin,  
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard,  
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall.  
  
Its a hard rains a gonna fall

Now in the world of light  
Where the spirit free of lies  
And all else that we despised  
  
They've forgotten all about God  
He's the only reason we exist  
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird

I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I want to cross you off my list  
But when you come knocking at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I come running back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

Beware of falling swingers  
Dropping all around you  
The pain that often mingles  
In your fingertips  
Beware of darkness  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of the thoughts that linger  
Winding up inside your head  
The hopelessness around you  
In the dead of night  
  
Beware of sadness  
It can hit you  
It can hurt you  
Make you sore and what is more  
That is not what you are here for  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of soft shoe shufflers  
Dancing down the sidewalks  
As each unconscious sufferer  
Wanders aimlessly  
Beware of Maya  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of greedy leaders  
They take you where you should not go  
While Weeping Atlas Cedars  
They just want to grow, grow and grow  
Beware of darkness

May not go well as it's too laid back.  
You need some oomph-papa, nothing like  
Frank Zappa  
And not New Wave they don't play that crap  
  
Tyr beating your head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Don't have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
I hear a clock ticking  
I feel the nitpicking  
I almost quit kicking at the wall  
There seems a confusion, under the illusion  
That they know just what will suit you all  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Ain't got time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
There is no sense to it  
Pure pounds and pence to it  
They're so intense too makes me amazed  
Don't want no music but, they're making you  
sick with  
Some awful noises that may get played  
  
By beating their heads on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Ain't no messing 'round with music  
Give them the blood from a clone  
  
Where will it all lead us  
I thought we had freed us  
From the mundane seems I'm wrong again  
Could be they lack roots, they're still wearing  
jack boots they're  
Marching somewhere in the pouring rain  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Don't have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone

About to go down  
I had almost forgot.

All I got to be is, be happy  
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it  
Blow Away, Blow Away, Blow Away.  
  
Sky cleared up, day turned to bright  
Closing both eyes now the head filled with light  
Hard to remember what a state I was in  
Instant amnesia  
Yang to the Yin.

Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst  
Breezes a-singing, now feeling good  
The moment had passed  
Like I knew that it should.

All I got to be is, be happy  
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it

Was painting whispers of a joy  
  
And I was in the candlelit bedroom  
Enchanting beauty shimmering magically  
Like an irridescent cloud  
Being blown by a westerly wind  
  
She can move your soul without you knowing  
She can take your breath away from heaven  
  
And I was captured by her loneliness  
A wounded tiger on a willowy path  
Like an opalescent moon all alone  
In the sky of a foreign land

She can move your soul without you knowing  
She can take your breath away from heaven

With a padlock on the night  
Leave the battlefield behind  
Stay out the fight  
Not lose my sight  
  
Now I only want to be  
With no pistol at my brain  
But at times it gets so lonely  
Could go insane  
Could lose my aim  
  
Now I only want to live  
With no teardrops in my eyes  
But at times it feels like no chance  
No clear blue skies  
Grey cloudy lies

Grey cloudy lies

And at times it was so blue and lonely  
Heading for the light  
  
Been close to the edge, hanging by my fingernails  
I've rolled and I've tumbled through the roses and the thorns  
And I couldn't see the sign that warned me, I'm  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh - I didn't see that big black cloud hanging over me  
And when the rain came down I was nearly drowned  
I didn't know the mess I was in  
  
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway  
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change  
And I get the strangest feeling, as I'm  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh - my hands were tired  
Jokers and fools on either side  
But still I kept on till the worst had gone  
Now I see the hole I was in

I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change

Living in the material world  
  
can't say what I'm doing here  
But I hope to see much clearer,  
After living in the material world  
  
I got born into the material world  
Getting worn out in the material world  
Use my body like a car,  
Taking me both near and far  
Met my friends all in the material world  
  
Met them all there in the material world  
John and Paul here in the material world  
Though we started out quite poor  
We got 'Richie' on a tour  
Got caught up in the material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky,  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I won't get lost  
Or go astray  
  
As I'm fated for the material world  
Get frustrated in the material world  
Senses never gratified  
Only swelling like a tide  
That could drown me in the  
Material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky,  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I won't get lost  
Or go astray  
  
While I'm living in the material world  
Not much 'giving' in the material world  
Got a lot of work to do  
Try to get a message through  
And get back out of this material world  
  
I'm living in the material world  
Living in the material world  
I hope to get out of this place

My salvation from the material world

The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,  
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.  
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,  
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,  
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,  
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Well meet on edges, soon, said I  
Proud neath heated brow.

I'm younger than that now.  
  
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth  
Rip down all hate, I screamed  
Lies that life is black and white  
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed  
Romantic facts of musketeers  
Foundationed deep, somehow.

Girls faces formed the forward path  
From phony jealousy  
To memorizing politics  
Of ancient history  
Flung down by corpse evangelists  
Unthought of, though, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,

A self-ordained professors tongue  
Too serious to fool  
Spouted out that liberty  
Is just equality in school  
Equality, I spoke the word  
As if a wedding vow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,

In a soldiers stance, I aimed my hand  
At the mongrel dogs who teach  
Fearing not that Id become my enemy  
In the instant that I preach  
My existence led by confusion boats  
Mutiny from stern to bow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats  
Too noble to neglect  
Deceived me into thinking

Good and bad, I define these terms  
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

Roll over beethoven, I hear it again today  
You know my temperature's rising and the juke-box blows a fuse  
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul is a-singing the blues  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
I got a rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues  
I think I got it off the writer sittin' down at the rhythm review  
Roll over beethoven, we're rockin' by two by two  
Well, if you feel you like it  
Well get your lover and reel and rock it  
Roll it over and move on up just  
A little bit further and reel and rock it, roll it over  
Roll over beethoven, and dig these rhythm and blues  
Early in the morning I'm a-givin' you the warnin'  
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Hey little little gonna play my fiddle, ain't got nothin' to lose  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
You know she winks like a glow worm and dance like a spinnin' top  
She's got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock  
Long as she's got a dime, the music will never stop

At your own made end  
With no one but yourself to be offended

I'm always here for you to love,  
Surrender to me, let me stay- ay- ay.

Resting in some golden flow,  
Becoming part of you it seems.  
  
Nothing separates my life  
From that which we have called our goal,  
It's all in this external world  
As results from deep within my soul-oul-oul.

My sense of time had disappeared,  
I see the sun has sunken low.

You're ev'rything my eyes could see.

Stay ever in your company-ny-ny.

From the heart of someone feeling so tired

With much speed and great haste  
Through the problems of being there  
In his heart at arm's length  
  
Held within its great strength  
To ward off such a great despair  
But he feels so alone  
With no love of his own

And give it away  
To someone who can fill the part  
Of the dream we once held

Lone-ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules  
Better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row

But this guitar can't keep from crying  
  
Learned to get up when I fall  
Can even climb rolling stone walls  
But this guitar can't keep from crying  
  
This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung, sometimes get mad  
Can't understand or deal with hate  
Responds much better to love  
  
I though by now you knew the score  
But you missed the point just like before  
And this guitar can't keep from crying

This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung, sometimes get mad

In the world's mighty gall'ry of pictures  
Hang the scenes that are painted from life  
There's pictures of love and of passion  
And there hangs a pictures of peace and of strife.  
  
There hangs pictures of youth and of beauty'  
Of old age and the blushing young bride  
They all hang on the wall, aw, but the saddest of all  
Are the picture from life's other side.  
  
Chorus: (Sang)  
Yes, te picture from life's other side  
Someone has fell by the way  
A life has gone out with the tide  
Aw, That may have been happy some day.  
  
There a poor old mother at home  
She's watching and waiting alone  
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear  
It's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
(Spoken)  
Now the first scene is that of a gambler  
Who'd lost all of his money playin'  
And then his draws his dead mother's ring from his finger  
That she wore long ago on her wedding day.  
  
Aw, it was his last earthly treasure, but he staked it  
And then he bows his head that his shame he might hide  
Aw, but when they lifted his head, they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
Now the last scene is set down by the river  
Of a heart-broken mother and babe  
And as the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast that no one will save.  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darlin' and pride  
(Sang)  
God help her, she leaps, for there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side...

And think of a church with nobody praying  
Have you ever looked up at a sky with no blue  
Then you've seen a picture of me without you  
  
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing  
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing  
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew  
Then you've seen a picture of me without you  
  
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing  
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing  
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two  
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

George Jones,A Place In The Country,/g/george+jones/a+place+in+the+country_20291530.html,"For thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city,  
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,  
He bought his wife the finer things,and sent his kids to collage,  
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside,  
  
But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going,  
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind,  
I watched his hair turn thin and gray, but his dream never faded,  
He told me all about it at least a thousand times.  
  
[Chorus]  
He always wanted, a place out in the country,  
Where the birds sing, in the morning,and the grass is emerald green,  
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,  
And sit out in the evenin', where the air is, fresh and clean.  
  
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses,  
And more to get his son out of his run-ins with the law,  
The more it took the more he gave, never once complaining,  
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all.  
  
I never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city,  
And now he's got that special little place to call his own,  
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him,  
It wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone.

WRITERS CLARK VAN NESS, JIMMY DICKENS  
(It was only a rose from the bride's bouquet.) I went to a wedding one bright
summer day The bride was a beauty and the people were gay Alone in a corner I
stood till the end For the girl was my sweetheart and the boy my best friend.
When the service was over there beside the church door I picked up a rose that
fell on the floor Alone and neglected as I was that day Was my sweet little
rose from the bride's bouquet. It was only a rose from the bride's bouquet
Once filled with loves perfume now faded and grey Like the love that she gave
me it faded away This sweet little rose from the bride's bouquet. Each petal
reminds me of a moment of bliss A sweet little love word and a lingering kiss
I waited in teardrops then hide it away My sweet little rose from the bride's
bouquet...

You know I still remember just as though it was only yesterday  
All the hell that my mom and dad went through to live on from day to day  
But the love they both gave us oh it was surely heaven sent  
And all the heartaches that I know I've caused 'em God knows I'll always
regret  
  
And there's wild flowers blooming

Going life's way, going life way.  
  
How we long for peace and love  
Home in the Father's house above  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
Sweet the thought that cares will cease  
Over the times our joys increase  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
On the way we'll rather sing  
Praises to Christ our Lord and King  
Going life's way, going life way.  
  
Though the dark way rugged might be  
It's his own hands guiding we seek  
Leading us too that mansion above  
Where there is joy, joy, joy, rapture and love.  
  
Jesus leads all shepherds, friends  
All of his own He will defend  
Going life's way, going life's way.  
  
Never will our Lord forsake  
Us till in life we shall awake  
Ending life's way, going life's way.

I know I've got to make it  
But I just can't take New York  
  
I came here  
All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city  
No family, no money  
And I don't even know what's hit me  
  
He hasn't seen a doctor  
Since he got here in the spring  
Went to the Medicentre  
But they wouldn't let him  
Without a green card  
Life can be so hard  
Take pity on a man without a home of his own  
How could he ever have known?  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
Man and women to the slaughter  
We just stand and watch them  
Do the Crazyman dance  
  
It's been one whole year  
And it's just not fair  
For all the pushing and shoving  
I've still got nothing  
I'm never gonna make it  
And I'm stuck here in New York  
  
So people don't come near  
Unless you've a dollar to spare  
'cause you know what they say  
About madmen on the subways of New York  
Believe it  
  
Yesterday's newspapers  
I wrap them around my body  
Outside these skyscrapers  
I wait for the night to hit me  
And boy, does it hit me  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
For a nickel or a quarter  
For your pleasure  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
  
I'm coming yo London  
I'm coming to Paris  
I'm coming yo make you good clean people embarressed  
Why don't you look at my face  
Why don't you look in my eyes  
You'd rather look at your feet  
You'd rather look at the skies  
  
Oh, you'd look anywhere  
But a man whose pure existence  
Says 'I ain't got time'  
And I don't care  
You just don't care  
Care

Cause they turn around inside it  
Then they spill off to our bed  
Do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice?  
  
When I've been a good boy  
When I've been a bad boy  
I have too much fun  
But baby so did everyone  
I've never been an angel  
But things are gonna change, change, change  
So do you really want to know?  
Do you really want to know my life?  
Would you have to let me go?  
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice?  
  
If you knew every woman  
And I knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I guess the saying is no longer true  
That what you don't know can hurt you  
I guess there is just no question, baby  
You know what you're doing in bed  
If I want your touch  
Should I know too much  
Some things are better left unsaid  
So do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice?

And don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?)

I used to say it but it's no longer true  
Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby)

Night after night, week after week  
Trusting to luck and a pocket full of rubbers

I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith

A huggin', kissin' friend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow - wooo

I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while - ooh

Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure

I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free

Hand in hand with ignorance  
And legitimate excuses  
  
The rich declare themselves poor

If we have too much

Because god's stopped keeping score  
I guess somewhere along the way

Turned his back and all god's children

Hanging on to hope  
When there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late

And charity is a coat you wear twice a year  
  
This is the year of the guilty man  
Your television takes a stand  
And you find that what was over there is over here  
  
So you scream from behind your door  
Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours""  
I may have too much but i'll take my chances  
Because god's stopped keeping score  
And you cling to the things they sold you  
Did you cover your eyes when they told you  
  
That he can't come back  
Beacuse he has no children to come back for  
  
It's hard to love there's so much to hate  
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late  
So maybe we should all be praying for time

George Michael,Precious Box,/g/george+michael/precious+box_10130026.html,"In my house there's a circle, where the life comes in  
From the stars to my home, down through the stone,  
I could have been so alone,  
Without my precious box  
Have I a family? I guess not  
I've never seen a lot of beauty  
In my life.  
  
Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim  
Such a beautiful home, your agent's on the phone, they never  
Leave you alone  
The party never stops!  
You say that's fantasy, I say ""So what, I need a little  
Beauty""  
  
So let me in,  
You know you've kind of got under my skin  
You know we never see a lot of the action round here  
My dear  
You may want to strip again  
  
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit  
And you're making more money than your daddy  
Could have imagined  
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time  
  
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb  
Don't you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra, I'm sorry baby  
I don't know why  
I don't know why that is  
  
The systematic breakdown of my community  
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God  
There's just never enough  
Switch on, the pressure, stops  
You know the one for me, she's on Fox  
And she's a little beauty  
  
Give me your life, give me your life, I want it  
Because lately, it's so freezing out here  
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass)  
In so many ways, but you make it good  
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could  
(This side of the glass)  
  
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb  
Don't you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby  
I don't know why  
I don't know why that is  
  
Precious keeps me company  
Keeps me from being alone  
  
Because no-one comes in the morning  
No-one comes in the evening time  
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring  
I could be waiting my whole damn life  
  
So sick of the same old faces  
In this street, where nobody talks to me  
And the funny side of the situation is  
I don't care, I'll always be there  
  
When you come down from the sky  
And make yourself at home  
In my house  
  
Because these days it's the money the money  
The money, honey, or your life  
I said don't you know you can't have both  
  
Stop acting so dumb  
The moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby  
I don't know why (something)  
Said I don't know why that is  
  
You may want to strip again  
You may want to let me in  
You may want to sacrifice  
More than you think is fair or right  
  
You may want to think again  
You may want to watch your friends  
You may want to change your mind  
You may wish you could turn back time.

I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game  
They went walking and she took his name  
Round here  
  
There was dancing in the afternoons those days  
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made  
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same  
  
Frightened little girl, she makes a break  
Into the arms of, something better  
Round here  
  
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park  
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark  
Waiting patiently to make my mark  
Round here  
  
And I remember my first day at school  
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool  
I remember it all, like yesterday  
  
Don't you  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says, ""You can do better""  
Round here  
  
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat  
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
When all that I wanted, was to be someone.  
  
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall  
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls  
Andy says it's time to show them all  
Round here  
  
Please sir, we two have other plans  
Please sir you would not understand,  
What's going on  
Is magical, can't you see  
That some of us do more than dream  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says, ""Keep on keeping, on and on....""  
Around here  
  
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again

I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
My birth,  
In this town,  
Yes I guess I got to be someone  
  
To be somebody  
In the Beautiful city  
  
This place I call home  
These streets of London  
It's everything I know (everything and everybody)  
On the streets of London  
I want to thank you

George Michael,These Are The Days Of Our Lives,/g/george+michael/these+are+the+days+of+our+lives_20059246.html,"Sometimes I get the feelin'  
I was back in the old days-long ago  
When we were kids, when we were young  
Things seemed so perfect-you know?  
Thedays were endless, we were crazy-we were young  
The sun was always shinin'-we just lived for fun  
Sometimes ot seems like lately-I don't know  
The rest of my life's been-just a show  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
You can't turn back the clock,  
You can't turn back the tide  
Ain't that a shame? (ain't that a shame?)  
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride  
When life was just a game  
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did  
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids  
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know  
Better sit back and go-with the flow  
  
'cause these are the days of our lives  
They've flown in the swiftness of time  
These days are all gone now but some things remain  
When I look and I find-no change  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
I still love you

George Michael,They Won't Go When I Go,/g/george+michael/they+wont+go+when+i+go_20059326.html,"No more lying friends  
Wanting tragic ends  
Though they do pretend  
They won't go when I go  
  
All those bleeding hearts  
With sorrows to impart  
Were right here from the start  
And they won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go where I've longed  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Gone from painful cries  
Away from saddened eyes  
Along with them I'll bide  
Because they won't go when I go  
  
Big men feeling small  
Weak ones standing tall  
I will watch them fall  
They won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go where I've long  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Unclean minds mislead the pure  
The innocent will leave for sure  
For them there is a resting place  
People sinning just for fun  
They will never see the sun  
For they can never show their faces  
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who will take more then he will give  
He ain't hardly gonna give  
  
The greed of man will be  
Far away from me  
And my soul will be free  
They won't go when I go  
  
Since my soul conceived  
All that I believe  
The kingdom I will see  
'cause they won't go when I go  
  
When I go  
Where I'll go  
No one can keep me  
From my destiny

Killing plauges the citizens  
Unless they own police

Did you put it on a train  
Did you leave it in the rain  
Or down in Mexico  
  
You cry, but I don't know  
I've heard it all before  
There it goes again, the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says ""put your troubles down beside me""  
Things have always been the same...  
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight...

I've really found someone like you  
  
Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say,  
That you will be by my side  
To see me through,  
Until my life is through  
  
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world,  
In love you and I, you and I, you and I  
  
I am glad at least in my life I found someone  
That may not be here forever to see me through,  
But I found strength in you,  
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,  
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,  
Don't worry what happens to me  
  
Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I  
In my mind we can conquer the world  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I

Have a few surprises of your own.

In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime

She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind  
  
He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone  
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home  
I know I've been away too long  
I never got a chance to write or call  
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all  
But I'll be home soon  
And honey is there somethin' wrong  
  
She said, don't bother comin' home  
By time you get here I'll be long gone  
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man  
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this  
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss  
But it's alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
He left that phone danglin' off the hook  
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look  
Then he just walked away  
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line

'Til we finally found a stopping place

One Sunday morning, rain pouring down

Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are

Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow

It shines, it's new

Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today

I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red

She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl

In every song he sang, I played the part.  
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
He played the fair in Dallas one year,  
In the cold October rain.  
Most folks stayed home and warm,  
But he sang just the same.  
I caught a chill before I got home.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.

The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!

All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying

Caught a fish caught a breeze  
And a thousand red sunsets

The best one yet

Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called ""original sin""  
Heard he'd killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
'Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle

Thought I'd paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues,  
Told me ""son, you ain't through""  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,  
These ol' Lone Star Blues.  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes

Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said ""cow town's where I'll go,  
You never know, I might get lucky!""  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin' as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol' boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day, my ears still ring!

And bring home my share of the dough  
But now I'm losin' out to the younger boys

With the girls out on the town  
But in those magic neon lights  
I know exactly what you found  
What about your home?  
And the man who loves you so  
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
Girl I can't hold you back  
Not one day longer  
If my love ain't strong enough  
To keep you home  
Just start the fire  
To burn the bridges  
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light

Short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile  
And nobody could stand to see him do without  
So we all drove over to see if we could help out

Ate with augustine monks, babbled in tongues  
Climbed the highest hill in peru  
Took a walk on the ganges, peeled the wraps of rameses  
Slayed me a dragon or two  
Turned saviors and saints, and little green men  
Moonshine and miracle drugs  
But I never quite saw the light  
'till I fell in love  
Pondered zen and zoroaster, and the life ever after

Chatting where the air is quite rare

Sweat and shame till the sun comes through  
I think of things I ought not to  
I've hung your memory on the wall  
A life-size portrait ten feet tall  
I feel my skin begin to crawl  
Suddenly I see you take a breath  
And out of the cameras you come through  
Is it you  
Must be my imagination  
Must be my imagination  
Must be the shock waves of the moon  
The entertainment of a lonely room  
The devil playing that same old tune  
'cause something strange is happening to me  
Feel in the land of make believe  
Please look me up and swallow the key  
'cause I feel your fingers running through my hair  
I feel the human touch of you

Wishin' on the stars in concrete  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
She's runnin' every light on the road to recognition

Under one condition  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
Anything goes  
When you play that game  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
You gotta stick it out  
If you want to claim your fame  
  
So some hotshot in a rag top  
Gets her on the silver screen  
A hundred mirrors far a backdrop  
But her face was never seen  
Agents of love, devils in disguise  
They're blowin' smoke in the little girl's eyes  
Yeah, she'll sign the dotted line and fall into submission

Someday she'll be a leading lady  
In a baby blue Mercede'  
When she's rich and famous  
Her scandals will entertain us  
The badder the better

Where lonely men sleep  
With what money can buy  
I tell myself that life ain't over just yet  
I can learn to forget if only I try  
And I try and I try but it's a lie

The love of earth has passed away  
And war after war how we fail and ignore what we defend  
And soon it will end  
The pain is east the pain is west  
The greed of all men has ravaged the blessed  
And year after year every crime reappears without a care  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Who's drowned the fires of our souls  
What have we done  
If God is good then God be cruel  
Take back the world you've granted to fools  
Salvage the land that is best without man and all his grief  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Who's drowned the fires of our souls

Blow as you may  
Wish I had the power  
To take your breath away  
This life is golden  
But it's only deep as the skin  
Feelin' much colder  
Though I'm standin' in the warm desert wind  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
I'll miss you blue sky  
But not so much  
Too much of a good thing  
Keeps this old soul out of touch  
Sometimes you're empty  
Though your dreams they all seem fulfilled  
You're cool on the outside  
Though the real you is slowly being killed  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
Left a girl lyin' 'neath an old willow tree  
At times I think she'll still be waitin' there for me  
Gotta leave this town  
But it's always one day away  
Just saw one more sunset on l.a.  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Don't want to see  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Baby wait for me

Gino Vannelli,The Other Man,/g/gino+vannelli/the+other+man_20499765.html,"An urgent call in the dead of night  
A voice that whispers ""Now""  
A voice that trembles like a winter leaf  
Before it hits the ground  
She leaves a crack in the bedroom door  
To slip the wire through  
Her husband sleeping in a empty bed  
No witness to the truth  
  
It's a oneway conversation  
I try to tell her no  
But it's a hopeless situation  
I just can't let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
As I am the other man  
  
She leaves my room like a criminal  
To beat the morning light  
Rehearsing ever little alibi  
To get it water tight  
  
There's a note on the dresser top  
It's the same old classic line  
She says she's leaving him  
It's just a question of time  
It's a no win situation  
  
'Cause I just can't let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
  
As I am the other man [Repeat: x4]

The lingering of your sigh  
Your sweet yet unconvincing smile  
Tell me no lie  
Is it a wish for second youth  
The age of lost romance  
Or does a half-forgotten dream need one more chance  
It's your life, what can I say  
Right or wrong, either way  
You owe it to yourslf to have your day  
Well I must admit I'm crushed  
Bewildered and betrayed  
Still I won't hold you to the promises we made  
Ah, love is such a mess  
It's a painful work of art  
Seems it's every man for himself to find his heart  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
No tears, no lies, no long goodbyes don't be cruel, baby  
Just let me wish you well  
Go seek and find, while I'm still inclined to play the fool, baby  
You owe it to yourself  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
Know for sure
