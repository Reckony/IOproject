Bee Gees,First Of May,/b/bee+gees/first+of+may_20015633.html,"When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
We used to love while others used to play.  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,  
And you don't ask the time of day.  
But you and I, our love will never die,  
But guess we'll cry come first of May.  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me,  
I watched the apples falling one by one.  
And I recall the moment of them all,  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
Do do do do do do do do do,  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.

Bee Gees,Flesh And Blood,/b/bee+gees/flesh+blood_20015855.html,"I'm not that someone who's got what you want.  
I can do nothing but watch what you do.  
You just want someone to kiss you good night,  
But lips are never enough to get you through.  
You stole my nights and you got your way,  
Now you got me dying inside, oh baby.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say.  
Pick up the pieces of my life  
Into the night of day.  
  
How do you break this heart of steel.  
Nobody ever could.  
Open the pages of my life.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
I'll be your saviour but baby I swear  
I'm not living my life over you.  
Some satisfaction you get if you dare  
But is it ever enough to get you through?  
You stole my mind and you watch me fall.  
Now you leave the scene of the crime, oh no.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
When you're gone,  
You'll be leaving behind  
A broken man with something to hide.  
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity,  
You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say (ooh),  
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day (ooh).  
How do you break this heart of steel?  
Nobody ever could (ooh).  
Open the pages of my life,  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Gone are the days that came and went.  
Houses are made of wood (ooh).  
Live in a world of sand and stone.  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.

Bee Gees,For Whom The Bell Tolls,/b/bee+gees/for+whom+the+bell+tolls_20015668.html,"I stumble in the night  
Never really knew what it would've been like  
You're no longer there to break my fall  
The heartache over you  
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through  
I never saw the signs  
You're the last to know when love is blind  
  
All the tears and the turbulent years  
When I would not wait for no-one  
Didn't stop and take a look at myself  
And see me losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the lonely heart breaks  
It's the one that forsakes  
It's the dream that we stole  
And I'm missing you more  
Than the fire that will roar  
There's a hole in my soul  
For you it's goodbye  
For me it's to cry  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Seen you in a magazine  
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine  
  
Now I know but a little too late  
That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I know there'll be times like this  
When I couldn't reach out to no-one  
Am I never gonna find someone  
Who knows me like you do  
Are you leaving me a helpless child  
When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea  
I'll follow you anywhere  
I promise I'll be there

Something only the lord arranges  
Oh my darling , now I found you  
Want to live all my life around you  
You're my light in a world of sorrow  
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow  
I just want to hold you forever , forever  
Loving one another that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
Oh my darling , if you leave me  
I lose the love that has always freed me  
Not knowing angel , what's coming after  
Never hearing you're golden laughter  
Oh my baby , hearts like thunder  
Can't escape from the spell I'm under  
I surrender to all your treasure  
Endless nights of pain and pleasure  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me

Bee Gees,Gilbert Green,/b/bee+gees/gilbert+green_20015859.html,"On a hill, inside a house in Covewell Reach  
Stands a man who's feeling very tired  
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago  
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show  
  
Every day I go away and find ideas  
Think I'll climb on top of somewhere high  
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead?  
Didn't really know if he was off his head  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day  
Mending fifty goblets that are worn  
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear  
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Now the house is burnt, along with Gilbert Green  
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry  
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen  
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
Now we can tell the world that he was right

May all go wrong.

There's no question in my mind where we should be.  
It's clear that you're alone and I'm alone.  
And all the fools have gone.  
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes.

We can make it one day, if we try.  
Be there, sunshine or rain.

Your tomorrows  
Let the universal word go out  
A million miles away

that when the seed is sown  
We are livig in a time when the tears fall  
Where they might  
But we hear each other much more than those who  
See

Were you once an outcast too  
  
I ask for nothing  
I can get by  
But I know so many  
Less lucky than I

The poor and down trod  
I thought we all were  
The children of God  
  
I don't know if there's a reason  
  
Why some are blessed, some not  
Why the few you seem to favour  
They fear us  
Flee us  
Try not to see us  
  
God help the outcasts  
The tattered the torn  
Seeking an answer  
To why they were born  
Winds of misfortune  
Have blown them about  
You made the outcasts  
Don't cast them out  
  
The poor and unlucky  
The weak and the odd  
I thought we all were  
The children of  
God...

A sign on my back I will wear, ""This is my last love affair""  
  
I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted  
You brought it back to me all broken and busted  
So I sold my heart to the junkman

You took my heart because you thought you could use it  
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again  
Like a melodrama, in a simple manner  
Love played the leading part  
We had planned a happy ending  
But I'm left with a broken heart  
I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear  
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear

My face is my fortune, that's why I'm totally broke.

Hang on like somechronic cough  
And every day some brand new issue  
Rears it's head to piss you off  
Bad guys win  
Optimism's wearing thin  
Things are spinning out of control  
Cynicism's all the fad

As hatters  
Almost every day  
Some underpinning slips away  
These aren't laughing matters

People keep on getting sick  
And a nickel's not worth a cent  
Wickedness and greed abound  
Just as peace is gaining ground  
It shatters  
Hate is here to stay  
And justice goes to those who pay  
Friend, these aren't laughing matters  
The truth is scarier by far  
Than anything that Stephen King could write  
The stories in the paper are  
The daily small decline and fall  
Spelled out in black and white  
Oh, what to do, what to do?  
How to take a brighter view  
When your noodle's totally fried  
Human spirits need to be  
Leavened by a little levity  
So take those blues  
And bounce them off the wall  
Keep your humor please  
'Cause don't you know it's times like these that  
Laughing matters most of all

That's all my life was  
Suddenly you danced up against me  
It felt warm and smooth  
I knew in an instant  
That you were my moment of darkest truth  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part  
  
Only you can shine the light  
On the dark side of my mind  
And your evil sweetness  
Leaves a trail of lovers behind  
When you crush me to your heart  
I feel just like a queen  
I'm a willing victim  
Tell me, all my life where have you been?  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part, haaa  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Take me down and love me forever  
Walk on through the halls of my soul  
Knight in black leather  
And you've got control  
Oh, don't ya know, baby?  
  
You're my knight!  
See'mon and love me forever!  
Rings on your fingers, love on demand  
Knight in black leather  
Oh, you've got command  
And how I love ya, baby  
  
Whoa, my knight!  
Sweet, sweet knight!  
You know that I love you, I love you, love you!  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aart!

And we will chain you down  
And love you forever  
Walk on through the halls of your soul  
Yeah, the knights in black leather  
We're in controoool!)

'Cause everything he owns is leather!  
A leather shirt, leather hat  
Leather gloves, leather spats  
Leather chaps, leather pants  
Leather socks, leather cap  
Leather coat! leather wrap!  
Leather neck! leather ring!  
Leather thing!!!!

It's gettin' cold out here  
  
Well, I keep walkin' with my head held high  
With my head to the sky  
With my mother's eyes  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the darkness that's been paid for  
I'm just a nameless stranger, don't know why  
  
Have I seen all that I could?  
Have I seen more than I should  
With my mother's eyes?  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the chilly winds of autumn  
If I ain't here by winter, she'll know why  
  
I've seen all that I dare  
I've seen more than my share  
Forgive me if I stare with my mother's eyes

Is when the sun comes shining through  
To make those rainbows in my mind  
When I think of you sometime  
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us  
We can make it if we try  
Just the two of us  
Just the two of us  
Building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us  
You and I  
  
We look for love no time for tears  
Wasted water's all that is  
And it don't make no flowers grow  
  
Good things might come to those who wait  
Not for those who wait too late  
We gotta go for all we know

I hear the crystal raindrops fall  
On the window down the hall  
And it becomes the morning dew  
  
And darling when the morning comes  
And I see the morning sun  
I want to be the one with you.

Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man

Billie Holiday,Autumn In New York,/b/billie+holiday/autumn+in+new+york_20018035.html,"It's time to end my holiday and bid the country a hasty farewell.  
So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel.  
I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of
adventures and battles,  
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!  
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?  
  
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.  
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me
feel I'm home.  
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.  
  
Autumn in New  
York is often mingled with pain.  
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands,  
It's autumn in New York,  
It's good to live again.

Said you call me at two

I had cocktails with Lee  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Stood me up in the rain  
Tried to hurt me again  
Bet you thought I'd be blue  
I went out to a show  
With a swell guy named Joe  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
These foolish games you keep playing  
Might work with somebody else  
But I could have told you  
Right from the start  
No man is man enough  
To break my heart  
  
If you don't come tonight  
Think you'll give me a fright  
Tell you what I will do  
I'll put on my best gown  
And go painting this town  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Listen Jack you're sweet Jill  
Will be out with some Bill  
Maybe I don't cry over you

How can I measure each and every part?  
How can I tell you how much I love you?  
How can I measure just how much I do?  
How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
And if I ever lost you  
How much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?

To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I wanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
  
Once I was old  
Twenty years or so  
Rather well preserved,  
The wrinkles didn't show.

Up my imaginary gun.

That would bore me terrific'ly too,

You're standing there before me.  
I get a kick though it's clear to me

It helps to keep our friends from knowing  
When they ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
It's funny how the blinding snow flakes  
Are right in time to hide my heartache  
Let them ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
When I think of the sun  
It scares me  
I wonder if I will pass  
And springtime, I hear  
Is early this year  
They'll see through me like glass  
  
I see no reason for this weather  
So let me be the first to make up  
If a reason must be had  
It's easy to blame the weather

I hear you whisper, ""I'll always love you""  
I know it's over and yet  
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have the lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me

Reaching for you  
  
You're so far above me

Who is as divine as you are

In my secret heart I pray you'll surrender soon  
No, it's like reaching for the moon

It was just one of those nights,  
Just one of those fabulous flights,  
A trip to moon on gossamer wings, just one of those things.  
  
If we'd thought a bit of the end of it when we started painting the town,  
We'd have been aware that our love affair was too hot not to cool down.  
So, goodbye, dear, and amen! Here's hoping we meet now and then.  
It was great fun, but it was just one of those things!

Let me get a word in there honey, you running your mouth  
You said I've worried you for years  
I'm just a barfly moochin' beers  
While you sweat over a hot stove slinging hash  
Work my fingers right down to the elbows  
Yes I may be good-for-nothin'  
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash  
First to admit it baby  
You said I spread my love all around  
And with the chicks all over town  
But, how can I when you keep me broke  
So I can't spend no cash  
Yes I may be good-for-nothin'  
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash  
Listen hear Pops,  
You know you lie about your youth  
I don't lie baby  
I'm just careless with the truth, that's all  
How careless can you be  
Oh, no  
With all your chicks  
You try to make a flash  
Now baby  
It ain't like that, no  
But you're still my good-for-nothin'  
My sweet hunk o' trash  
Now when you stay out very late  
It sure makes me mad to wait how come, baby?  
'Cause, you come home too tired  
To raise just one eyelash  
Watch it baby  
Watch it  
You're just good-for-nothin'  
But you're my sweet hunk o' trash  
Yes indeed!

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name  
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant  
Fall in love you won't regret it  
That''s the best work of all if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
'Neath the starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
Scrolling with the one girl  
Sighing after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for more  
Loving one who loves you  
And taking that vow  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if  
Won't you tell me how?

Only you beneath the moon and sun

It's no matter, darling, where you are

That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
In the silence of my lonely room

Night and day  
  
Night and day under the hide of me  
There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
And its torment won't be trough  
'Till you spent my life making love to you

Billy Joel,Allentown,/b/billy+joel/allentown_20072904.html,"Well we're living here in Allentown  
And they're closing all the factories down  
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time  
Filling out forms  
Standing in line  
Well our fathers fought the Second World War  
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore  
Met our mothers in the USO  
Asked them to dance  
Danced with them slow  
And we're living here in Allentown  
But the restlessness was handed down  
And it's getting very hard to stay  
Well we're waiting here in Allentown  
For the Pennsylvania we never found  
For the promises our teachers gave  
If we worked hard  
If we behaved  
So the graduations hang on the wall  
But they never really helped us at all  
No they never taught us what was real  
Iron and coal  
Chromium steel  
And we're waiting here in Allentown  
But they've taken all the coal from the ground  
And the union people crawled away  
Every child has a pretty good shot  
To get at least as far as their old man got  
But something happened on the way to that place  
They threw an American flag in our face  
Well I'm living here in Allentown  
And it's hard to keep a good man down  
But I won't be getting up today  
And we're living here in Allentown

Billy Joel,Always A Woman,/b/billy+joel/always+a+woman_20594319.html,"She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe you  
And she'll take what you give her, as long it's free  
Yeah, She steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Ohhh... she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time  
Ohhh... and she never gives out  
And she never gives in, she just changes her mind  
  
And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding  
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool  
And she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree  
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you  
But she's always a woman to me

Billy Joel,An Innocent Man,/b/billy+joel/an+innocent+man_20072863.html,"Some people stay far away from the door  
If there's a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know you're only protecting yourself  
I know you're thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But I'm not above  
Making up for the love  
You've been denying you could ever feel  
I'm not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
I'm only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that it's easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you don't want to hear what I say  
I know you're gonna keep turning away  
But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
I'm not above going through it again  
I've not above being cool for a while  
If you're cruel to me I'll understand  
  
Some people run from a possible fight  
Some people figure they can never win  
And although this is a fight I can lose  
The accused is an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man  
  
You know you only hurt yourself out of spite  
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight  
That's your decision  
But I'm not below  
Anybody I know  
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love  
I'm not above going back to the start  
To find out where the heartache began  
  
Some people hope for a miracle cure  
Some people just accept the world as it is  
But I'm not willing to lay down and die  
Because I am an innocent man  
  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man

Billy Joel,And So It Goes,/b/billy+joel/and+so+it+goes_20072921.html,"In every heart there is a room  
A sanctuary safe and strong  
To heal the wounds from lovers past  
Until a new one comes along  
  
I spoke to you in cautious tones  
You answered me with no pretense  
And still I feel I said too much  
My silence is my self defense  
  
And every time I've held a rose  
It seems I only felt the thorns  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And so will you soon I suppose  
  
But if my silence made you leave  
Then that would be my worst mistake  
So I will share this room with you  
And you can have this heart to break  
  
And this is why my eyes are closed  
It's just as well for all I've seen  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And you're the only one who knows  
  
So I would choose to be with you  
That's if the choice were mine to make  
But you can make decisions too  
And you can have this heart to break  
  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And you're the only one who knows.

Played in minor keys

From the life I've strayed in  
I've got scars  
From those dives I've played in

Why do I throw myself into the night

A misfit and a rebel  
I see the winos talking to themselves

Maybe a blind spot  
I haven't seen from the sensitive side

And if a word from you can bring a better day  
Then all I have are these games that I've been playing  
To keep my hope from crumbling away  
  
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping  
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand  
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping  
Will make the empty hours easier to stand  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Everybody has a dream... (Repeat)

Billy Joel,Famous Last Words,/b/billy+joel/famous+last+words_20073018.html,"Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain  
Summertime has come and gone and everybody's home again  
  
Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs  
I can still taste the wedding cake and it's sweet after all these years  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
That's why this took so long to write  
There will be other words some other day  
But that's the story of my life  
  
There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall  
They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall  
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade  
Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play  
But that's the story of my life  
  
And it's so clear standing here where I am  
Ain't that what justice is for?  
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore  
  
Stack the chairs on the table tops  
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers  
It slows down but it never stops  
Ain't it sweet after all these years  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
It's always hard to say goodbye  
But now it's time to put this book away  
And that's the story of my life  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
That's why this took so long to write  
There will be other words some other day  
Ain't that the story of my life

Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play

Billy Joel,Getting Closer,/b/billy+joel/getting+closer_20073001.html,"I went searching for the truth  
But in my innocence I found  
All the con men and their acrobats  
Who stomped me in the ground  
If I count up their percentages  
I know they're getting rich  
But they haven't taken everything  
Those paybacks are a bitch  
Though I've lost quite a lot  
I am still in control  
They can keep what they've got  
But they can't have my soul  
And if I don't have this all worked out  
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But I'm getting closer, getting closer  
What was ripped off by professionals  
Is not all that it seems  
While I must live up to contracts  
I did not give up my dreams  
If I see it as experience  
It hasn't gone to waste  
Lately all the missing pieces  
Have been falling into place  
And if I could go back and start over somehow  
I would not change that much  
Knowing what I know now  
Thought there have been sins  
I will regret  
Still I'm getting close, getting closer  
I don't have all the answers yet  
But I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I'm a mark for every shyster  
From Topanga to Berlin  
And I should have learned to kick them out  
As soon as they crawled in  
So to every bank in Switzerland  
That stores my stolen youth  
I'm alright because despite the laws  
You cannot hide the truth  
And although you will say  
I am still too naive  
But I have not lost faith  
In the things I believe  
And if I don't have this all worked out  
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But I'm still getting closer, getting closer

Billy Joel,Goodnight Saigon,/b/billy+joel/goodnight+saigon_20073008.html,"We met as soulmates  
On Parris Inland  
We left as inmates  
From an asylum  
And we were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives.  
  
We came in spastic  
Like tameless horses  
We left in plastic  
As numbered corpses  
And we learned fast  
To travel light  
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight  
  
We had no homefront  
We had no soft soap  
They sent us Playboy  
They gave us Bob Hope  
We dug in deep  
And shot on sight  
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might.  
  
We had no cameras  
To shoot the landscape  
We passed the hash pipe  
And played our Doors tapes  
And it was dark...  
So dark at night  
And we held onto each other  
Like brother to brother  
We promised our mothers we'd write  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said we'd all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together.  
  
Remember Charlie?  
Remember Baker?  
They left their childhood  
On every acre  
And who was wrong,  
And who was right?  
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight  
  
We, held the day  
In the palm of our hands  
They, ruled the night  
And the night, seemed to last as long as six weeks  
On Parris Island  
We held the coastline  
They held the highland  
And they were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
They heard the hum of the motors  
They counted the rotors  
And waited for us to arrive  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said we'd all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together.

Painful information  
Then these careless fingers  
They get caught in her vice  
Til they're bleeding  
On my coffee table  
Living alone isn't all that  
It's cracked up to be  
I'm on her side  
Why does she push the poison on me?  
Laura  
Has a very hard time  
All her life has  
Been one long disaster  
Then she tells me  
She suddenly believes she's seen  
A very good sign  
She'll be taking  
Some aggressive action  
I fight her wars  
While she's slamming her doors  
In my face  
Failure to break  
Was the only mistake  
That she made  
Here I am  
Feeling like a fucking fool  
Do I react the way exactly  
She intends me to?  
Everytime I think I'm off the hook  
She makes me lose my cool  
I'm her machine  
And she can punch all the keys  
She can push any button I was programmed through  
Laura  
Calls me  
When she needs a good fix  
All her questions  
Will get sympathetic answers  
I should  
Be so  
Immunized  
To all of her tricks  
She's surviving  
On her second chances  
Sometimes I feel like this  
Godfather deal is all wrong  
How can she hold an umbilical chord  
For so long?  
I've done everything I can  
What else am I supposed to do  
I'm her machine  
And she can punch all the keys  
She can push any button I was programmed through  
Laura  
Loves me  
Even if I don't care  
That's my problem  
That's her sacred absolution  
If she had to  
She would put herself in my chair  
Even though I  
Faced electrocution  
She always says  
I'm the best friend that  
She's ever had  
How do you  
Hang up on someone  
Who needs you that bad?

Billy Joel,Leningrad,/b/billy+joel/leningrad_20072979.html,"Victor was born  
The spring of '44  
And never saw  
His father anymore  
A child of sacrifice  
A child of war  
Another son who never had  
A father after Leningrad  
Went off to school  
And learned to serve the state  
Follow the rules  
And drank his vodka straight  
The only way to live  
Was drown the hate  
The Russian life was very sad  
And such was life in Leningrad  
  
I was born in '49  
A Cold War kid in McCarthy time  
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel  
Blast those yellow reds to hell  
Cold war kids were hard to kill  
Under their desks in an air raid drill  
Haven't they heard we won the war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
Victor was sent  
To some Red Army town  
Served out his time  
Become a circus clown  
The greatest happiness  
He'd ever found  
Was making Russian children glad  
And children lived in Leningrad.  
  
The children lived in Levittown  
Hid in the shelters underground  
Til the Soviets turned their ships around  
And tore the Cuban missiles down  
And in that bright October sun  
We knew our childhood days were done  
I watched my friends go off to war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
So my child and I came to this place  
To meet him, eye to eye and face to face  
He made my daughter laugh  
Then we embraced  
We never knew what friends we had  
Until we came to Leningrad.

On my knees

And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love

For something to happen

You can see it, you can taste it  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please

But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise  
  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and omega  
I knelt there  
Like one who believes  
And like a blessing come from heaven

I saw the Empire State laid low  
And life went on beyond the Palisades  
They all bought Cadillacs  
And left there long ago  
  
They held a concert out in Brooklyn  
To watch the island bridges blow  
They turned our power down  
And drove us underground  
But we went right on with the show  
  
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the ruins at my feet  
You know we almost didn't notice it  
We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street  
  
They burned the churches down in Harlem  
Like in that Spanish civil war  
The flames were everywhere  
But no one really cared  
It always burned up there before  
  
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the mighty skyline fall  
The boats were waiting at the Battery  
The union went on strike  
They never sailed at all  
  
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk  
And picked the Yankees up for free  
They said that Queens could stay  
They blew the Bronx away  
And sank Manhattan out at sea  
  
You know those lights were bright on Broadway  
That was so many years ago  
Before we all lived here in Florida  
Before the Mafia took over Mexico  
There are not many who remember  
They say a handful still survive  
To tell the world about  
The way the lights went out  
And keep the memory alive

Billy Joel,Pressure,/b/billy+joel/pressure_20073010.html,"You have to learn to pace yourself  
Pressure  
You're just like everybody else  
Pressure  
You've only had to run so far  
So good  
But you will come to a place  
Where the only thing you feel  
Are loaded guns in your face  
And you'll have to deal with  
Pressure  
You used to call me paranoid  
Pressure  
But even you can not avoid  
Pressure  
You turned the tap dance into your crusade  
Now here you are with your faith  
And your Peter Pan advice  
You have no scars on your face  
And you cannot handle pressure  
All grown up and no place to go  
Psych 1, Psych 2  
What do you know?  
All your life is Channel 13  
Sesame Street  
What does it mean?  
Pressure  
Pressure  
Don't ask for help  
You're all alone  
Pressure  
You'll have to answer  
To your own  
Pressure  
I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale  
But here you are in the ninth  
Two men out and three men on  
Nowhere to look but inside  
Where we all respond to  
Pressure  
Pressure  
All your life is Time magazine  
I read it too  
What does it mean?  
Pressure  
I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale  
But here you are with your faith  
And your Peter Pan advice  
You have no scars on your face  
And you cannot handle pressure  
Pressure, pressure  
One, two, three, four

Billy Joel,River Of Dreams,/b/billy+joel/the+river+of+dreams_20072931.html,"In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
From the mountains of faith  
To a river so deep  
  
I must be looking for something  
Something sacred I lost  
But the river is wide  
And it's too hard to cross  
  
And even though I know the river is wide  
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore  
And try to cross to the opposite side  
So I can finally find what I've been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the valley of fear  
To a river so deep  
  
And I've been searching for something  
Taken out of my soul  
Something I'd never lose  
Something somebody stole  
  
I don't know why I go walking at night  
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore  
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life  
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the jungle of doubt  
To a river so deep  
  
I know I'm searching for something  
Something so undefined  
That it can only be seen  
By the eyes of the blind  
  
In the middle of the night  
  
I'm not sure about a life after this  
God knows I've never been a spiritual man  
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river  
That runs to the promised land  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the desert of truth  
To the river so deep  
  
We all end in the ocean  
We all start in the streams  
We're all carried along  
By the river of dreams  
  
In the middle of the night

There's lot of people sayin' we'd better off dead  
Don't feel like satan, but I am to them

With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit  
He hates her life and what she's done to it  
There's one more kid that will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

We got department stores and toilet paper  
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer  
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive  
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

When she's all alone she cries

I could never understand why the urban attitude  
Is so superior  
In a world of high rise ambition  
Most people's motives are ulterior  
Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice  
Paying the price too long  
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate  
Of culture and intelligence  
The culmination of technology  
And civilized experience  
But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk  
A modern man accumulates  
I'm a statistic in a system  
That a civil servant dominates  
And all that means is that I'm running on ice  
Caught in the vise so strong  
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
As fast as I can climb  
A new disaster every time I turn around  
As soon as I get one fire put out  
There's another building burning down  
They say this highway's going my way  
But I don't know where it's taking me  
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race  
It's breaking me  
I get no traction cause I'm running on ice  
It's taking me twice as long

Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone

Perhaps a bottle of rose instead  
We'll get a table near the street  
In our old familiar place  
You and I,face to face  
  
A bottle of red, a bottle of white  
It all depends upon your appetite  
I'll meet you any time you want  
In our Italian Restaurant.  
  
Things are okay with me these days  
Got a good job, got a good office  
Got a new wife, got a new life  
And the family's fine  
We lost touch long ago  
You lost weight I did not know  
You could ever look so good after  
So much time.  
  
I remember those days hanging out  
At the village green  
Engineer boots, leather jackets  
And tight blue jeans  
Drop a dime in the box play the  
Song about New Orleans  
Cold beer, hot lights  
My sweet romantic teenage nights  
  
Brenda and Eddie were the  
Popular steadys  
And the king and the queen  
Of the prom  
Riding around with the car top  
Down and the radio on.  
Nobody looked any finer  
Or was more of a hit at the  
Parkway Diner  
We never knew we could want more  
Than that out of life  
Surely Brenda and Eddie would  
Always know how to survive.  
  
Brenda and Eddy were still going  
Steady in the summer of '75  
When they decided the marriage would  
Be at the end of July  
Everyone said they were crazy  
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy  
Eddie could never afford to live that  
Kind of life.""  
But there we were wavin' Brenda and  
Eddie goodbye.  
  
They got an apartment with deep  
Pile carpet  
And a couple of paintings from Sears  
A big waterbed that they bought  
With the bread  
They had saved for a couple  
Of years  
They started to fight when the  
Money got tight  
And they just didn't count on  
The tears.  
  
They lived for a while in a  
Very nice style  
But it's always the same in the end  
They got a divorce as a matter  
Of course  
And they parted the closest  
Of friends  
Then the king and the queen went  
Back to the green  
But you can never go back  
There again.  
  
Brenda and Eddie had had it  
Already by the summer of '75  
From the high to the low to  
The end of the show  
For the rest of their lives  
They couldn't go back to  
The greasers  
The best they could do was  
Pick up the pieces  
We always knew they would both  
Find a way to get by  
That's all I heard about  
Brenda and Eddie  
Can't tell you more than I  
Told you already  
And here we are wavin' Brenda  
And Eddie goodbye.  
  
A bottle of red, a bottle of white  
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight  
I'll meet you anytime you want  
In our Italian Restaurant.

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Some things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth  
No doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth  
These days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for  
My faith is falling away  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey wherever I go  
The more I find out the less that I know  
Black and white is how it should be  
But shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Once there were trenches and walls and one point of every view  
Fight 'til the other man falls  
Kill him before he kills you  
These days the edges are blurred, I'm old and tired of war  
I hear the other man's words  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey are all that I find  
When I look to the enemy line  
Black and white was so easy for me  
But shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out  
And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts  
Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for  
I won't be righteous again  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey are all that I find  
When I look to the enemy line  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me  
Shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Shades of grey wherever I go  
The more I find out the less that I know  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me  
Shades of grey are the colors I see

was pure evil.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was just a crazy  
dream, sometimes things arent what they are meant  
to be, or what they seem.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was one big dream  
so many tragedies, life threatning disease in

we pray for the families and the souls of the  
people shot dead they cry, roaming through the

to God to help me keep living. Jealousy

thrown in garbage cans every day.

tribulations that we face of course, time to put  
our foot down lets get to know our young ones  
before the next tragedy becomes the realest one.  
1999 this year is half was over. Lessons not learned,  
how your learning i couldve told ya. Maybe this  
happened for a reason only the Lord knows why. And  
this is for us to open up our eyes cause death awaits  
us at any given time. My love goes out to those  
whos souls rest tonight, and all we can do is just  
ask ourselves why? Wish this wouldnt be all we can  
do is pray and cry.  
  
Chorus  
  
Things change for the wrong we cant go on this long.  
Hand in hand right by your side, i love it then  
and no more cry so if i was to go to tonight, ill  
pray that youll be alright. One Lord one might rejoice,  
one soul unite one voice.  
  
Pray for all of us, Father let us not take  
things for granted, and please let us count  
each and every one of our blessings Father.  
  
Now generation X is what they call it whys that?  
Is it because this is where it all ends at, to  
go to war we dont need to be over seas. Its been  
declared out in the streets, gangs, thugs,  
moving drugs, government officials, blackmarket,  
military guns.  
Is this why you gave us the right to bare arms? To  
hit armagedon head on? Read between the lines its  
Genesise, and now the youth just dont smoke weed,  
they got things like man made methaphetamines  
never letting the young souls dream. And whats  
to do? When our youth is being mentally,  
physically, sexually abused. How do we change  
when its all put in our brains, money, sex,  
power, the year 2K. And everyday i watch  
the news it shows me how  
close we are to Judgement day, and  
so for its all worth i Pray.

We're not the same, don't leave me now

Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Who's made mistakes  
  
Just a word or two that she gets from you

The bad dreams  
The soft trembling shoulders  
The old fears

Oh, what has it cost you  
I almost lost you  
A long, long time ago  
Oh, you should have told me  
But you had to bleed to know  
All your past sins  
Are since past  
You should be sleeping  
It's all right  
Sleep tight  
Through the long night with me  
With me  
No, I didn't start it  
You're broken hearted  
From a long, long time ago  
Oh, the way you hold me  
Is all that I need to know  
And it's so late  
But I'll wait  
Through the long night with you  
With you

And the whole world is on your case,  
I would offer you a warm embrace  
To make you feel my love.  
  
When the evening shadows and the stars appear  
And there is no one there to dry your tears,  
I could hold you for a million years  
To make you feel my love.  
  
I know you haven't made your mind up yet  
But I would never do you wrong.  
I've known it from the moment that we met,  
No doubt in my mind where you belong.  
  
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,  
I'd go crawling down the avenue,  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love.  
  
The storms are raging on a rolling sea,  
Down on the highway of regret.  
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,  
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.  
  
I did make you happy, make your dreams come true,  
There's nothing that I would not do,  
Go to the ends of the earth for you  
To make you feel my love.  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love.

People tell me life is sweeter  
But I don't hear what they say  
Nothing comes to change my life  
So tomorrow is today  
  
I don't care to know the hour  
Cause it's passing anyway  
I don't have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday  
  
So I listen for an answer

And what's the use of always dreaming  
If tomorrow is today  
  
Still I'm waiting for the morning  
But it feels so far away  
And you don't need the love I'm giving  
So tomorrow is today  
  
Oh, my. Goin' to the river  
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me  
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it  
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it  
Too late. Too much given  
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it  
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way  
  
And some day if your dreams are leavin' you  
I'll still believe in you  
  
I don't care to know the hour  
Cause it's passing anyway  
I don't have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday

Billy Joel,Two Thousand Years,/b/billy+joel/two+thousand+years_20073024.html,"In the beginning  
There was the cold and the night  
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light  
Man was triumphant  
Armed with the faith and the will  
Even the darkest ages couldn't kill  
  
Too many kingdoms  
Too many flags on the field  
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed  
Time is relentless  
Only true love perseveres  
It's been a long time and now I'm with you  
After two thousand years  
  
This is our moment  
Here at the crossroads of time  
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line  
They are the vintage  
What kind of life will they live?  
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
Why are we so blind to fate?  
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate  
No end to sorrow  
Caused by the same endless fears  
Why can't we learn from all we've been through  
After two thousand years?  
  
There will be miracles  
After the last war is won  
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come  
Prophets and angels  
Gave us the power to see  
What an amazing future there will be  
  
And in the evening  
After the fire and the light  
One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night  
Time is relentless  
And as the past disappears  
We're on the verge of all things new  
We are two thousand years

It's not that easy anymore  
Today I do what must be done  
I give my time to total strangers  
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever  
MOre than it ever did before  
CHORUS  
Until the night, until the night  
I just might make it  
Until the night, until the night  
When I see you again  
Now you're afraid that we have changed  
And I'm afraid we're getting older  
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces  
So many lovers come and gone  
I'll have my fears like every man  
You'll have your tears like every woman  
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in  
And wonder how can we go on  
CHORUS  
When the sun goes down  
And the day is over  
When the last of the light has gone  
As they pour into the street  
I will be getting closer  
As the cars turn their headlights on  
While they're closing it down  
We're gonna open it up  
And while they're going to sleep  
We'll just be starting to touch  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to give  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to live

Before the light of the dawn  
Before this evening can end

Before your time  
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight  
Tonight,  
Too bad but it's the life you lead  
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need  
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right  
  
You've got your passion, you've got your pride  
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?  
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true

Slow down, you crazy child  
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile  
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

We're supposed to make mistakes  
But I survived all those long lonely days  
When it seemed I did not have a friend  
Cause all I needed was a little faith  
So I could catch my breath and face the world again  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in

Life is not an empty plate.  
That's if you appreciate yourself.

And if the dawn is fresh with dew,  
Aren't you glad you're you?  
When a meadowlark appears,  
Aren't you glad you've got two ears?  
And if your heart is singing, too,  
Aren't you glad you're you?  
You can see a summer sky,  
Or touch a friendly hand,  
Or taste an apple pie.  
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?  
And when you wake up each morn,  
Aren't you glad that you were born?  
Think what you've got the whole day through,  
Aren't you glad you're you?

A country highway or a moonlit yacht  
It could be in the parlor  
When the lights are burning low  
  
It could be in the movie  
In the very last row  
  
Down the old ox road  
In the magic of the moonlight  
You are filled with delight  
While the leaves that flutter o'er you  
  
Whisper lover tonight  
Why keep waiting, and debating  
When you know it's time for mating

Bing Crosby,I Found A Million Dollar Baby,/b/bing+crosby/i+found+a+million+dollar+baby_20197095.html,"It was a lovely April shower,  
It was a most convenient door,  
I found a million dollar baby  
In a five and ten cent store.  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hung around for three or four  
Around the million dollar baby  
In the five and ten cent store.  
  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes,  
I kept buying china  
Until the crowd got wise.  
  
Incidentally,  
If you should run into a shower,  
Well step inside my cottage door,  
And meet the million dollar baby  
From the five and ten cent store  
  
Love comes along like a popular song  
Anytime or anywhere at all,  
Rain or sunshine,  
Spring or fall.  
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello  
In a very unexpected place,  
For example, take my case.  
  
[Repeat]

As once more she sees  
Daffodils.

And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melody.  
I love you,  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me.

Sing, I do hear them singing

In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And mom and dad can hardly wait  
For school to start again

Only stay away on her day of rest

Of paradise where roses bloom.

Straight down the middle  
It went straight down the middle  
Then it started to hook just a wee, wee bit  
That's when my caddie lost sight of it  
That little white pellet has never been found to this day  
But it went straight down the middle like they say  
  
Whack down the fairway  
It went smack down the fairway  
Then it started to slice just a smidge off line  
It headed for two then it bounced off nine  
My caddie says long as you're still in the state you're okay  
Yes it went straight down the middle quite a ways  
  
The sun was never brighter  
The greens were never greener  
And I was never keener to play  
I heard it came down the middle  
It went zing down the middle  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
There's always the lies in the locker room  
And I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle today  
  
Oh the life of a golfer is not all gloom  
Though they should charge just for listening in the locker room  
But I'm in my glory when wrapped in a towel I say  
That it went straight down the middle  
Where it wound up is a riddle  
But it went straight down the middle far away

Hang them up out in the sun,  
And they'll evaporate!  
When the trouble starts  
Pounding at your heart,

When I awoke in bed she lay beside me  
And she read me with her eyes, she said

Be careful of what you might find

Make your own truth, and get out of my way

An angel or the Antichrist  
A symbol of your own device  
Pathetic in your own sad way  
You're just one pill away  
From taking my advice  
  
Do you believe every word I say?  
Make your own mind, and get out of my way

That I descended from the sky?  
The graven image of a pseudo icon  
To worship me on high?  
  
I'm not your savior  
I got no wings to fly  
Just your pariah  
Don't look to me when your life is over

Falls down in tears

In orbit always

Bathed in cool breeze  
Silver starlight  
Breaks down the night  
And so we pass on by  
The crimson eye  
Of great god mars

Shaded past and I can  
Drag you down into the  
Depths of my soul.

The illusion of power.  
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,  
The illusion of power.

I'll save you from your dreams, yeah

We began to roll  
And as we get trashed we were laughing still

Although you won't change my anyway, no no way  
  
I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you  
I want to set my mind all free  
You understand me woman, you give me time  
But I don't need no sympathy  
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved  
Instead of hiding in myself  
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way  
  
Nobody's gonna change my world  
That's something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel  
  
So listen to me now, hear what I say

To lend a guiding hand.  
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!

All you did was wreck my bed,  
And, in the morning, kick me in the head

And make a living out of playing pool.  
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'

Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  
  
""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,  
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.  
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""  
  
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

Bob Dylan,Arthur Mcbride,/b/bob+dylan/arthur+mcbride_20021371.html,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.

I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

Now that train is a-graveyard bound.

Lakes and streams and mines so free,

Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+in+plain+d_20021147.html,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is

Give me some milk or else go home""

I didn't think one could be so wrong  
And then one night I was drinkin' and a-thinkin'  
In the bottom of the glass I could see Bessie's face so strong  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
When she sees me will she know what I've been through?  
Will old times start to feelin' like new?  
When I get there will our love still feel so true?  
Yet all I have, I'll be a-bringin' it to you  
Oh Bessie, sing them old-time blues

Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,/b/bob+dylan/black+diamond+bay_20021331.html,"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

Bob Dylan,Catch The Wind,/b/bob+dylan/catch+the+wind_20732994.html,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,  
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,/b/bob+dylan/changing+of+the+guards_20021554.html,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

But friends when you're lonely  
You'll find that it's only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January  
I'll just go and disappear

And hang them down from the vine  
Of all my loves you've been the closest

Heaven blazing in my head

Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God

Can't be learned in a day

And glory will rot

Of evening have rung

On the end of the tongue

To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full

Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses

They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama

Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

Bob Dylan,Diamond Joe,/b/bob+dylan/diamond+joe_20021374.html,"Now There's a man you'll hear about  
Most anywhere you go,  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe.  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Bob Dylan,Dirge,/b/bob+dylan/dirge_20021491.html,"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do

Driving me insane

I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do

Driving me insane

The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace  
Hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Bob Dylan,Every Grain Of Sand,/b/bob+dylan/every+grain+of+sand_20021535.html,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

Broken idols, broken heads,  
People sleeping in broken beds.  
Ain't no use jiving  
Ain't no use joking  
Everything is broken.  
  
Broken bottles, broken plates,  
Broken switches, broken gates,  
Broken dishes, broken parts,  
Streets are filled with broken hearts.  
Broken words never meant to be spoken,  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn around  
Something else just hit the ground  
  
Broken cutters, broken saws,  
Broken buckles, broken laws,  
Broken bodies, broken bones,  
Broken voices on broken phones.  
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplace  
Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs,  
Broken treaties, broken vows,  
Broken pipes, broken tools,  
People bending broken rules.  
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,  
Everything is broken.

And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.  
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,  
Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.

I will write you a letter from time to time,  
As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.  
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,  
I will send what I learn back home to you.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'

I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,  
Be them somebody else's or my own.  
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,  
I will travel unnoticed and unknown.

I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,  
It's down around the old Mexican plains.  
They say that the people are all friendly there  
And all they ask of you is your name.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,

Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina

And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea

And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.

They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be

Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden

They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,

It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,  
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
I'll take all the smog in California  
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.  
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.

You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.  
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,  
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.  
  
Hard times in the city,

I won't come here no more if it bothers you

I'm having a hard time believin' some people were ever alive

I can't tell my heart that you're no good

And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears

My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these new blue jeans  
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.

Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans

And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,

I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,

Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck

One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.

For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same

To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong

In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".

Alive with fiery breath

And bowed my head and cried.

So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.

Cause I don't think about it.  
  
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades  
And talk with my chambermaid.  
She knows that I'm not afraid  
To look at her.  
She is good to me  
And there's nothing she doesn't see.  
She knows where I'd like to be  
But it doesn't matter.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,  
He spoke to me, I took his flute.  
No, I wasn't very cute to him,  
Was I?  
But I did it, though, because he lied  
Because he took you for a ride  
And because time was on his side  
And because I  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.

Bob Dylan,I Was Young When I Left Home,/b/bob+dylan/i+was+young+when+i+left+home_20350194.html,"I was young when I left home,  
And I been out a'ramblin' 'round,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.  
To my home, Lord, to my home,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.  
  
It was just the other day  
I was drinkin' on my pay  
When I met an old friend I used to know.  
He said your mother's dead and gone,  
Your baby sister's all gone wrong,  
And your daddy needs you home right away.  
  
Not a shirt on my back,  
Not a penny on my name.  
Well I can't go home this a'way.  
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,  
I can't go home this a'way.  
  
If you miss the train I'm on,  
Count the days I'm gone,  
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.  
A hundred miles, a hundred, baby,  
Lord Lord Lord,  
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.  
  
When I's playin' on the track,  
Maw would come and whip me back,  
On them tressles down by ol' Jim McKay's.  
  
When I pay the debt I owe  
To the commissary store,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.  
Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.  
  
I used to tell my Maw sometimes,  
When I see them ridin' blinds,  
Gonna make me a home out in the wind.  
In the wind, Lord, in the wind,  
Make me a home out in the wind.  
  
I don't like it in the wind,  
I want to go back home again,  
But I can't go home this a'way.  
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,

Bob Dylan,Idiot Wind,/b/bob+dylan/idiot+wind_20021193.html,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that  
Sweet lady.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,  
Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

The best is always yet to come,  
That's what they explain to me.  
Just do your thing, you'll be king,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, why not me  
Across the swamp of time?  
My mind weaves a symphony  
And tapestry of rhyme.  
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee  
So it may flow and be,  
To each his own, it's all unknown,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, then what must be,  
Must be, and that is all.  
True love can make a blade of grass  
Stand up straight and tall.  
In harmony with the cosmic sea,  
True love needs no company,  
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

Who's never weak but always strong  
To protect you an' defend you  
Whether you are right or wrong  
Someone to open each and every door  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me babe

Go lightly on the ground

Who will promise never to part  
Someone to close his eyes for you  
Someone to close his heart  
Someone who will die for you an' more

No, no, no, it ain't me babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.  
  
Go melt back into the night  
Everything inside is made of stone  
There's nothing in here moving  
An' anyway I'm not alone  
You say you're looking for someone  
Who'll pick you up each time you fall  
To gather flowers constantly  
An' to come each time you call  
A lover for you life an' nothing more  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe

But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin' through  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies, are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Bob Marley,Soul Captive,/b/bob+marley/soul+captive_20732355.html,"Yesterday, a child came out to wander  
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar  
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder  
And tearful at the falling of a star  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Then, the child moved ten times 'round the seasons  
Skated over ten clear frozen streams  
Words like, ""When you're older"", must appease him  
And promises of someday make his dreams  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came,  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now  
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him, ""Take your time. It won't be long now.  
'Til your drag your feet to slow the circles down""  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true  
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty  
Before the last revolving year is through.  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return, we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and 'round and 'round  
In the circle game  
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.

Burgers on the grill  
Burgers on the grill  
I've really had my fill  
Of burgers on the grill  
When the relatives go home  
I'm stuck with chicken bones  
And burgers on the grill  
  
There's a steak tip on the coals  
It fell down through the holes  
And now it's caught on fire  
Smells like a funeral pyre  
I was tryin' to get it back  
But it's turnin' pretty black  
Steak tip on the coals  
  
Yeah!  
  
Wiener on the foil  
The skin begins to boil  
I dropped it in the soil  
I thought that it was spoiled  
So I washed it with a hose  
And fed it to Aunt Rose  
Wiener on the foil

They eat to grow, grow to die  
Die to be et at the hamburger fry

Nobody thunk it, nobody knew  
No one imagined the great cow guru  
Cows are one  
  
He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal  
He loved Che Guevara, a revolutionary veal  
Cow Tse Tung  
  
He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred  
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd  
Cow doldrums  
  
He mooed ""We must fight, escape or we'll die""  
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high  
Bad cow pun  
  
But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate  
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate  
Cows are bummed  
  
He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy  
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi  
Cows with guns  
  
They came with a needle to stick in his thigh  
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye  
Cow well hung  
  
Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door  
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor  
Run cows run!  
  
He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay  
We are free roving bovines, we run free today  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
They crashed the gate in the great stampede  
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed  
Cows have fun  
  
Sixty police cars were piled in a heap  
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep  
Much cow dung  
  
Black smoke rising, darkening the day  
Twelve burning Mcdonalds, have it your way  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
The President said ""enough is enough  
These uppity cattle, it's time to get tough""  
Cow dung flung  
  
The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief  
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef  
Cows on buns  
  
The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed  
They mooed their last moos, they chewed their last hay  
Cows out gunned  
  
The order was given to turn cows to whoppers  
Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers  
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers  
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns

I knew right then I'd never leave her  
She had taken me so soon  
When she went  
She went

Listened all night to the wind  
Sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried  
Sometimes we just went for a swim  
All that time my love kept growing, growing, growing  
Made me feel so warm inside  
All the time her smile glowing

There in the darkness with the radio playing low  
And the secrets that we shared  
The mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove  
And I remember what she said to me  
How she swore that it never would end  
I remember how she held me oh so tight  
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were young and strong, we were runnin'

And I found myself alone  
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home  
And I guess I lost my way  
There were oh so many roads  
I was living to run and running to live  
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed  
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searching  
Searching for shelter again and again  
  
Against the wind  
A little something against the wind  
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind  
  
Well those drifter's days are past me now  
I've got so much more to think about  
Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in, what to leave out

Watch the young man run

You never seem to reach the end  
Someone's out there on the street tonight  
When things go wrong  
He'll guarantee to make them right  
If the price is right  
  
Every time I look you're fallin' fallin'  
Beaten by the wind  
Every time I turn around he's there again  
  
It's like a full force gale  
An american storm  
You're buried far beneath a mountain of cold  
And you never get warm  
It's like a wall of mirrors  
You charge 'em at full speed  
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You never feel the need  
  
Everybody casts a certain light  
A special gift  
It's theirs to use for wrong or right  
When you face the night  
More and more we choose the easy way  
We take no risks  
We figure out which games to play  
And how to make 'em pay  
  
Suddenly the pressure's fallin' fallin'  
Skies have all turned grey  
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way  
  
It's like a full force gale  
Atop a mountain of cold  
You tell your story again and again  
And it never gets old  
It's like a wall of mirrors  
You charge 'em at full speed  
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed

Everybody's hoping they can score  
Everybody's looking for perfection

Sherriff gribbs with his grim ad libs  
  
Spoutin' 'bout the crime in the streets  
  
And women were screamin' and some were dreamin'

You know that music died, hurt my pride

We stayed inside for a week  
  
We weren't in town for no mardi gras  
  
So we decided to sleep  
  
Houston, yes, was a good old guest  
  
Tho knows how bad we wanted to play  
  
But we got homesick for lincoln park

Out went to alert the world  
  
Then some psuedo-intellectuals  
  
Even got it unfurled  
  
Takin' notes on that harvard course  
  
And got me on a bottle of seed

So square to try and leave

Ain't shinin bright  
And the moon the moon the moon  
Won't shine for you tonight  
If the stars in the sky gone away  
And you feel  
Feelin real low down today  
If life gets hard to understand  
And the whole thing is getting out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa  
  
If you need a pacifier  
Call me anytime  
I'll try to be your satisfier  
If you feel

Blazin' at the bit  
Call my number  
Anytime night or day  
I'll get ya fixed  
If life gets hard to understand  
If your life is way out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa

Bob Seger,Comin' Home,/b/bob+seger/comin+home_20021990.html,"Passed the old church on the edge of town  
Trailways bus was right on time  
Passed your uncle's store on main street  
His old truck was parked outside  
Everything seemed so much larger then  
This old town has hardly grown  
Has it really been ten long years  
Now you're finally comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You've been gone so very long  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
You left your hometown for the city lights  
You were young and you were strong  
Lots of traffic lots of sleepless nights  
Lots of dreams that all went wrong  
You'll just tell them what they want to hear  
How you took the place by storm  
You won't tell them how you lost it all  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You grew tired of being alone  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home

21 years old, waiting on my turn to die  
Every minute Lord, every minute seems like five  
And if it wasn't for the window,  
I'd wonder if the world outside was alive  
Yeah, smokin cigarettes, drinkin' coffee  
And waiting on my last meal, I try to pretend  
  
I try to pretend but this cell is much too real  
Oh, I should have left that chick alone  
I curse the day, I curse the day she was born, now  
Oh the old men they tell me  
They tell me love is akin to hate  
But before I die, I just gotta get it straight now  
  
Crush out my cigarette, throw away my coffee and scream  
Ahhhhhhh, I don't wanna die  
Oh, I don't wanna die  
  
Oh, it's too late they'll be comin' for me soon  
It's too late to pray, and anyway, God can't see this room  
I'm startin' to sweat now, It won't be long now  
I can see  
They're gonna put me in that chair  
They're gonna put me in that chair and that's how the end's gonna be  
Yeah, it's gettin cold, it's gettin colder  
And I'm startin' to scream, Ahh I don't wanna die  
Don't leave me here to die

He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his  
  
  
Hobnail shoes

Wound up in the local hole, without a radio,  
  
And he wrote Aunt Mary said ""Momma, it's getting hairy,Down Home.""  
  
  
  
Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed  
Eddie on out  
  
  
Which tripped out Willie, oh man you should've heard  
  
Him shout..  
  
  
Their way home.

Any road home

Looked just like a gypsy

Everyone mistook her for the loser of the year  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Tell us we should live just so  
  
Enda did not know  
Ah Edna didn't care  
  
Two weeks later, Edna laughed at her confession  
  
Gave the nuns a chill  
Laughed just like a gypsy  
  
  
Everybody said she'd never be forgiven  
Everybody cursed her, said that she was ill  
  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Ah Edna didn't care  
Tell us we should live just so  
Oh she did not know  
  
  
Just the other day I heard some people talkin'  
Edna went out walkin' and she passed away  
  
No one knew exactly just what happened  
No one came to mourn her, we all stayed away

Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'  
Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over  
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further  
All the fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'  
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'  
  
Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher  
She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her  
We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'  
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'  
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up  
The cops came bustin' in and then we lit out in our pickup truck go  
  
Get out of Denver baby go go  
Get out of Denver better go  
Get out of Denver better go go  
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better  
Get out of Denver  
  
Well red lights were flashin' and the sirens were a-screamin'  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we was dreamin'  
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower  
  
The rain kept drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber  
We kept on drivin' till we ran into some fog cover  
We couldn't see a thing somehow we just kept on goin'  
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'  
'Fore it finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at  
We're starin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat go  
  
Get out of Denver he said go go

Off a cape
