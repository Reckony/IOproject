Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined

And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke

And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix

Also appeared on the live Thin Lizzy album BBC Radio One Live In Concert 1983  
A Night In The Life Of A Blues Singer  
(Lynott)  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
I had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
And all the time  
I was paying my dues  
Like an old blues singer  
And I had no troubles then  
But I had lots of friends  
Friends they come and go  
And sometimes friendship ends  
All the time, I've had a friend on whom I depend  
So blues singer  
Oh...  
Oh mama, mama, mama, this is your boy  
Oh mama, mama, mama, mama, my soul's been destroyed  
Oh mama, mama, your pride and joy  
Is a blues singer  
An old blues singer  
And the party's over now  
Everybody's goin' home  
The band is packin' up  
And I'm on my own  
Oh, but I miss you now you're gone  
Mama, your boy's a blues singer  
Such an old blues singer  
Nothin, oh but nothin's changed  
Oh sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
I lost ya mama  
I lost ya mama  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
Had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
But all the time  
You must chose  
I'm an old blues singer

To get the thing he needs the most  
  
Lady Luck has me covered  
Keeping her watchful eyes over me

The charge is first degree  
  
Angel, she's a killer  
Just flown in from the coast  
Makes the hit, it's a winner  
Leaves you dead as the post

Was happening across the hall

The bullets flew astray  
The noise it was frightening

There's millions of them  
  
I've seen a fire start in Frisco  
The day that the earth quaked  
I've seen buildings a-blazing  
Throwing up in flames  
  
I heard men, women and children  
Crying out to their God for mercy  
But their God didn't listen  
So they were burned alive  
  
They went down, down, deep underground  
In the great disaster  
  
I was hanging out in Berlin  
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine  
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers  
March right across the Maginot line  
  
I've seen two world wars  
I've seen men send rockets out into space  
I foresee a holocaust  
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race  
  
Down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher  
By the name of Nostradamus  
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century  
An angel of death shall waste this land  
  
A holocaust the likes of which  
This planet had never seen  
Now, I ask you  
Do you believe this to be true  
  
I was standing by the bedside  
The night that my father died  
He was crying out in pain  
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy  
  
His body was riddled with a disease  
Unknown to man so he expected no cure  
But before he died that night  
He was lost, insane  
  
He went down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
You'll go down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster

So I ride out to the old sundown  
  
I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.  
Lord I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female.  
The nights we spent together, riding on the range.  
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around.  
Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.  
  
I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.  
Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.  
Down below the border, in a town in Mexico,  
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.  
  
Roll me over, and I'll turn around  
And I'll move my fingers up and down  
Up and down  
  
It's okay amigo, just let me go  
Riding in the rodeo  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo  
Roll me over and set me free, the cowboy's life is the life for me

You took me with a glance  
I should have took that last bus home  
But I asked you for a dance  
  
Now we go steady to the pictures  
I always get chocolate stains on my pants  
My father he's going crazy  
Say's I'm living in a trance  
  
But I'm dancing in the moonlight  
It's caught me in its spotlight  
It's alright, alright  
Dancing in the moonlight  
On the long hot summer night  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning  
And I'm on the streets again  
I disobeyed another warning  
I should have been in by ten  
  
Now I won't get out until Sunday  
I'll have to say I stayed with friends  
But it's a habit worth forming  
If it means to justify the end

Suffered and he fought for what he believed  
The fighting is over now, the man is dead  
A martyr for the cause  
  
Man with the golden arm, his face gone pale  
Taken too much junk, he's gone over the rail  
Breathes out a sigh and his body wails  
He's gonna land in trouble, land in jail  
  
He'd give his life, give his everything  
To reach that goal and take that last and final fling  
But I guess it's just another story  
In the greatest story ever told

When Diddy Levine lived with Eunice King  
He gave her the ring that she wore  
Janice the smiling daughter  
Who came from a marriage way before  
But Eunice was the father that she always saw  
Though they never, never, never, never, never, never told her  
She always knew the score  
You see kids were so much wiser after the wars  
But Diddy hadn't had enough, she had to get some more  
On a ration piece of paper  
She wrote 'Eunice, I'm not sure'  
And with her child in her arms  
She went looking for a fling  
Besides, she didn't like the name 'Mrs. King'  
The first time that she heard Damper Dan  
Was on the radio  
Crooning at a volume that was way, way down low  
Diddy was surprised to hear that Damper's name was Dan  
Soon after he was a calling  
And he asked, begged and pleaded for her hand  
Damper's heart was dampened  
When Diddy answered ""No, no, no, no, no""  
But if she changed her mind she said ""Dan, I'll let you know""  
With her child in her arms  
She went looking for a man  
Besides she didn't like the name Damper Dan  
Janice the smiling daughter grew up to be a teenage queen  
Through all of her mother's lovers  
She kept the name 'Levine'  
Behind the picture house she first made her scene  
Liked a boy called Allister  
Who was dating a friend called Celine  
And Celine wasn't mad when Janet came in between  
But Allister got scared when he heard  
And he joined the U.S.A. Marines  
Inheritance you see runs through every family  
Who is to say what is to be, is any better  
Over and over it goes goodness and badness wind blow  
Over and over, over and over  
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over  
The good wind and the bad wind blow

Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife  
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
""I need your, I need your romance""  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and I'd abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair, all was right  
And now I know, I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse

Thin Lizzy,It's Getting Dangerous,/t/thin+lizzy/its+getting+dangerous_20136647.html,"The man finds himself alone for the first time in his life  
He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right  
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night  
He's got to work it all alone  
  
Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve  
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go  
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?  
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain  
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain  
Now who in the world would have know  
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown  
  
Through the rain, the sleet and snow  
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul  
So the let the cold winds blow  
What he doesn't see he doesn't know  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
He said, watch out for the danger  
He said, watch out  
  
The man is a winner for the first time in his life  
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter  
But if you look closely  
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind  
  
And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done  
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul  
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips  
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
But now we're all grown up and we're strangers  
You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped  
Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers

Thin Lizzy,Shades Of A Blue Orphanage,/t/thin+lizzy/shades+of+a+blue+orphanage_20136660.html,"When we were kids he used to go over the back wall into old Dan's scrapyard  
Into the snooker hall where most us kids were barred  
An' into the roxy and the stella where film stars starred  
That's where me and Hopalong an' Roy Rogers got drunk and jarred  
And we might have been the saviour of the men,  
The captured captain in the devil's demon den  
And we might have been the magic politician in some kind of tricky position  
Like an old, old, old master musician we kept on wishin'  
We was headed for the number one hit country again

And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
There's an old photograph of Dan that I wish you could-a seen  
Of him and the boys posed, standing in St. Stephen's green  
Ya see, they were a part of the great freedom dream  
But they were caught and detained and are locked inside the frame  
Of the photograph  
An' he might have been the clever con, the good samaritan, the rassclaut man  
An' he might have been the loaded gun, the charlatan of the tap dancin' fan  
But like an old pioneer from outer Afghanistan,  
Headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
Old Dan in a raincoat hums the very, very, very special notes  
Of a long lost favorite melody  
It reminds him of a love affair when he was young and did not care  
And how he parted so soft, so sadden  
And he might have been the laughing cavaliero, the wise old commanchero  
Ow, the desperate desparado, the good looking Randolph Valentino,  
The gigolo from glasgow  
But like an old, old hunter of the female buffalo,  
He's headed for the number one hit country again

And it's true  
It's so true  
Ummm, it's true  
I swear I've said it

And all the people's faces turned strawberry blonde  
  
By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits  
For the sun making sure it's not late  
""just in time"" ""no need to fear"" ""well, just in case""  
And all the people are happy for another year  
  
And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun  
Getting it's glow  
He goes on  
Singing this song  
  
To feel the goodness glowing inside  
To walk down a street with my arms about your hips, side by side  
To play with a sad eyed child till he smiles  
To look at a starry sky at night, realize the miles  
  
To see the sun set behind the steeple  
Clontarf castle, no king, queen or knightly people  
A coal fire and it's pouring rain  
To wave goodbye to a very good friend, never meet again  
Little thoughts bring little memories of you to me

In the moonlight he left his old steed  
Near the drawbridge that he crossed  
And by way of a rope ladder  
He tip-toed to where his woman was

Who followed the stars  
Searching for  
The lost city of Mars  
  
Hoping time would heal the scars  
Knowing fate held no bars

That I think you are?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?

""You're a liar"" cried the crown

And let a crystal ball tear  
Fall on the crown  
From down below

Who took to the stage  
Set the world ablaze  
With your anger and your rage  
  
With every new leaf  
You turned and wrote a new page  
Cleverly concealing  
Your real age  
  
Those that knew you  
Were always quite amazed  
Are you the one  
Who can take this praise?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?

Just another moment  
When the sound of your voice  
Cuts me to the ground  
Locked in here just to make  
Myself feel better  
Look in the mirror  
And tell myself that I'm okay  
I know it doesn't matter  
Whatever I do  
It's always second best

I wanted to go  
But I just lost my way  
Watching you unravelling  
The last piece of thread  
That held me into place  
I don't care if you hear a word  
I'm saying  
I can only hear  
The voices screaming in my head  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
And I'm sick of dreaming pain  
Tossing and turning all night and waking wide up  
Now I'm really looking at the door should've made this move before  
I can't take this anymore  
I don't want no more nightmares in the night  
No not tonight  
I already seen the light

If you don't let yourself go once or twice  
Nobody's giving me better advice  
Show what you're feeling  
You wouldn't be stealing

The night we've waited for so long it seems  
Has come, to make us crazy, and we got  
No place to hide  
Heroes and virgins baby  
Life gets so urgent baby  
Being your friend has been very nice  
But I don't want to be after tonight  
The moon is giving us its perfect light  
The radio's beating  
And the words keep repeating

Never fade away  
Tears of joy for the promises  
That will come again someday  
When you walked out it was unexpected  
I'm trying to find my way back to you

Two thin white lines between where you are and where you should be

But then you come crashing down and you're asleep on the ground  
A king without his crown  
Chorus:  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
Anymore, not ever  
This park is an island in a sea of despair  
In the heart of the city of angels who aren't even there  
I see you praying for hope while you keep worshipping dope  
The devil right by your side and I see death in your eyes  
Will you live or do you have the will to die

I want to do things before they become  
The things I should have done in my life

There ain't no pain

One summer morning  
I was left  
But I don't know  
One summer morning  
So all alone

Down from the mountain  
Along with the breezes  
So close inside

Won't you please send it home to me

Whisper good evening  
I turned to a shadow  
And saw her there  
So all alone  
She had those sad china eyes  
That sang each time she smiled  
Ah, but the song  
It seemed to linger  
So long it deepened  
My love for her  
Until she called me near  
And then we waltzed to our heart beat  
All around  
The sea was swaying  
The breeze was praying  
Never to leave her alone  
Alone  
Oh, the time just slipped on by  
And with the time  
So did our love  
Ah, her every move  
Just like a fever  
Just like a fever  
Burnin' inside would not leave me

The juggling clown smiles to me  
And every frown we agree is glad  
The nighttime comes to bring the bums  
From Bowery heat to crimson streets of wine  
But magic lands will never touch our sands  
  
Your children smile in single file  
They learn mistakes that others make  
They see although they cannot know  
The needs they'll need to have their greed grow wild  
But dance and sing, for others bring the shame  
And for a while you won't know my name

Tim Buckley,Goodbye And Hello,/t/tim+buckley/goodbye+hello_20137248.html,"The antique people are down in the dungeons  
Run by machines and afraid of the tax  
Their heads in the grave and their hands on their eyes  
Hauling their hearts around circular tracks  
Pretending forever their masquerade towers  
Are not really riddled with widening cracks  
And I wave goodbye to iron  
And smile hello to the air  
  
O the new children dance -- I am young  
All around the balloons -- I will live  
Swaying by chance -- I am strong  
To the breeze from the moon -- I can give  
Painting the sky -- You the strange  
With the colors of sun -- Seed of day  
Freely they fly -- Feel the change  
As all become one -- Know the Way  
  
The velocity addicts explode on the highways  
Ignoring the journey and moving so fast  
Their nerves fall apart and they gasp but can't breathe  
They run from the cops of the skeleton past  
Petrified by tradition in a nightmare they stagger  
  
Into nowhere at all and they look up aghast  
And I wave goodbye to speed  
And smile hello to a rose  
  
O the new children play -- I am young  
Under the juniper trees -- I will live  
Sky blue or gray -- I am strong  
They continue at ease -- I can give  
Moving so slow -- You the strange  
That serenely they can -- Seed of day  
Gracefully grow -- Feel the change  
And yes still understand -- Know the Way  
  
The king and the queen in their castle of billboards  
Sleepwalk down the hallways dragging behind  
All their possessions and transient treasures  
As they go to worship the electronic shrine  
On which is playing the late late commercial  
In that hollowest house of the opulent blind  
And I wave goodbye to Mammon  
And smile hello to a stream  
  
O the new children buy -- I am young  
All the world for a song -- I will live  
Without a dime -- I am strong  
To which they belong -- I can give  
Nobody owns -- You the strange  
Anything anywhere -- Seed of day  
Everyone's grown -- Feel the change  
Up so big they can share -- Know the Way  
  
The vaudeville generals cavort on the stage  
And shatter their audience with submachine guns  
And Freedom and Violence the acrobat clowns  
Do a balancing act on the graves of our sons  
While the tapdancing Emperor sings ""War is peace""  
And Love the Magician disappears in the fun  
And I wave goodbye to murder  
And smile hello to the rain  
  
O the new children can't -- I am young  
Tell a foe from a friend -- I will live  
Quick to enchant -- I am strong  
And so glad to extend -- I can give  
Handfuls of dawn -- You the strange  
To kaleidoscope men -- Seed of day  
Come from beyond -- Feel the change  
The Great Wall of Skin -- Know the Way  
  
The bloodless husbands are jesters who listen  
Like sheep to the shrieks and commands of their wives  
And the men who aren't men leave the women alone  
See them all faking love on a bed made of knives  
Afraid to discover or trust in their bodies  
And in secret divorce they will never survive  
And I wave goodbye to ashes  
And smile hello to a girl  
  
O the new children kiss -- I am young  
They are so proud to learn -- I will live  
Womanwood bliss -- I am strong  
And the manfire that burns -- I can give  
Knowing no fear -- You the strange  
They take off their clothes -- Seed of day  
Honest and clear - Feel the change  
As a river that flows - Know the Way  
  
The antique people are fading out slowly  
Like newspapers flaming in mind suicide  
Godless and sexless directionless loons  
Their sham sandcastles dissolve in the tide  
They put on their deathmasks and compromise daily  
The new children will live for the elders have died  
And I wave goodbye to America  
And smile hello to the world

And sing my love and sing my love  
I wanna sing it high, sing it down low

Well then i guess it's just you and me brother  
All alone in this cold world  
All alone in this cold world  
  
Ah, you gotta go upon a mountain  
And learn to sing your love, learn to sing your love  
You know i can sing it high, sing it down low

Wash down the city skies

Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache  
He begs for just a smile  
O he never asked to be her mountain  
He never asked to fly  
And through his eye he comes his love  
And tells her not to cry  
  
She says, ""Your scoundrel father flies  
With a dancer called a queen  
And with her stolen cards he plays  
And laughs, but never wins""  
O the child dreams to be his hands  
In the counting of the rain  
But only barren breasts he feels  
For her milk will never drain  
  
As I die I can't remember  
Where I saw the rain:  
Could it be that her laughter  
Drove me down again?  
Charming dancer will you stop,  
Stop and talk to me?  
Is there someone else you feel  
In your dreams? you will, you see:  
In midnight gazes  
I've found you far from me:  
If you lead me on  
Please leave me down

Please flutter by my door:  
Yes you can drink my lies  
If first you read my eyes:  
Each one is titled  
""I'm drowning back to you"":  
I can't swim your waters  
And you can't walk my lands:  
I'm sailing all my sins  
And I'm climbing all my fears

Tim Buckley,Wings,/t/tim+buckley/wings_10232094.html,"Although you've spoken many times before  
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And all you need is the warmth of his hand  
And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance  
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance  
And now you know you cannot live alone  
But you will find your future is unknown  
One day the questions rise, on wings of chance you fly  
And on that day your laughs and tears will die  
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies  
And you will love when love comes your way  
And when it comes there's nothing more to say  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And now you know you don't need his hand  
One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly

And there you were on isle 13.  
I felt that old rush, when you saw me you blushed  
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen.  
They said you looked lost on the dance floor,  
With a lonely look in your eyes.  
Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know  
For once I wish I hadn't thought twice.  
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado,  
And I headed out to Tennessee.  
Heard you got married and you moved back home,  
Here we are again, you and me.  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.  
Annie, I owe you a dance.  
  
Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye,  
Yeah loves, I've had a few.  
I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,  
But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you.  
Remember how we'd talk for hours, keeping each other's secrets,  
Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,  
But Annie I didn't keep it.  
Almost called you up, when I played it bolder,  
But I thought I'd just let it be.  
Heard you found yourself a real good man,  
Do you ever think of you and me?  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.

So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking  
Like I should have twenty years ago.  
And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure,  
And there's a song on the radio.  
You give me your hand and we start to dance,  
The cashier gives us a smile.  
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say  
""Momma, who was that guy?""  
I shouldn't be surprised, look forgiveness in your eyes,  
Gave me a second chance.  
Annie, thanks for the dance.

Tryin' to make a life anywhere else  
This would be your home  
And I was on my own  
  
But ever since you said good bye  
I've been out here on the wind  
And baby you would be surprised  
All the places you have been  
I've seen you in

Albuquerque  
Waitin' out a blizzard  
Arizona  
Dancin' 'cross the desert  
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey  
Girl I swear just the other day you were  
Down in Georgia  
Pickin' them peaches  
In Carolina  
Barefoot on the beaches  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
  
Everywhere  
  
Now days  
When I'm passin' through  
The conversation always turns to you  
And I hear you're doin' fine  
Livin' out by the county line  
Got a man that's home every night  
A couple of kids and the kind of life  
That you want to lead  
Guess you could say the same for me  
But you and I  
Made our choices  
All those years ago  
Still I know  
I'll hear your voice  
And see you down the road  
  
Maybe in  
Oklahoma  
Drivin' 'cross the prairie  
In Dallas, Texas  
Isn't that where we  
Always said we would  
Like to try  
Never did  
So maybe that's why you're on  
Every highway  
Just beyond the high-beams  
Right beside me  
In all of my sweet dreams  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
In

And he drank his whiskey straight  
He would fight every night  
If he didn't get his way  
She was kind she could find  
All the good in everyone  
And then one day she passed his way  
He felt reborn in that morning sun  
He saw her face she caught his name  
And from that moment  
He knew he'd never be the same  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Now I've been down kicked around  
The world had got the best of me  
Out of rope little hope  
I never get back on my feet  
She took my hand said yes you can  
One look at her and I'm a brand new man  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Oh when I feel the need for inspiration  
With just one look I found my salvation  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
See the man you want to be  
See the man see the man you want to be

And she was mine for a little while

She's gone but she left me with a smile

Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town  
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down  
But I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow  
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when  
It matters, but didn't back then

I'm only Jesus  
  
Johnny had a good job  
Rackin' it in  
Caviar parties  
With his well to do friends  
Something was missing  
From his perfect little life  
He through in the towel  
And he called me one night  
  
Betty was an orphan  
Like so many kids  
They taught her in school  
That I didn't exist  
She had every reason not to talk to me  
But every night before bed  
She got down on her knees  
Just to tell me hi  
  
And I said,  
I'm sure glad you believe  
Cause everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Hey your all the same to me  
Everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
I'm only Jesus  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Gotta have Jesus to see the light  
Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight  
Gotta have Jesus to talk to me  
I gotta have Jesus to set me free

She's one of a kind  
  
All my friends call me Bear Claw

He gets his orders from my maw-may

I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom  
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some  
Hey and pass it around

We can ride my pony double  
Make your little heart bubble

He caught runnin' water in my hands  
Drug me 'round by my headband  
Said I wasn't the kind

I can kill a deer or buffalo  
With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards don't you know  
I do it all the time

Late at night tryin' to catch a peek  
At me in nothin' but my buffalo briefs  
I got em standin' in line

His folks were divorced  
His old man high on something  
Came knocking at the door  
His mama wouldn't talk to him  
She said boy dontcha let him in  
  
She was cussing and pacing and wasting her life  
On that linoleum floor  
He took him back to his old apartment  
Turned off the TV  
His beautiful broken hero on the couch  
Passed out asleep  
And he put 'em to bed  
With tears in his eyes  
He said dad I love you, goodbye  
  
He headed out into the night  
Seventeen years old  
Fired up that rusty old pickup  
Turned his collar to the cold  
And he headed back to mama's place  
Ready for his big escape  
And he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note  
In the cover's fold  
  
It said mom I wish I could wave a wand  
And make you smile again  
Bring back the man who stole your heart  
'Fore the demons got to him  
If I stay here any longer  
Something sacred's gonna die  
He said mom I love you, goodbye  
  
Took a lot of wrong turns on the road  
Finding his life  
By the grace of God he ended up  
With a little boy and a wife  
And the phone call came from his sister  
It was that old familiar pain  
His mother was at the doorstep  
Of heaven's pure white light  
  
At the end of the service  
His father came up to him  
Clear eyed and sober now he said  
Boy Jesus took my sins  
And I pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too  
With tears in his eyes  
He said son I love you, goodbye  
  
His plane touched down in Texas  
He pulled out his phone  
Dialed in the number, got the machine  
Of his old man's home  
He said dad we got an extra room  
And your grandson has your eyes  
Couldn't say anything else  
Cause he started to cry  
And he choked out dad I love you, goodbye  
  
Dad I love you, goodbye

Tim McGraw,Mary And Joseph,/t/tim+mcgraw/mary+and+joseph_21052789.html,"Mary was the first of three  
Long black hair and sugar sweet  
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile  
  
She was barely seventeen  
Got a job keepin' dishes clean  
Planned to stay in this city for a while  
For a while  
  
Joseph ran a lumber yard  
About a mile from Olive park  
Quiet boy, he never had much to say  
  
It was love right from the start  
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart  
Had hopes for a home and kids someday  
Kids someday  
  
The angel scared her half to death  
She would've screamed but she lost her breath  
On a midnight there in the middle of May  
  
He said ""Oh Mary, don't be afraid  
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made  
Name him Jesus, He'll light the way""  
  
She packed the clothes, he made the plans  
They had to go to Bethlehem  
But there was nowhere left to stay  
  
So in a barn she gave birth  
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth  
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay  
Sleeping on the hay  
  
The story's too long to tell  
But He walked on water and lived through hell  
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave  
  
We got a King, they got a Son  
Mary and Joseph were the only ones  
There on that very first Christmas day  
There on that very first Christmas day

I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right

And leave that truck out by the curb  
The TV and the phones packed up, so we won't be disturbed  
There's not a light left in this room, just a shadow of a doubt  
So let's make sure we don't give up  
Before we've thought this through enough

Dump this truck and the little I've got

Tim McGraw,Real Good Man,/t/tim+mcgraw/real+good+man_20137411.html,"Girl, you've never known no one like me  
Up there in your high society  
They might tell you I'm no good  
Girl they need to understand  
Just who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
I may be a real bad boy  
But baby I'm a real good man  
  
I may drink too much and play too loud  
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd  
That don't mean I don't respect  
My mama and my Uncle Sam  
Yes sir, yes ma'am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Might have a reckless streak  
At least a country mile wide  
If you're gonna run with me  
It's gonna be a wild ride  
When it comes to lovin' you  
I've got velvet hands  
I'll show you how a real bad boy  
Can be a real good man  
  
I'll take all the good times I can get  
I'm too young for growing up just yet  
Ain't much I can promise you  
Except to do the best I can  
I'll be damned

Tim McGraw,Red Rag Top,/t/tim+mcgraw/red+rag+top_20137412.html,"I was twenty and she was eighteen  
We were just about as wild as we were green  
In the ways of the world  
She'd pick me up in that red rag top  
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops  
On a summer night  
Running all the red lights  
We'd park way out in a clearing in a grove  
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove  
We were cooking with gas  
Knew it had to last  
  
[Chorus]  
In the back of that red rag top  
She said please don't stop  
  
Well the very first time her mother met me  
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be  
For two weeks  
I was out of job and she was in school  
And life was fast and the world was cruel  
We were young and wild  
We decided not to have the child  
So we did what we did and we tried to forget  
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets  
In the morning light  
But on the way home that night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We took one more trip around the sun  
But it was all make believe in the end  
And no I can't say where she is today  
I can't remember who I was back then  
  
Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins  
And there's no such thing as what might have been  
That's a waste of time  
Drive you out of your mind  
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday  
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet  
And her eyes were green  
And I was in an old scene  
  
[Chorus]  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me

Sellin' beer to the locals, just barely gettin' by  
On the tips from the rich kids, their on Daddy's dime  
But when I saw her walk in one night  
I knew that I'd be alright in...  
  
[Chorus]  
Telluride  
The snow fallin' down  
I was wakin' up with her in that sleepy little town  
In her eyes my world came so alive  
  
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride  
  
We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire  
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall, drownin' in desire  
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud  
So high up on that mountain  
I thought we'd never come down  
It was a dream we were livin' in  
And I was the happiest I'd ever been, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telleride  
  
It ended just like a movie scene  
And I had to play the part  
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave  
And me with the frozen heart, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I never will forget the day she said good bye, in Telluride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride

My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took  
And I'm proud to be my daddy's son  
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit  
Until the job's done  
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one  
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun  
We live out in the country where we're free to roam  
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home  
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe  
  
The way I believe

Where the kids hang around the pizza hut parking lot  
Everybody talks a lot, no one likes to do, no  
And all the cub scout leaders at the local theaters  
Said you couldn't sing a song that well  
You told 'em all to go to hell

But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up

Mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  
In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace  
His old man woke him up to help him find the car  
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  
He swore that he was quitting, and then he'd start to cry  
And though the boy knew the truth, sometimes he'd still believe that lie  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
All you do is crawl when you want to run  
God gave boys their mammas  
'Cause they always see their promise  
And they help them understand  
How to walk like man  
Walk like a man  
  
They moved a lot of places, they never settled down  
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town

Tim McGraw,Wouldn't Want It Any Other Way,/t/tim+mcgraw/wouldnt+want+it+any+other+way_20137367.html,"Without me  
Maybe you'd find somebody else  
A little wiser  
With a lot more wealth  
And without you  
It's true I'd be free  
To go chasing all my dreams  
Without any strings  
  
But I wouldn't want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldn't want it any other way  
  
Hard times  
May never let up on us  
And maybe all we'll ever have  
Will barely be enough  
And babe you know  
How cold the wind can blow  
Love's never let us down  
When we needed it the most  
  
And I wouldn't want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldn't want it any other way

Do you remember me  
I think we might've met somewhere before  
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind  
But hey I guess you never really can be sure  
  
Oh there's nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore  
  
Then an old familiar feeling  
Wraps its arms around the moment  
And he says so many times I've tried to call  
Well you'd think it's been a lifetime  
It's been two years since I've seen you  
But it seems just like no time's gone by at all  
  
Oh there's nothing like a real love  
To give you back the feel of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore  
  
Oh and how far we'll travel  
For a place to heal our hearts  
We watched it unravel  
To why's tonight the hardest part  
  
Then he says the weather's changin'  
And it's icin' up the highway  
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road  
So she says good-bye and then before  
She knows what she is sayin' she says  
I wish you didn't have to go  
  
Oh there's nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before

Album: Wildest Dreams (96)  
  
There's a time for love and a time for healing  
Can't go back and undo what's been done  
The word of mouth, time is revealing  
Just how far we've left this kingdom come  
Hand in hand we're finding our way  
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Kiss of life and the hand of fate  
Boy grows up into his father's son  
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate  
To carry on the way it had been done  
All our lives, it's debts to repay  
Maybe someday we can put the past away  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Put your fear away, find a better way  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Underneath a broken sky  
Love can heal the pain inside  
In a moment things can change  
One look behind and it's never the same

Ain't no mountain too high

In a world of hidden danger  
Don't want to be all alone

Gotta reach inside and find the strength to pull you through

Their hearts full of joy  
They ask now for guidance  
Reaching out to the skies up above

In this world we remain truly  
Brothers all the same  
  
Give us wisdom to pass to each other  
Give us strength so we understand  
That the things we do  
The choices we make  
Give direction to all life's plans  
  
To look in wonder  
At all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
Every corner we turn  
Only leads to another  
A journey ends, but another begins

It ain't over, it's only love  
And that's all  
  
When your heart has been broken  
Hard words have been spoken  
It ain't easy, but it's only love  
And if your life ain't worth living  
And you're ready to give in  
Just remember that it's only love  
Yeah, that's all  
  
You can live without the aggravation  
You gotta want to win, you gotta want to win  
You keep looking back in desperation  
Over and over and over again

Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of his eyes  
  
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin  
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been  
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying  
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Coming close together  
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time  
He ain't ashamed to be a man or afraid to be a friend

Helpless, caught by the melody

Have you ever felt that you weren't responsible for the things that you do?  
When the girl that you are with is just too much  
She is so out of sight, baby, that all you can say is:  
Well, all right!  
  
I'm not responsible, not responsible  
For anything I do when I'm with you  
I'm not responsible, it's impossible  
To be so very near and not feel part of you  
You've got such a hold on me  
You make it seem so easy, but it's true, oh yeah  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too  
  
Whoa..oa, baby, all right

And I dreamed about those cotton fields at home.  
I dreamed about my mother,  
Dear old papa, sister and brother,  
  
I dreamed about that girl  
Who's been waiting for so long.  
I wanna go home, I wanna go home,  
Oh, how I wanna go home!  
  
Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City.  
From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine.  
But by day, I make the cars,  
And by night I make the bars,  
If only they could read between the lines!  
  
[Spoken]  
  
You know,  
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City.  
After all these years,  
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.  
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride,  
Put on a south bound freight and ride,  
Goin' back to the love ones,  
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.  
  
I wanna go home, I wanna go home,  
Oh, how I want to go home.

Tom Lehrer,"Fight Fiercely, Harvard!",/t/tom+lehrer/fight+fiercely+harvard_20138406.html,"Now we come to that peculiar bit of Americana known as the football fight
song. I was reminded not too long ago, upon returning from my lesson with the
Scrabble pro at the Harvard club in Boston, of the days of my undergraduacy
long ago when there used to be these very long Saturday afternoons in the fall
with nothing to do - the library was closed - just waiting around for the
cocktail parties to begin. And on occasions like that, some of us used to
wander over to the...I believe it was called the stadium, to see if anything
might be going on over there. And one did come to realize that the football
fight songs that one hears in comparable stadia have a tendency to be somewhat
uncouth, and even violent, and that it would be refreshing, to say the least,
to find one that was a bit more genteel. And here it is, dedicated to my own
alma mater, and called Fight Fiercely, Harvard.  
  
Fight fiercely, Harvard, fight, fight, fight!  
Demonstrate to them our skill.  
Albeit they possess the might,  
Nonetheless we have the will.  
  
How we will celebrate our victory,  
We shall invite the whole team up for tea. (How jolly!)  
Hurl that spheroid down the field,  
And fight, fight, fight!  
  
Fight fiercely, Harvard, fight, fight, fight!  
Impress them with our prowess, do!  
Oh, fellas, do not let the crimson down,  
Be of stout heart and true.

various types of songs that we all know and presumably love, and, as it were,
to kick them when they're down. I find that if you take the various popular

the ridiculous to the obscene, or - as they say in New York - ""sophisticated"".
I'd like to illustrate with several hundred examples for you this evening,
first of all, the southern type song about the wonders of the American south.

enough. The following song, on the other hand, goes too far. It's called I

(rover was killed by a pontiac. and it was done with  
Such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the  
Driver both ears and the tail - but I digress.)  
The moment had come,  
I swallowed my gum,  
We knew there'd be blood on the sand pretty soon.  
The crowd held it's breath,  
Hoping that death  
Would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon.  
At last, the matador did what we wanted him to.  
He raised his sword and his aim was true.  
In that moment of truth I suddenly knew  
That someone had stolen my wallet.  
Now it's fiesta time in akron, ohio,  
But it's back to old guadalajara I'm longing to go.  
Far away from the strikes of the a.f. of l. and c.i.o.  
How I wish I could get back  
To the land of the wetback,  
And forget the alamo,  
In old mexico. ole!

Back to the place where no one wears a frown,  
To see once more those super-special just plain folks  
In my home town.  
No fellow could ignore  
The little girl next door,  
She sure looked sweet in her first evening gown.  
Now there's a charge for what she used to give for free  
In my home town.  
I remember dan, the druggist on the corner, 'e  
Was never mean or ornery,  
He was swell.  
He killed his mother-in-law and ground her up real well,  
And sprinkled just a bit  
Over each banana split.  
The guy that taught us math,  
Who never took a bath,  
Acquired a certain measure of renown,  
And after school he sold the most amazing pictures  
In my home town.  
That fellow was no fool  
Who taught our Sunday school,  
And neither was our kindly parson brown.  
We're recording tonight so I have to leave this line out.  
In my home town.  
I remember sam, he was the village idiot.  
And though it seems a pity, it  
Was so.  
He loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow,  
And nothing could be done,  
Because he was the mayor's son.  
The guy that took a knife  
And monogrammed his wife,  
Then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown.  
Oh, yes indeed, the people there are just plain folks  
In my home town.

Tom Lehrer,National Brotherhood Week,/t/tom+lehrer/national+brotherhood+week_20138394.html,"One week of every year is designated National Brotherhood Week. This is just
one of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes. One of my favorites is
National Make-fun-of-the-handicapped Week which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis
are in charge of as you know. During National Brotherhood Week various special
events are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood. This year, for
example, on the first day of the week Malcolm X was killed which gives you an
idea of how effective the whole thing is. I'm sure we all agree that we ought
to love one another and I know there are people in the world that do not love
their fellow human beings and I hate people like that. Here's a song about
National Brotherhood Week.  
  
Oh, the white folks hate the black folks,  
And the black folks hate the white folks.  
To hate all but the right folks  
Is an old established rule.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
Lena Horne and Sheriff Clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.  
It's fun to eulogize  
The people you despise,  
As long as you don't let 'em in your school.  
  
Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks,  
And the rich folks hate the poor folks.  
All of my folks hate all of your folks,  
It's American as apple pie.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans 'cause it's very chic.  
Step up and shake the hand  
Of someone you can't stand.  
You can tolerate him if you try.  
  
Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics,  
And the Catholics hate the Protestants,  
And the Hindus hate the Moslems,  
And everybody hates the Jews.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
It's National Everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood Week.  
Be nice to people who  
Are inferior to you.  
It's only for a week, so have no fear.  
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year!

Tom Lehrer,Poisoning Pigeons In The Park,/t/tom+lehrer/poisoning+pigeons+in+the+park_20138386.html,"Spring is here, spring is here  
Life is skittles and life is beer  
I think the loveliest time of the year  
Is the spring, I do, don't you? Course you do  
But there's one thing that makes spring complete for me  
And makes every Sunday a treat for me  
  
All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon  
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
Every Sunday you'll see my sweetheart and me  
As we poison the pigeons in the park  
  
When they see us coming  
The birdies all try and hide  
But they still go for peanuts  
When coated with cyanide  
  
The sun's shining bright  
Everything seems all right  
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
We've gained notoriety  
And caused much anxiety  
In the Audobon Society  
With our games  
They call it impiety  
And lack of propriety  
And quite a variety of unpleasant names  
  
But it's not against any religion  
To want to dispose of a pigeon  
  
So if Sunday you're free  
Why don't you come with me  
And we'll poison the pigeons in the park  
And maybe we'll do in a squirrel or two  
While we're poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
We'll murder them amid laughter and merriment  
Except for the few we take home to experiment  
  
My pulse will be quickenin'  
With each drop of strychnine  
We feed to a pigeon  
It just takes a smidgin  
To poison a pigeon in the park

Tom Lehrer,Smut,/t/tom+lehrer/smut_20138398.html,"I do have a cause, though, it is obscenity. I'm for it! (laughter) Thank you.  
Unfortunately, the civil liberties types who are fighting this issue have to
fight it,  
Owing to the nature of the laws,  
As a matter of freedom of speech and stifling of free expression and so on.  
  
But we know what's really involved: dirty books are fun!  
That's all there is to it.  
But you can't get up in a court and say that,  
I suppose.  
  
It's simply a matter of freedom of pleasure,  
a right which is not guaranteed by the Constitution, unfortunately.  
Anyway, since people seem to be marching for their causes these days,  
I have here a march for mine. It's called:  
  
Smut!  
Give me smut and nothing but!  
A dirty novel I can't shut  
If it's uncut  
And unsubt-le.  
  
I've never quibbled  
If it was ribald.  
I would devour  
Where others merely nibbled.  
  
As the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my Aunt Hortense,  
""To be smut  
It must be ut-  
Terly without redeeming social importance.""  
  
Por-  
Nographic pictures I adore.  
Indecent magazines galore,  
I like them more  
If they're hardcore.  
  
Bring on the obscene movies, murals, postcards, neckties, samplers, stained  
Glass windows, tattoos, anything!  
More, more, I'm still not satisfied!  
  
Stories of tortures  
Used by debauchers  
Lurid, licentious and vile,  
Make me smile.  
  
Novels that pander  
To my taste for candor  
Give me a pleasure sublime.  
Let's face it I love slime!  
  
Old books can be indecent books,  
Though recent books are bolder.  
For filth, I'm glad to say,  
Is in the mind of the beholder.  
  
When correctly viewed,  
Everything is lewd.  
I could tell you things about Peter Pan  
And the Wizard of Oz - there's a dirty old man!  
  
I thrill  
To any book like Fanny Hill,  
And I suppose I always will  
If it is swill  
And really fil-thy.  
  
Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately?  
I've got a hobby: rereading Lady Chatterley.  
But now they're trying to take it all away from us unless  
We take a stand, and hand in hand we fight for freedom of the press.  
  
In other words: Smut! I love it.  
Ah, the adventures of a slut.  
Oh, I'm a market they can't glut.  
I don't know what  
Compares with smut.  
Hip, hip, hooray!  
Let's hear it for the Supreme Court!  
Don't let them take it away!

Not to mention other adjec-

But don't you worry.  
No more ashes, no more sackcloth.  
And an armband made of black cloth  
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve.  
For if the bomb that drops on you  
Gets your friends and neighbors too,  
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve.  
And we will all go together when we go.  
What a comforting fact that is to know.  
Universal bereavement,  
An inspiring achievement,  
Yes, we all will go together when we go.  
We will all go together when we go.  
All suffuse with an incandescent glow.  
No one will have the endurance  
To collect on his insurance,  
Lloyd's of london will be loaded when they go.  
Oh we will all fry together when we fry.  
We'll be french fried potatoes by and by.  
There will be no more misery  
When the world is our rotisserie,  
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry.  
Down by the old maelstrom,  
There'll be a storm before the calm.  
And we will all bake together when we bake.  
There'll be nobody present at the wake.  
With complete participation  
In that grand incineration,  
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak.  
Oh we will all char together when we char.  
And let there be no moaning of the bar.  
Just sing out a te deum  
When you see that I.c.b.m.,  
And the party will be ""come as you are.""  
Oh we will all burn together when we burn.  
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn.  
When it's time for the fallout  
And saint peter calls us all out,  
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn.  
You will all go directly to your respective valhallas.  
Go directly, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dolla's.  
And we will all go together when we go.  
Ev'ry hottenhot and ev'ry eskimo.

He built the cradles and the furniture for the schools

You could take him a picture from a catalog he could build anything he'd see  
He could make anything that you could make out of the tree  
One day Bill said Mama I'm gettin' old I want you to measure me good  
I'm goin' out to that wood pile and get myself some wood  
And I'm gonna make me a coffin I want it to fit me fine

time

And some were wanted inside your walls  
And for the 22 year old college girl  
Who made that last semester with her smile along your halls  
And for the traveling salesman and the Friday night time dinner out time crowd  
Some were seeking stimulation in the laughter noise and drinks the music loud  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the

And for the Wednesday Night Auxiliary that meets inside your banquet room at
nine  
For the women's club and the social leads and the regular attendants every
time  
For the lost abandoned child by your northside entrance left alone to die  
For the long haired wide eyed boy selling dope and looking for a place to hide  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
  
For the middle aged executive who thought he'd seen enough  
To slash his wrist in No 10  
And for the 32 year old housewife who got caught with her best friend's
husband  
She ain't around to try again  
For the 7 year old girl swingin' slidin' on the west side near the pool  
Saying why couldn't dad come home with us mama  
Why you got to put me in that school

This day and time a little thing you do could mean so much

But an old love don't need that smile it glows with just a touch

We'll get our check on Monday, tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off

Burnin' in that ol' warm mornin' stove it sure smelled good  
Daddy couldn't get work then and I was just a child  
And God was on vacation for awhile  
""Well, if you see Fred you tell him I'll come help him kill them hogs  
And ask him if he'd still be interested in my dogs  
Don't hang around that pool room all day, we might get more snow

To tell the truth I guess we ate 'em all in '49

The prettiest music you have ever heard here's how to make friends with the
bird  
First you get some peanut butter out of a jar  
And you can buy a bag of bird seed anywhere  
You mix it all together and you put it on the ground  
And pretty soon the birds come around  
Everybody loves to hear...  
Some people buy spray and they spray it on the land  
They kill all the little bitty bugs that they can  
The birds eat up the bugs and it makes them sick I wish we didn't have to do
that  
Cause everybody loves to hear...  
Right now you're young and you're not very tall  
You're really very busy and you're rally very small  
Someday when you're older and things go wrong you've gotta need a pretty bird

say  
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.""  
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a

And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down?  
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar

I wish I had a million friends and the frog that goes ribbit in the pool

One for the morning and the noon and the night  
A monkey and a zebra and a big white horse oh boy

Shaking that old road dust off my heels I give my heart and mind the chance to
heal  
Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again  
More than likely ride back to the places I have been  
In fairness to my music and my friends so I'll go somewhere and sing my songs
again  
A raccoon stole my minnows in the night I appreciate his need and his appetite  
But like me he doesn't have to roam Lord it's true that man can't live on
bread alone  
So I'll go somewhere  
  
Oh it feels so good to have a simple wish where life and death is me and some
old fish  
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand  
And he surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand  
So I'll go somewhere

I had come to Des Moines for a radio show  
I awoke in the evening from a traveler's sleep  
With notions of something to eat  
  
The old elevator slid down past the floors  
My head and my eyes said ""You should have slept more.""  
The man at the desk said the restaurant was closed  
Outside it was 14 below  
  
The lounge was still open and so I walked in  
In place of my food I had two double gins  
I looked 'round the room, as a tourist would do  
That's when I saw the girl in the booth  
  
She sat there and cried in the smoky half-dark  
The silent type crying that tears out your heart  
Her clothes were not cut in the new modern way  
And her suitcase had seen better days  
  
Nobody asked her what caused her such pain  
Nobody spoke up, yet no one complained  
Without even asking, I knew why she cried  
Life is just like that sometimes  
  
The man at the desk said, ""It's 15 below.""  
The bellhop said ""Yeah man, that's cold...that's cold.""  
I went back to my room and I wrote down this song  
Oh it sure can get cold in Des Moines

Where life's sendin' me I guess

Written on an artificial high  
Carry water from the well until you know  
That all the children are refreshed

We were drinking too much yesterday  
Nobody's ever told us what's enough  
The ones that we should've prayed for more than likely  
Were the ones we had to cuss  
They applauded as we killed ourselves  
But angels don't have bourbon on their breath  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
They came to see the people that they thought we were  
And never changed their minds  
They explained the way that difference caused  
The folks who love a picker can be blind  
They misunderstood the words but understood  
That our intentions were the best  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
What a picker does for others is the thing  
He's mainly doing for himself  
There were friends and there were neighbors  
But the good homes that we came from didn't help

About us after we have gone to rest  
We would like someone to mention all the good folks

And like all newly weds they had their hopes and dreams  
And one night in a snowstorm so the story went  
She lost her loving husband in an accident

And all she did was think of him and walk the floor  
She'd lie there in her bed at night alone and cold  
Until one day she joined the highway state patrol

And others say she don't work when the weather's fair  
But when the weather's bad she's on the air all night  
Begging us to slow down till the weather's right

I've picked up the Bible and looked through it I found the stock of letters
tied in blue  
The letters had been left there by a young girl there were ten and as I read
the first  
I found that they were from a boy in Detroit  
Who'd sent for her as soon as he got work  
The first one mentioned her expected baby  
The one and two and three were much the same  
The fourth and fifth said that he might send to get her  
The sixth and seventh offered her his name  
The eighth and ninth were weeks apart in postmark  
They were short and asked about her help  
The tenth one was a tear stained on the pages  
Said that he had married someone else  
Next morning I felt guilty when I checked out  
As the highway people cleared away the snow  
I asked about the girl who used to live there  
They said she passed away three weeks ago  
Well I kept the letters but I never read them  
Oh but somewhere up in Detroit there's a man  
Who heard what happened down in West Virginia

I'll never forget her, I guess  
She preached each Sunday morning on the local radio  
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress  
  
She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault  
But I will admit she knew the Bible well  
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use  
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell  
  
She had a guitar picker by the name of Luther Short  
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin  
She would turn and smile at Luther when the program would commence  
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn  
  
I was picking for her too with what we call the doghouse bass  
I clung to every word that passed her lips  
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come  
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips  
  
The Lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached  
But ol' Luther took her home each Sunday morn'  
Looking back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride  
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born  
  
Sometimes ol' Luther showed up at the studio half-tight  
And smoking was a thing he liked to do  
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me  
I told her in a way that I'd been praying for her too  
  
One Sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone  
Said she and brother Luther had a call  
I can see me standing in that studio that day  
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all  
  
I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since  
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room  
I know ol' Luther Short and he's a hard ol' boy to change

We used to go out courtin' along October Hill

And these friends of mine came up and brought me this real old book  
About John Henry and they told me if they let me read this old book I'd  
Probably write a song about it.  
And they did and I did and I called it more About John Henry.)  
  
First of all John Henry was a black man  
He was born where the sun don't ever shine  
He was six feet tall he didn't know his own strength  
But he did not swing the hammer all the time  
Of course he didn't John Henry had some women on his mind.  
  
There was a woman cross the street named Poor Selma  
Loved John Henry like a natural man  
John Henry quit Poor Selma just like he was quitting work  
He loved that stinger of Julie Anne  
And what is it a stinger is something else you understand.  
  
There was a man named Stacker Lee in Argenta a little man with a big 44  
You know he shot his woman down and took a shot at Poor Selma  
But ol' Stacker won't be shooting anymore  
He had to quit it John Henry laid him dead on the floor.  
  
John Henry threw Stacker Lee in the river  
Then he said I've got a say so to say  
He broke out in a song that was wrote by Blind Leonard  
He said Julie Anne I'm singing my say  
He said I love you but I do not like your lowdown ways.  
  
Well, John Henry went to a conjuring woman  
Said this misery ain't no way to live  
Somebody's back door creeping on my pretty Julie Anne  
Conjure woman had a say so to give  
She said, ""John Henry."" she said, ""That's just the way things is.""  
  
Well, John Henry went to a hell busting man  
Said I'm tormented deep in my soul  
Well, that hell buster prayed John Henry's sins away  
And they tell me that the thunder did roll  
Sweet Jesus what a frightening sight to behold.  
  
From that day on John Henry was a changed man  
All he did was just work all the time  
Well, he worked till the muscles in his body gave out  
Then he kept right on a working in his mind  
Don't do it cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time.  
  
Julie Anne said John Henry I love you  
Poor Selma said John Henry you're my man  
Ruby said I'm gonna cook ye up some greens and some lean meat  
With corn bread in a four foot pan  
With lots of cracklings but John Henry was a different kinda man.  
  
Well, they allow that hard work killed John Henry,  
I'm gonna leave that allowing up to you,  
Well, was he killed by hard work or was he killed by bad women  
Be sure that this ain't happening to you.  
  
Quit working when your day's work work is through  
Cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time  
And ain't that just the way the things is  
A stinger is something else you understand  
Quit working when your your day's work is through God bless you

And even though he had his faults he was a sight to see  
He taught the show dog puppies to always try and please  
To hold their heads and tails up and not wet the judge's knees  
Ole George was not a champion but his owners loved him so  
They drived the car to the dogshows ole George would get the dough  
But when he'd get out in the rain he never could win first  
Several judges shook their heads and said he was the worst  
Then one day the kannel keeper got an urgent call  
From the local TV to Mr Tom T Hall  
They said Johnny Cash is puttin' on the show tonight  
He says he needs a basset you've got one ain't that right  
Lonesome George went to the show and he did everything  
He barked and growled and jumped around and made the rappers ring  
He'd left the people cheering for another curtain call  
And so ole lonesome George became the show dog after all mhm

If you hold love too tightly, it will die

'Pinto the Wonder Horse is Dead.'  
But I was reading the newspaper and I was looking for part two of the story  
I had already started -  
so I never read the story, I just saw the headline and kept going.  
A week later I said, 'My God, where's that newspaper?' I started askin people
- I figured he was the horse that belonged to some cowboy movie star, but
nobody had a horse named Pinto. So I just made him up, made him into a
childhood hero.""  
I read it in the paper just about a week ago  
It was on the back page and not many people know  
Boy it made me feel bad when I picked it up and read Pinto the wonder horse is
dead  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together at the Saturday morning picture show  
The dusty trails're gone now but it hurts to hear it said  
Pinto the wonder horse is dead  
My memory goes back to when I was a little kid  
We believed in everything that Pinto ever did  
Will our kids have a hero half as brave or half as strong  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together...  
We believed that Pinto was the fastest horse alive  
If he outrun the wind itself we never were surprised  
In my childhood memory full of boys grow into men Pinto the wonder rides again  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together...  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone

You're not allowed to talk about his first wife Joanne  
You're not allowed to talk about his first fiddle player  
Or anybody who ever worked in Elvis's band  
He motions the driver to get him some coffee  
He sits there and sips it his eyes on the floor  
When he's readin' his paper he sometimes looks angry  
He's still tryin' to figure out the Second World War  
He mentions Chicago the Opry and Wheeling  
His awards are all stacked in the box in his barn  
He made millions of dollars with a hoop and a holler  
Now he lives in a trailer on a five acre farm

The man said son that water'll help to keep your cottage cool  
The Welcome Wagon brought me out some sleepin' pills and booze  
I got the mean old subdivision blues  
Somebody came and knocked my fence down just the other day  
Tore up my yard and hauled my lawnmower away  
Shot out my windows with the BB gun  
A buggsy down the street came by and beat up my son  
So I went out and bought myself a big old German dog  
The man behind me saw me and he started raisin' hogs  
A nineteen year old girl next door is sunnin' in the nude  
I got those mean old subdivision blues  
But I bought my house because it was located near a school  
Now a bus comes by and takes my kids to Istambul  
The guy next door just bought his son a brand new saxophone  
The man behind me sued him cause his hogs were leavin' home  
My buddy left his wife now he's livin' in a tent  
A hippie sued me cause I did not have a room to rent

I couldn't even get the Grand Ole Opry on the radio

The man across the valley started clearin' off this land  
The law came out and said that I would have to move my barn  
They said the man next door was gonna subdivide his farm  
They auctioned off my farm to build the state another school

Well other night I dreamed I died and I went right straight to hell  
I don't know what I did but you know you can never tell  
They handed me a key and handed me a little map  
They said you got a place to live we'll show you where it's at  
They took me to a two room brick just on the edge of town  
With thirty thousand other little houses falling down  
A million years to pay it off with payments overdue

A cigarette was dangling from his lips  
He threw the suitcase in the back and as he got inside  
He said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm awful wet.""  
  
I said, ""Where are you headed, kid?"" And he said, ""To Louisville""  
Said he had an uncle there who ran a store  
Said his daddy died three weeks ago and they didn't own the place  
And they said he couldn't live there anymore  
  
He said his education was that he could read and write  
He quit school the time his dad got hurt  
Ain't much goes on in Prestonsburg, and he was seventeen  
And he had to go some place to find some work  
  
He talked about the girl whose father had a lot of money  
He said he'd send and get her if he could  
His daddy taught him all there was about tobacco-farmin'  
And he said he played the banjer pretty good  
  
We stopped to get a sandwich and the waitress brought a menu

He ordered him a hot dog with a lot of table ketchup  
And water seemed to satisfy his thirst

His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled  
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen  
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?  
At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all  
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall  
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought  
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?  
Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb  
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon  
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV  
Frankly said, ""I think you'll be amazed at what you see""  
The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head  
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read  
""An Educated Monkey!"", said the papers 'cross the land  
It was more than weary sociologists could stand  
Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the Carson show  
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go  
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair  
He became a politician welcome everywhere  
His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact  
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact  
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced  
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp  
Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate  
He was nominated by the folks from every state  
Yes, a monkey was the President, though maybe not the first  
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe  
The dream I had last night has been related as it came  
As for interpretation, well, it's really very plain  
Would you rather have a monkey up in Washington, D.C.  
Or have those people making monkeys out of you and me?

And I'll play you some pinball, no you ain't got a chance

For all these palookas, hey you know what I thinks  
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too

Tom Waits,A Sweet Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun,/t/tom+waits/a+sweet+little+bullet+from+a+pretty+blue+gun_20138791.html,"Well it's raining, it's pouring  
You didn't bring a sweater  
Nebraska'll never let you come back home  
  
Now on Hollywood and Vine  
By the Thrifty Mart sign  
Any night I'll be willin' to bet  
  
There's a young girl  
With sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes  
Standin' there just gettin' all wet  
  
Now there's a place off the drag  
Called the Gilbert Hotel  
And there's a couple letters  
Burned out in the sign  
  
And it's better than a bus stop  
They do good business every time it rains  
For little girls with nothing in their jeans  
But pretty blue wishes and sweet little jeans  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
The old man is snoring  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I hear the sirens in the street  
All my dreams are made of chrome  
I have no way to get back home  
I'd rather die before I wake  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
And you could throw my dreams out in the street  
And let the rain make 'em grow  
  
Now the night clerk he got a club foot  
He's heard every hard luck story  
At least a hundred times or more  
  
He says: check out time is 10 am  
And that's just what it means  
Go on up the stairs  
With sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
And Hollywood's just fine  
Swindle a little girl out of her dreams  
Another letter in the sign  
  
Now never trust a scarecrow wearin' shades after dark  
Be careful of that old bow tie he wears  
It takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun  
To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair  
  
No that ain't no cherry bomb  
Fourth of July's all done  
Just some fool playin' that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun

That's why I changed my name  
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here

Like a pebble in my shoe  
As I walk these streets  
And the ghost of your memory  
Baby Its the thistle in the kiss  
Its the burgler that can break a roses neck  
Its the tatooed broken promise  
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve  
And I see you every time I turn my back

They're insisting that our love  
Must have a eulogy  
Why do I save all of this madness  
Here in the nightstand drawer  
There to haunt upon my shoulders  
Baby I know  
Id be luckier to walk around everywhere I go  
With this blind and broken heart  
That sleeps beneath my lapel

To remind me of my cardinal sin  
I can never wash the guilt  
Or get these bloodstains off my handa  
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey

Tom Waits,Hold On,/t/tom+waits/hold+on_20138874.html,"They hung a sign up in our town  
""If you live it up, you won't live it down""  
So she left Monte Rio, son  
Just like a bullet leaves a gun  
With her charcoal eyes and Monroe hips  
She went and took that California trip  
Oh, the moon was gold, her hair like wind  
Said, 'Don't look back, just come on, Jim'  
  
Oh, you got to hold on, hold on  
You gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch  
And a ring made from a spoon  
Everyone's looking for someone to blame  
  
When you share my bed, you share my name  
Well, go ahead and call the cops  
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops  
She said, 'Baby, I still love you'  
Sometimes there's nothin' left to do  
  
Oh, but you got to hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
And take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Well, God bless your crooked little heart  
St. Louis got the best of me  
I miss your broken China voice  
How I wish you were still here with me  
Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down  
Then you burn your mansion to the ground  
Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here  
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world  
  
Oh, you've got to hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Down by the Riverside motel  
It's 10 below and falling  
By a 99 cent store  
She closed her eyes and started swaying  
But it's so hard to dance that way  
When it's cold and there's no music  
Oh, your old hometown's so far away  
But inside your head there's a record that's playing  
  
A song called 'Hold On', hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right there  
You gotta hold on  
  
You gotta hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on

Seen the Kentucky Derby too  
It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources,  
And I'm holding up the lamp-post if you want to know

Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane  
Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats,  
Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew  
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song?  
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows  
So you ask me what I'm doing here holding up the lamp-post,  
Flipping this quarter, trying to make up my mind  
And if it's heads I go to Tennessee, and tails I buy a drink,  
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you

How we follow the path of the hero.  
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun.  
How we rise to the height of our halo.  
  
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,  
Our way into the arms of the savior.  
Fading all the trials and the tribulations,  
None of us have actually been there.  
Not like you.  
  
Ignorant fibbers in the congregation.  
Gather around spewing sympathy.  
Spare me  
None of them can even hold a candle up to you,  
Blinded by choices hypocrites won't see.  
  
But enough about the collective Judas  
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated.  
Your little piece of the divine.  
  
This little light of mine,  
The gift you passed onto me.  
I'll let it shine,  
To guide you safely on your way.  
Your way home.  
  
What are they going to do when the lights go down?  
Without you to guide them all to Zion?  
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun?  
Other than tremble incessantly.  
  
High is the way, but our eyes are upon the ground  
You were the light and the way that they'll only read about.  
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out.  
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough.  
You're going home.  
  
You're the only one who can hold your head up high.  
  
Shake your fist at the gates saying:  
I have come home now.  
Fetch me the spirit.  
The son, and the father.  
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.  
It's time now, my time now.  
Give me my, give me my, wings.  
  
Give me my,  
Give me my wings.  
  
You are the light, a way.  
That they will only read about.  
  
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.  
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.  
You were my witness.  
My eyes, my evidence.  
Judith Marie, unconditional one.  
  
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.  
Difficult to see you in this light.  
Please forgive this bold suggestion  
Should you see your maker's face tonight.  
Look him in the eye  
Look him in the eye, and tell him.  
I never lived a lie, never took a life.  
But surely saved one, hallelujah.  
It's time for you to bring me home.

Your head was almost empty.

You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk,

You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.  
""If God is our Father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin.""  
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?  
You got to your car and tried all the doors.  
They were locked. It was a red car and it was new.  
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.  
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.

Those little people out there were yours too.

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in

Wander in and wandering.  
No one even invited you in.  
But still you stumble in stumbling.  
So suffocate  
Or get out while you can.  
No one told you to come.  
I hope it sucks you down.

Suffered a late snow

And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

Looking for some Indian blood and  
Find a little in you find a little  
In me we may be  
On this road but

Till I  
Almost smacked him  
Seemed right that night and  
I don't know what  
Takes hold  
Out there in the  
Desert cold  
These guys think they must  
Try and just get over on us

All in all was a pretty nice  
Day and I put the hood  
Right back where  
You could taste heaven

Reach through my corridors  
And tempt me to taste of her power

And nightingales who throw their arms up  
When is enough enough?

And my vowels, well, were trusted  
  
First comes the Birch  
Rowan followed by the Ash  
Then through the Alder she forms  
And merges with Willow  
  
The Hawthorne blossoms  
As the Oak guards the door  
She is the hinge on which the year swings  
He courts the lightning flash and her  
  
Summoning the spirits  
Through incantations  
You said the Thunder God seems to have  
And our enemies are the Reed  
But we knew the Furies held the Holly sacred  
  
We were insulated  
In a circle of words we'd drawn  
With wisdom sent from nine Hazels  
A Rowan fire and a Willow rod  
  
At ten comes the vine  
That generates bramble wine  
The constant change of the night sun  
A song in the blood of the white bull  
  
Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
No one had more  
  
Sharper consonants than you, love

From Ivy leaves is an ale that can unveil  
The hidden meanings and serpents  
Only revealed through visions  
Yes vowels could insert  
""A"" was for the Silver Fir  
  
The Firs of course  
Then came next  
With Heather at her most  
Passionate  
  
The White Poplar's gift to the souls of the dead  
A promise that it was not the end  
But for the vine the ""U"", its coffer  
  
Vowels and consonants  
The power of trees  
The power they hold  
The power of prose  
  
So when the church  
Began to twist the old myths  
They built their own Tower of Babel  
From Ulster to Munster  
  
The Reed gave way then  
To the Elder  
The Earth turns her will

From dawn to dawn  
From Winter to Winter  
At day the Ash had power over the Alder

Back into a party going on that night  
It was the gory of the 80s with karma drawn up in lines  
And two Bugle Boy models saying ""baby it's a freebie  
You sure look deprived."" I had the  
Story of O in my bucket seat  
Of my want to be mustang  
Auditioning for reptiles in their  
Raquel Welsh campaign  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
""I'm not afraid to die"" I said  
I don't find that remotely funny, even  
On this space cake high  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Silicone party babies to the left  
And Joan of Arcs to the right  
No one feeling insecure  
We were all gorge and famous in our last lives  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
""the end is nothing to fear"" I said  
Blow the end  
Now baby who do I gotta shag to get outta here  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Sure you're out there orbiting around  
Wish I had you back now  
I met a drag king called venus  
She had a velvet hologram she said  
""My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am""  
In the glories of the 80's

I'll clone myself like that blonde chick  
That sings Bette Davis eyes and then  
When it all seemed to clear

Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need  
On Martha's foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said-  
The part about that  
""Love taking over your life""  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
""Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you""  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done  
  
""Memories that we have yet"" you said  
""To make like our Burning Bed...""  
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe  
On Martha's foolish ginger.

Toto,Hydra,/t/toto/hydra_20139699.html,"There was a man  
He walked around  
Searching for the girl who had just caught his eye  
""I was a fool!"" he cried  
His mind had wandered  
He blinked and the sky moved e'er so slightly  
He searched the city and she was nowhere to be found  
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you want your freedom  
Do you want my love  
Do you want your freedom  
From the one you're thinking of  
  
There lies a lady  
Naked and yet not knowing  
A spell, it gains her heart forever  
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square  
Fell into an abyss of dead air  
Innocence caged in sanctuary  
There sat the Dragon Lord  
Playing solitary  
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly a voice was heard  
Ina a flash the brave young man appeared  
The Dragon will cut him with his tail  
Chased him to the stairway  
Caught him halfway to the top  
Sent him whirling down  
Fireball, summer solstice  
Dragon Lord descended down on him  
She turned to look but saw only darkness, silence

And the tall green grass

How all this has come to pass  
  
How we've come to surround ourselves  
In a sea of thieves  
In a land without learning  
Only the fools believe  
  
I went driving last night  
On a dark canyon road  
Had the sky to myself  
But I wasn't alone  
  
Had the pain of my lifetime  
For my company  
How did it end up like this  
For you and me  
  
When love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
I will remember you  
  
As I open my eyes to one more day  
The wind burns my face  
As it whispers your name  
As it's pulling me forward  
  
It tears me free  
And the only thing left  
Is the tears for you and me  
  
'Cause when love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone

No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all

I'm hitching a ride for a chance at the good life  
I'll have my own place, out on fifth avenue  
I'm leavin' this time gonna walk on that fine line  
I'll be the first one who finally breaks through  
  
One road to the promised land  
I have to get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Gonna find out just who I am  
  
Freedom, do you know what I mean  
Flatlands, are all I've ever seen  
  
Stuck in a small town where you live, then you die  
Ain't nothin' but fool's workin' nine until five  
I'll sleep in the subways till I get what I need  
I'm not gonna stay here, just lie here and bleed  
  
One road to the promised land  
I'm gonna get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Show the world just who I am  
  
One road to the promised land

One road to the promised land  
Guess I found out, just who I am

Wanna climb up a mountain, find a tree of wisdom

And maybe someday I could be a teacher  
I want that karma when you touch my hand  
I'll walk through the streets,  
Talking to the homeless in winter

He rode for days and nights across the sand  
And one day, he came upon an angel

Went through the back door and pulled out his gold companion

And address them with his cries  
  
I don't even know what's right  
I can say  
That you put up some kind of fight  
I've been branded  
I've been stranded  
I'm so thankful for what I've been handed  
I wish I could say that you're mine  
Such a card game

Townes Van Zandt,At My Window,/t/townes+van+zandt/at+my+window_20139860.html,"At my window  
Watching the sun go  
Hoping the stars know  
It's time to shine  
Daydreams  
Aloft on dark wings  
Soft as the sun streams  
At days decline  
  
Living is laughing  
Dying says nothing at all  
Baby and I are laying here  
Watching the evening fall  
  
Time flows  
Through brave beginnings  
And she leaves her endings  
Beneath our feet  
Walk lightly  
Upon their faces  
Leave gentle traces  
Upon their sleep  
  
Living is dancing  
Dying does nothing at all  
Baby and I are laying here  
Watching the evening fall  
  
Three dimes  
Hard luck and good times  
Fast lines and low rhymes  
Ain't much to say  
Feel fine  
Feel low and lazy  
Feel grey and hazy  
Feel far away  
  
Living is sighing  
Dying ain't flying so high  
Baby and I are lying here  
Watching the day go by

But who cares what the night watchmen say  
The stage has been set for the play  
Hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
  
The moon's come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky  
The wind's runnin' free but it ain't up to me ask why

They've left me with nothin' to say

Hills of golden

That turnin' round

And the gold's no good for spending  
And the poison's hungry waiting

My legs know how to love someone  
My voice knows how to sound.

Some turned away, not to look back again  
  
One stood among them, I remember most clearly  
Her sorrows were heavy, and her laughter was slow  
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly  
And I came her majestic reflections to know  
  
Her words, like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty  
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawl  
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly  
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all  
  
Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind  
Slashing and slicing to take him his toll  
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting  
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul  
  
No longer gypsy-like sadness unending  
Her eyes - they lie hollow and her face petrified  
Some will go laughing and others condemning  
But who there among you could have told her goodbye?

His queen smiled low and blissfully

Plain it was she did agree  
  
He send his deuce down into diamond  
His four to hart, and his trey to spade  
Three kings with their legions come  
Preparations soon where made  
They voted club the days commander  
Gave him an army face and number  
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds  
And the aces in the sky  
  
He give his sevens first instructions  
Spirit me a game of stud  
Stakes unscarred by limitation  
'Tween a man named Gold and man named Mud  
Club filled Gold with greedy vapors  
'Til his long, green eyes did glow  
Mud was left with the sighs and trembles  
Watching his hard earned money go  
  
Flushes fell on Gold like water  
Tens they paired and paired again  
But the aces only flew through heaven  
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Began to think of her long lost son  
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy  
Prayed to the angels every one  
  
The diamond queen, she prayed and prayed  
And the diamond angel filled Muds hole  
The wicked king of clubs himself  
Fell in face down in front of Gold

But the angels from the sky did ride  
Three kings up on the streets of Gold  
Three fireballs on the muddy side

But Lord that queen of diamond's joy  
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall  
Turned out to be a wandering boy  
Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all  
And Mud he raised and Gold did call  
And the smile just melted off his face  
When Mud turned over that diamond ace

If you feel like lost, you'll end up found

You weren't your mama's only boy,  
But her favorite one it seems  
She began to cry when you said goodbye,  
And sank into your dreams.  
  
Pancho was a bandit boy,  
His horse was fast as polished steel  
He wore his gun outside his pants  
For all the honest world to feel.  
Pancho met his match you know  
On the deserts down in Mexico  
Nobody heard his dying words,  
Ah but that's the way it goes.  
  
All the Federales say  
They could have had him any day  
They only let him slip away  
Out of kindness, I suppose.  
  
Lefty, he can't sing the blues  
All night long like he used to.  
The dust that Pancho bit down south  
Ended up in Lefty's mouth  
The day they laid poor Pancho low,  
Lefty split for Ohio  
Where he got the bread to go,  
There ain't nobody knows  
  
The poets tell how Pancho fell,  
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels  
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,

You look at me now, and don't think I don't know  
What all your eyes are a sayin'  
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies  
They're just tricks that his brains been a playin'?  
A lover of women he can't hardly stand  
He trembles he's bent and he's broken  
I've fallen it's true but I say unto you  
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken  
  
I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known  
I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven  
But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and  
Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding  
I buried my face but it spoke once again  
The night to the day we're a bindin'  
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin  
And even the moonlight is blinding

and your crippled young gypsy, he's grown tall and strong

when your magazine memory has spun you around  
and you realize your lovers were just painted clowns  
and outside your window you start hearing sounds  
where they're building a cross for to burn you  
  
when all your bright scarlet turn slowly to blue  
will you stop and decide that it's over?  
  
When your teardrops go sour and no longer fall  
the splash cross the virgin that lives down your hall  
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall  
well then, what will you have you can offer?  
When the firedancers finish and leave you alone  
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone  
that hang round your neck, slicing through to the bone  
will there still be place for your laughter?  
  
As your shattered illusions come a-tumblin' home  
and all of the butchers you've nourished have grown  
and they are suddenly able to leave you alone  
and they run like slaves that are set free  
when your questions are answered and your pleading is done  
and your mind starts to screaming that you ain't the one  
that once dwelled within you, will you turn, will you run  
Then princess, will you come home and get me?

Like the sanitarium blues  
  
Then upon some sunlit day  
They figure there's no need for you to stay  
They're pretty sure you can't be cured  
So they send you on your merry way

Caress your bosom fair

Do you think it matters?  
  
What do your feelin's mean?  
Do you think I'd love more

Would your words be sweeter then  
Upon November's wind

Could your smile be softer?  
Would your eyes more brightly shine?  
Would your laughter be so tender

With hands made of heaven  
Reflections sent spinnin'  
Through a face laced in mist  
Now I stand where she left me  
Buried deep 'neath her shadow  
And the mirror plead sadly  
Does it all come to this  
And I wonder: Will she call my name?  
  
The wind careens madly  
Through wide windows paneless  
Fragrancies mingle  
In a room full of shade  
The peons pick partners  
And waltz cross the ceilings  
But the violins whisper  
That I've been betrayed  
Tryin not to look ashamed  
  
The drunkards drink deeply  
From cups full of nothingness  
Ghost lovers laugh  
At the games that they play  
The moments do somersaults  
Into eternity  
Cling to their coattails  
And beg them to stay  
Saying I got nothing to hide  
  
Illusions projected  
On walls made of Tiffany  
Mad minuets to  
A sad satin song  
A harlequin mandolins  
Harmonize helplessly  
Hoping that endlessly  
Won't last for long  
Praying that their God ain't dying  
  
Then I turn and I see her  
In a dress made of moonlight  
Teardrops like diamonds  
Run slow down her face  
Her arms surround me  
Like chains made of velvet  
And the demons fall faithfully  
Into their place  
And the rivers run with jewels  
  
Now the morning lies open  
The night went quite quickly  
Memory harmlessly  
Fractures and fades  
All the poets do push-ups  
On carpets of rubber foam  
Loudly they laugh  
At some joke that's been made  
And the wise men speak like fools

And dead men lay deep 'round the door

So mother, think on me no more

And the cold of a thousand snows  
Lay heaped upon the forests leaf  
But she dressed in calico

Fancy she would be  
And the fire of her longing would keep way the cold  
And her dress was a sight to see  
But the road was long beneath the feet  
She followed her frozen breath  
In search of a certain St John the gambler  
Stumbling to her death  
She heard his laughter right down from the mountains  
And danced with her mothers tears  
To a funeral drawn a calico  
'neath the cross of twenty years

The deeds that rang our youthful dreams  
It seems shall go undone  
North for the shores of Valinor  
Our bows and crimson sails were made  
Our captains were strong, our lances long  
And our liege the holy king  
  
The hills did turn from green to blue  
And vanish as on the decks we watched  
But every thought in that noble company  
Was forward bound  
To the lifeless plains of Valinor  
Where reigns the dark and frozen one  
And with tongues afire and glorious eyes  
We pledged our mission be  
  
The clime from mild to bitter ran  
The wind from fair to fierce did blow  
Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts  
Of homes left far behind  
Longed every man for some glimpse of land  
And the host that did await us there  
But each new day brought only a sea  
And sky of ice and gray  
  
Thanks give no word can drag you through  
Those endless weeks our ships did roll  
Thanks give you cannot see those sails  
And faces bleach and draw  
Ice we drank and leather did chew  
For the oceans are unwholesome there  
The dead that slid into the seas  
Did freeze before our eyes  
  
Then a wind did fling the ships apart  
Each one to go her separate way  
The sky did howl, the hull did groan  
For how long I do not know  
And what men were left when the winds had ceased  
Grew dull and low of countenance  
For soldiers denied their battle plain  
On comrades soon must turn  
  
So one by one we died alone  
Some by hunger, some by steel  
Bodies froze where they did fall  
Their souls unsanctified  
Until only another and I were left  
Then just before his flame did fail  
We shone ourselves brothers-in-arms  
To serve the holy king  
  
Perhaps this shall reach Andilar  
Although I know not how it can  
For once again he's hurled his wind  
Upon the silver prow  
But if it should my words are these  
Arise young men fine ships to build  
And set them north for Valinor  
'neath standards proud as fire

I'd take it all take it all I'd run away  
Me for myself first class and first rate  
But all that you have is your soul  
  
Here I am waiting for a better day  
A second chance  
A little luck to come my way  
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again  
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have

This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
But I'm too old to go chasing you around  
Wasting my precious energy  
  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Because I don't want leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why I should stay  
Said I told you that I loved you  
And there ain't no more to say

Tracy Chapman,Going Back,/t/tracy+chapman/going+back_20463748.html,"No picnic no barbecue out in the back  
A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget  
For chained-up mad dogs for garbage to sit  
Get lost get lost a part from it  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't see through it  
But i can see past  
With me with me always  
Without going back  
  
Just people and buildings  
Not city or town  
Great lake crooked river  
Flat land water burns  
The air not smoke  
It tears the eye  
Home is where you live  
Home is where you'll die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a glacial slide  
Over ice mirrored glass  
In a slip and past times  
Are in the future brought back  
Reflected reflected reflected  
Every footstep  
  
No walk in the park  
No there is nowhere  
No place can replace  
What a clear eye reveals  
Soft and hard shaped like a wheel  
Made me of rubber made me of steel  
  
[Chorus]

It's all in a day  
One day in a life  
It's all in the one word  
The one word is goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in what you say  
Though you've tried to be kind  
It's all in the words  
From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh  
Goodbye  
  
For you  
It's all in your face  
The laugh and worry lines  
It's all in the one word  
You hope will make you young again  
Goodbye  
  
It's all in the play  
Someone speaks the line  
It's all in the one word  
That stops and steals the time  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in a day  
It's the part in life  
When it's all in the words  
To fate and circumstance resigned  
Goodbye

Look for God and life on distant planets  
Have your faith in the ever after  
While each of us holds inside the map to the labyrinth  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
We are the spirit the collective conscience  
We create the pain and the suffering and the beauty in this world  
Heaven's here on earth  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding  
  
I've seen and met angels wearing the disguise  
Of ordinary people leading ordinary lives  
Filled with love, compassion, forgiveness and sacrifice  
Heaven's in our hearts  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding

Believe in what you see  
The kingdom is at hand  
The promised land is at your feet  
We can and will become what we aspire to be  
If Heaven's here on earth  
  
If we have faith in humankind  
And respect for what is earthly  
And an unfaltering belief that truth is divinity  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
I've seen spirits  
I've met angels  
I've touched creations beautiful and wondrous  
I've been places where I question all I think I know  
But I believe, I believe, I believe this could be heaven  
  
We are born inside the gates with the power to create life  
And to take it away  
The world is our temple  
The world is our church

Lived my twenties in haze  
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars  
With the A-list of B-list movie stars  
  
When they come to arrest me  
Pat me down and undress me  
I'll confess without miranda  
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras

To the last line of the final chapter

Seduced my share in silk and polyester  
Oh my great loves  
And my few losses  
I'll tell it all  
When my little black book is published  
  
When they come to interview me

Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard  
Who did it all for the love and laughter

Had my trust in god  
Worked everyday of my life  
Thought I had some guarantees  
That's what I thought  
At least that's what I thought  
  
Last night I had another restless sleep  
Wondering what tomorrow might bring  
Last night I dreamed

I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe  
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light  
If I'd lived right  
  
But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar  
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow  
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion  
The love I can't disavow  
  
If this is a dream wake me up now  
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out  
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life  
If I'd lived right  
  
Some would call me a cheat call me a liar  
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desired  
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices  
But I tried to live right  
  
But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart  
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused  
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all  
If I'd lived right  
  
Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?  
Do you care what is thought by others about you?  
If this day is all that is promised to you  
Do you life for the future the present the past?  
  
If there is one thing I know I know I will die  
If anyone cares some stranger my critique my life  
I may be revered or defamed and decried

And I never saw someone say that before  
You held my hand and we walked home the long way  
You were loosening my grip on Bobby Orr  
  
Isn't it amazing anything's accomplished  
When the little sensation gets in your way  
Not one ambition whisperin' over your shoulder  
Isn't it amazing you can do anything  
  
We hung out together every single moment  
Cause that's what we though married people do  
Complete with the grip of artificial chaos  
And believing in the country of me and you  
Crisis of faith and crisis in the Kremlin  
And yea we'd heard all of that before  
It's wintertime, the house is solitude with options  
And loosening the grip on a fake cold war  
  
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish  
When you don't let the nation get in your way  
No ambition whisperin' over your shoulder  
Isn't it amazing you can do anything  
  
Next to your comrades in the national fitness program  
Caught in some eternal flexed-arm hang  
Droppin' to the mat in a fit of laughter  
Showed no patience, tolerance or restraint  
  
Fireworks exploding in the distance  
Temporary towers soar  
Fireworks emulating heaven  
Til there are no stars anymore

Til there are no stars shining up in heaven

I think it was Algonquin Park  
It was so cold and winter-dark  
A promised hibernation high  
Took me across the great black plate of ice.  
  
Now I'm the islander.  
I found a place to call my den  
And dreamt of the ferry and  
The enormous man  
Huge as were his children  
Following around after him  
  
I'm the islander  
Woke up in the furtive spring  
More capable of anything  
  
I waited for more men to come  
Hey docked their boats and cocked their guns  
The time for truth and reconciliation's gone  
But with my belly full I intended to get something done  
  
I'm the islander  
Woke up in the dead of spring  
More hungry than anything  
Islander

We're rolling, so what?  
Never getting older where the moonshocked curtains part.

A teardrop, then a Vaccination scar.

Random like a bad cartoon, like  
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge,

Swimming on a bit,  
'Stop, you're treading water' as the sun assimilated the words.  
For lighthouse fire  
Burning down to embers end.  
The mysteries met  
Sky just reddened  
Headin' home under dusk.  
Is life just forgettin' another word for frivolous?  
Little silver boulder, silence from Mars.  
For the heart of enough  
Or a teardrop, then a Vaccination Scar.  
  
Wherever you are,  
Scar

Train,Landmine,/t/train/landmine_10235587.html,"Well there ain't much entertainment  
In a town this size at all  
So I've got myself up, dressed for this arraignment  
Cause I don't think I'm ready for the fall  
  
Now I find my thoughts deep in this room all by myself  
Thinking the moon might just explode if I don't leave  
And the more I wait  
It seems the more I hate  
This town for what it's doing to me  
This is when I need you most of all  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know you  
Between the lines  
  
I dropped down to about one foot two  
Hoping to get more looks for you  
But it never made much difference in your eyes  
And I suppose that I couldn't help things much  
To set this day in a whirlwind rush  
After finding out the backseat changed our lives  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know you  
Between the lines  
Between the lines  
  
It's 5am and if I run  
I am sure to pay for what I've done  
And if I say I'm sure I wish I ran  
And though I knew this day would come  
I never thought that I would run  
For someone who was blind to me  
You're as blind to me as you could be  
  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Yeah  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know myself  
Between the lines  
Between the lines

Train,Meet Virginia,/t/train/meet+virginia_20140427.html,"She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess  
If you catch her stealin', she won't confess  
She's beautiful, she smokes a pack a day, wait that's me, but anyway  
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey  
She thinks I'm beautiful. Meet Virginia  
  
She never compromises, loves babies and surprises  
Wears hi-heels when she exercises  
Ain't that beautiful  
Meet Virginia  
  
Well she wants to be the Queen  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I don't really wanna be the queen  
  
Her daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors  
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President  
Well here she is again on the phone  
Just like me hates to be alone  
We just like to sit at home, and rip on the President  
  
Meet Virginia  
Well she wants to live her life  
Then she thinks about her life  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I don't really wanna live this life  
  
She only drinks coffee at midnight, when the moment is not  
Right, her timing is quite unusual  
You see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic  
And the shape of her body unusual  
  
Meet Virgina I can't wait to  
Meet Virginia, yeah e yeah hey hey hey  
  
Well she wants to be the queen and  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Well she wants to live her life

Pulls her hair back as she screams

I, I don't really wanna be the queen  
I, I don't really wanna be the queen  
I, I don't really wanna live this

Train,Mermaid,/t/train/mermaid_21018370.html,"Whoa, whoa  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
Stayed there 'till the air was clear  
I was bored and out of tears, then I saw you washed up on the shore  
I offered you my coat, thank godess love can float  
Crazy how that shipwreck met my ship was comin' in  
We talked 'till the sun went down  
Love on the Pugit Sound  
My treasure map was on your skin  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
'Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Shocks, screams with envy they wonder what you see in me  
Funny thoughts sometimes can't help but wonder that as well  
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid  
The way to this heavenly bay, it went through hell  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Rescued you by the Banu tree, all the girl fish in the sea  
Puttin' a candle to you, they don't have a handle on you, they don't have a
scandal on you  
Holler back will save you  
Saving me was B-I-G, all the boy fish in the sea  
They all wish that they could be me  
  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach

Spends her light on the Bayou  
But she don't come to see  
She's the one that makes my dreams  
They call her Mississippi

The shape of her horizon  
Makes the morning sun  
When she puts her eyes on  
Each and anyone  
She's the one that makes me fall  
Midnight moon shines through it all

I ain't no new sensation, no, no  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
Take a look at my situation  
Tearing it down just to start it up  
I ain't no new sensation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
Used to spend time trying to chase it  
Now I spend time trying to erase it  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now take a look at this reputation  
It's not what it is but what it's not  
It ain't some new sensation  
But it keeps getting better and better and  
Used to spend time thinking there's a reason  
Now I spend time knowing I'm in season  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
And I've been running away from you for way too long  
And all my trying, all your lying, all of your crying,  
I kept buying it  
I've waited too long
