Kylie Minogue,If You Don't Love Me,/k/kylie+minogue/if+you+dont+love+me_20081002.html,"You can tell me anything  
You can tell me anything  
I'll believe you  
  
You know it too  
Share the truth with lies  
Set aside one flies  
Will you realise  
  
[Chorus]  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
I will know  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
  
You can ask me anything  
You can ask me anything  
I will do it  
  
You know it too  
Nothing that I'll do  
If you want me to  
And it's all so true

Kylie Minogue,If You Were With Me Now,/k/kylie+minogue/if+you+were+with+me+now_20080954.html,"Without you standing by my side  
Love and good fortune passes me by  
And you were my guiding light  
It seemed so easy  
When we said goodbye  
  
How different would the world be now  
If only we had worked it out somehow  
What kind of fools are you and I  
There would be stars up in the sky  
If you were with me now  
  
And I know I may go astray  
But who's to say that we can't change our mind  
My love burns stronger each day  
If I'm sure of one thing  
  
One love at a time  
How could we throw our love away  
When we had so much more than words can say  
The darkest clouds would fade away  
To bring the light into my day  
If you were with me now  
  
If loving you is right  
Then turn back the hands of time  
I'd do anything to make you mine  
There'snothing that I wouldn't do  
I could make you feel my love for you  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now

But i don't believe it's true that  
I'm not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong for us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
[Chorus]  
I hope you find someone  
Who can love you like i do  
I'll be strong inside  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
Since the day that i found you  
I built my dreams all around you and i  
Believed you would never leave me  
So sure it was love forever more  
But if you walk out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say the magic has gone forever  
But deep down inside i don't believe it's so  
But i'm letting you go

Kylie Minogue,Illusion,/k/kylie+minogue/illusion_20456759.html,"A situation's taken over me  
Can't you see  
I'm in trouble?  
Infatuation's got a hold on me  
A little jealously  
I'm not myself at all  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
You serenade me at the ball  
Hiding from it all  
Behind a disguise  
Who's the man who's at the masquerade?  
Wish I hadn't stayed  
Just to drown in lies  
  
Like the headline of a magazine, are you what you seem  
Because I'm losing my belief?  
Can I make it when there's so much doubt  
Someone, help me out 'cause I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
Follow my dreams into distant lands  
Blowing in the winds over shifting sands  
  
I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
I'm so lost in this illusion

No need to save my seat  
'Cause I'm not gonna miss a beat  
I wanna freak it  
Your conversation's fine  
But save it for some other time  
Right now I'm dancing (like a dancin' machine)  
Get with my bangin' beat

A little taste of moonlight  
And a canopy of stars

Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
You're the reason I'm so high  
  
Ever had the feeling  
Something couldn't be more right  
I feel as if I know you  
And we only met tonight  
I've got a cool sensation  
I can hardly catch my breath

I don't want tonight to end  
We could be starting something  
You feel more than a friend  
The universe conspired  
For the two of us tonight

In denial  
No, my life's a trial  
I'm not denying that every little bit hurts  
It's a problem, that I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while,  
Getting away before it gets any worse today  
  
Kylie:  
Your in denial, and that is final  
Your not admitting, you should be quitting  
All these queens and fairies, and muscle Mary's  
The rough trade boyfriend, who in his pathetic own way denies he gay  
Why can't he see this is a fantasy

I think I'm going mad  
How'd you know if your going mad?  
  
Kylie:  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Neil:  
Look at me I'm sad  
I'm not denying, I could be trying, a little harder to deal with some of this
stuff  
  
Kylie:  
Know what I'm thinking, less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes, and you'll feel a little less worth  
  
Neil:  
Is that enough? My life is absurd  
I'm living it upside down  
Like a vampire working at night, Sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows he's gay  
  
Both:  
Can you love me anyway?

If only they'd come true  
  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
  
You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying  
Won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time  
Till I can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect  
To get a guarantee  
It's just that I believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share  
Of hearts broken  
And I don't wanna take that anymore  
  
All aboard!

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.

In my some kind of bliss  
  
Study my reflection  
And let the colors fall  
Slip into stillness  
And be above it all  
  
Good to be here  
Time to be alone  
I've found a space where I belong  
Not succumb to fear  
  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss

I always thought it was you,  
You always thought it was me.  
We always thought we were it,  
Seemed like a real perfect fit,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
I always thought even though,  
We were so young we could grow.  
Up in the end it'd be us,  
We'd take the F or the bus,  
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I miss our cheap chandalier  
'Member when dad hung it there?  
And we would watch Rocky IV,  
The one where the Russian scored,  
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.  
  
I'd call you my champion  
Thought we had already won  
And cracked open our last beer,  
Falling asleep in our tears,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.

Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death

Brooklyn Nights happy.

I found an old pair of  
Keys in my purse that opened  
The walkup we shared  
How did they get there, jerk?  
I wanna see you there  
I wanna make it work.  
  
I didn't brush my hair  
And my lashes are falling  
Off of seven years  
Of our bad luck dating.  
I want one last night there,  
A Brooklyn Night affair.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death

Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Outro]  
Its not that I don't want to love you  
Cause I really tried, and I  
Just wanna hang with the old you  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.  
  
Have a drink with your former self  
We both won't act like someone else  
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu

I was taught to fight, taught to win  
I never thought I could fail  
  
No fight left or so it seems  
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted  
I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have fans  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good  
  
Though I saw it all around  
Never thought I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be the last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home  
The place that I was born, on the lakeside  
As daylight broke, I saw the earth  
The trees had burned down to the ground  
  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up  
We don't need much of anything  
Don't give up  
'Cause somewhere there's a place  
Where we belong  
  
Rest your head  
You worry too much  
It's going to be alright  
When times get rough  
You can fall back on us  
Don't give up  
Please don't give up  
  
'Got to walk out of here  
I can't take anymore  
Going to stand on that bridge  
Keep my eyes down below  
Whatever may come  
And whatever may go

Tried hard to settle down

So many men no-one needs

I said, ""Honey, it's simple.  
It's the way that you love and treat your mother""

But I won't be tonight  
I'm a man without a home

And you'll be my little gypsy princess  
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset  
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets

Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels

I know it's easier said then done  
I keep pretending that I've moved on  
And after all these lies,  
I keep telling myself  
Help me from falling,  
I'm broken, not perfect and it hurts  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
Now this is klling us  
  
Day by day, I would run away  
The clock ticks, but doesn't change  
Are we living?  
Or just existing?  
Afraid to face our fears  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect

Pretty will be the photograph I leave  
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees

Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself  
Maybe I'll just clean the shit of these fancy shoes  
I'll be a princess di and die with you

I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart  
I've been trying to tell you how I feel  
But was never very smart  
I'm wrapped in silks made for egyptian queens  
I'll do it in the swimming pool

Bleach out all the dark

Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold  
With the paparazzi all swarming around  
In my louis vuiton white buttoned down  
Oh it's not that deep  
So bob your head for another dead blonde  
Who's real prince is in heaven  
She just wants to sleep  
  
The final act of life will be my own hands to do,

Put on a pretty little number  
I'm wearing you still  
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast  
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me  
He has a funny way saying forever too fast  
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp  
For something he don't have  
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
It's the only one I know  
It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

Got a baby sister who looks just like me  
She wants nothing more than a man to please  
Maybe she's in too deep  
Her love for him ain't cheap  
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece  
From Fulton Street  
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants  
He's thirsty when he drinks  
Gets on the brink, and throws her off  
I get on my knees and beg you

Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets that I used to own  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh,

I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh  
  
It was the wicked and a wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I've become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my blonde head on a silver plate  
Just a Gaga on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be queen?  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason that I can't explain  
I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he won't call my name  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Now I'm doing my very best not to mess up all the words but,  
A strong apology to Coldplay, but I think otherwise it's a good job  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh,  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
The Fame won't change us if we don't let it  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Mary won't call my name  
Never an h-honest word

As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kiddies knock him down  
  
When it snows  
Ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

Of broken dreams, and city queens

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me  
Gold and made of flowers dangling  
And I almost cried as I sold them all  
I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no  
But I gotta get to and from where I come  
And it's gonna take money to go  
Oh no, oh oh, oh oh...  
  
In the name of higher consciousness  
I let the best man I knew go  
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved  
But it's better to know all you can know  
I said it's nice to love and be loved  
But I'd rather know what God knows  
Oh no, oh no, oh no...  
  
I can do this once more  
No man can keep me together

Lana Del Rey,This Is What Makes Us Girls,/l/lana+del+rey/this+is+what+makes+us+girls_20995957.html,"Remember how we used to party up all night  
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life  
Drinking in the small town firelight  
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Walking down the street as they whistle, ""Hi, hi!""  
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys  
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive  
  
There she was my new best friend  
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind  
While she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes:  
""Lana, how I hate those guys.""  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
And that's where the beginning of the end begun  
Everybody knew that we had too much fun  
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job  
(With the boss)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive  
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight  
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night  
  
Know we used to go break in  
to the hotel pool, glittering we'd swim  
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops  
screaming, ""Get us while we're hot""  
""We don't give a whaaat!""  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first

This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen  
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean  
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens  
And you know something?  
  
They were the only friends I ever had  
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad  
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform  
Crying 'cause I know I'm never comin' back.  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse

This is what makes us girls  
Darlin' little queens do you know what you're worth?  
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl  
It's all gonna happen

This is why we rule the world now, baby.

That he's ever seen

If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for  
If He won't help me do it?  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me

I can tell that you're the type  
To never trust a beauty queen  
But I was never voted for nothing and,  
Highschool never meant anything to anybody  
Never ever gave myself away  
But even when I'm funny  
You think I'm acting so I say  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
You say that you don't want to be hypnotized  
But baby, I, I don't wanna hypnotize you  
There's nothing from you that I wanna take  
I just wanna be like you  
Maybe love you just a little bit  
Please  
  
Tell 'em mom and daddy gave themselves,  
I won't to you  
You told me to get my ways as I do what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna strike out, right now  
I'm striking out right now with this song  
But I can't help myself  
I can't do right for long  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a Wlan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me

put the record out, people would Misunderstand what I meant by ""Rebel"" and  
they just take it to the streets...  
  
[One and only verse]  
  
Ok, yeah, alright...  
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright  
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright  
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses  
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences  
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted  
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it  
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man  
Cuz like the Bible says, His blood is on their hands  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say, is rebel  
While today is still today, choose well  
And what I gotta say, is rebel, it can't go down this way  
Choose well, choose well, choose well...  
...choose well, choose well, choose well  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
Your lives are so incomplete, and nothing, and no one, can replace it

And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say

Is rebel... rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel  
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel  
Repent, the day is far too spent, rebel... rebel!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up...  
Wake up and rebel  
We must destroy in order to rebuild  
Wake up, you might as well  
Oh are you... oh are you satisfied

Now I don't  
Now I don't  
  
As I look at what I've done  
The type of life that I've lived  
How many things I pray the father will forgive  
One situation involved a young man  
He was the ocean and I was the sand  
He stole my heart like a thief in the night  
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight  
  
1 - I used to love him but now I don't  
I used to love him but now I don't  
  
I chose the road of passion and pain  
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain  
Gave up my power ceased being queen  
Addicted to love yeah, like the drug of  
Drug of a fiend  
  
Torn and confused wasted and used  
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose  
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated  
For something to happen that just wasn't fated  
Thought what I wanted was something I needed  
When mamma said no then I just should have heeded  
Misled I bled till the poison was gone  
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Father you saved me and showed me that life  
Was much more than being some foolish mans wife  
Showed me that love was respect and devotion  
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans  
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished  
Content because that part of my life is finished, oh yeah  
  
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye  
Is one of a man whose lost treasures untold  
But my heart is gold, see I took back my soul  
And totally let my creator control  
The life which was his to begin with  
  
Repeat 1 until fade

When I was bound, yes, you set me free  
Things that you do makes it clear to see  
It's all a master plan  
Oh, no greater love that I've come to know  
And when I refuse, you still love me so  
With open arms you came and rescued me  
And erased all the pain

Miscommunication leads to complication  
My emancipation don't fit your equation  
I was on the humble, you on every station  
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb  
But remember not a game new under the sun  
Everything you did has already been done  
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston  
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run  
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent  
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun  
Can't take a threat to mi new born son  
L's been this way since creation  
A groupie call, you fall from temptation  
Now you want to ball over separation  
Tarnish my image in your conversation  
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
Now, now how come your talk turn cold?  
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul  
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control  
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold  
Wisdom is better than silver and gold  
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful  
Every man want to act like he's exempt  
Need to get down on his knees and repent  
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment  
Your movement's similar to a serpent  
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?  
Consequence is no coincidence  
Hypocrites always want to play innocent  
Always want to take it to the full out extent  
Always want to make it seem like good intent  
Never want to face it when it time for punishment  
I know you don't want to hear my opinion  
But there come many paths and you must choose one  
And if you don't change then the rain soon come  
See you might win some, but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done? it's so silly how come?  
You just lost one  
  
Now don't you understand man universal law?  
What you throw out comes back to you, star  
Never underestimate those who you scar  
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!  
You can't hold god's people back that long  
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong  
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond  
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong  
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song  
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone  
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn  
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn  
Now, some might listen and some might shun  
And some may think that they've reached perfection  
If you look closely you'll see what you've become  
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

Too afraid to contradict  
The expectations of the system  
Oh and the harsh reality  
Is they've made Grace for you and me  
Instead of saving you and me  
They're just enslaving you and me!

These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
  
Know what I mean?

Lauryn Hill,Sweetest Thing,/l/lauryn+hill/sweetest+thing_20349736.html,"The sweetest thing I've ever known  
Was like the kiss on the collarbone  
Soft caress of happiness  
The way you walk your style of dress  
I wish I didn't get so weak  
Ooo baby just to hear you speak  
Makes me argue just to see  
How much you're in love with me  
See like a queen a queen upon her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
  
I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)  
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay  
Warm as the sun dipped in black  
Fingertips on the small of my back  
More valuable than all I own  
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was the, ah  
I tried to explain  
Ah, but baby, it's in vain  
  
Speaking on my mother's phone  
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)  
Sweet prince of the ghetto  
Your kisses taste like amaretto  
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating  
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end  
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

But sometimes love just can't erase  
What's written in the stars  
So before the bitter words come crashing down  
Let's leave what's left, and the lights go out  
  
And fade to blue

There won't be a curtain call  
Just fade to blue

Once the feelings starts to fade to blue

We won't always see eye to eye  
We say hurtful things, sometimes

And how we melted in our seats  
There will never be a January  
As warm in Tennessee  
It was an angel in the night  
Nothing's ever felt so right  
And even the stars over our backyard  
Don't shine sometimes

Highs and lows, it's alright

But its harder to be friends  
Baby pull down the covers  
Its time you let me in  
Maybe light a couple candles  
Ill just go ahead and lock the door  
If you just talk to me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Lay your head on my pillow  
I sit beside you on the bed  
Dont you think its time we say  
Some things we havent said  
It aint too late to get back to that place  
Back to where, we thought it was before  
Why dont you look at me  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Sometimes its hard to love me  
Sometimes its hard to love you too  
I know its hard believing  
That love can pull us through  
It would be so easy  
To live your life  
  
With one foot out the door  
Just hold me baby

Just keeping score  
So lets get down to it baby  
There aint no need to lie  
  
Tell me who you think you see  
When you look into my eyes  
Lets put our two hearts back together  
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor  
Make love with me baby

From the moment she was born  
She was always perfect  
Whole town said, "" Why can't you be more like her?""  
  
Lights go on and she's ready to spin  
On stage doing all the things she's told to  
Puts on a show in front of the whole damn world  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause that sweet little angel is not the girl I know  
  
[Chorus]  
She gets wound up  
She gets higher by the minute  
Turns the sound up  
To drown out all the pain  
They all think they know her  
But no one really knows  
That she goes a little crazy sometimes  
  
She parks her car at the top of the hill  
Only inches from the edge  
Where she's almost falling  
Stares at the sky till she's drowning in the rain  
  
Nice dress, nice smile  
What a wonderful child  
If they knew all the lies she's told them  
It's too complicated for her to explain  
  
She prays to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go

Leann Rimes,Written In The Stars,/l/leann+rimes/written+in+the+stars_10163411.html,"I am here to tell you we can never meet again  
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then  
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when  
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell  
The someone you once loved so long ago so well  
  
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by  
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply  
Every moment of my life from now until I die  
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand  
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?  
  
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide  
No escape, no change of heart, no any place to hide  
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied  
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned  
What it is to be in love and have that love returned  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?

Vicious but ready to learn  
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer  
Sometimes but always in vain  
  
So I'll wait until we're sane  
Wait until we're blessed and all the same  
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give

Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way  
  
With great expectations I change all my clothes  
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold  
Screaming above central london  
Never bored, so I'll never get old

All mute no light no sun only light  
As far away as neverland  
  
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head  
And the valleys are all filed up with dirt  
As many people as there are sands in the sea  
Will die the morning after  
  
So little girl with your heroin so blue

Through the battle sequence you must fight  
'Til the morning turns to night

Just follow the son, he'll take you where

You make me shine... with all the love that you give  
And when I think of you... I keep driftin' away  
Little by little... I love you more ever day

I close my eyes and you're all that I see  
I can't believe that it's happening to me

Living in a fantasy  
Drowning in this luxury  
Ever since you came to me  
I'm living in a dream  
  
Oh, I know... there'll be storms up ahead  
We'll blow them away... bring back the sun again  
For love conquers all... the gloom and despair  
Nothin' can go wrong... just as long as you're there  
I see a light on the path up ahead  
I know you'll wait on the cliff where you said  
I'll hold you close 'till we're right on the edge  
  
Living in a fantasy  
Oh you're too much... too soon... too strong  
But I want to drown in your touch

We met somewhere in the back streets  
In this city of another age  
And talking broken English 'til the darkness came  
And in my room she called me by my name  
And she whispered  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light

It disappears in the sunshine  
It's something that they never say

When we made love in that hotel  
Like I never made before  
Thought I could die  
When she whispered slow  
Marai toujours  
She was wild and enchanting  
The night was like a dream  
We danced and sang the  
Sweetest harmony  
The words come back so clear  
I remember when we sang

Paris dies in the morning

The moment when it steals your heart

That's something that he doesn't understand  
Her words were choked and broken  
She left him with a token  
The note he is holding in his hand  
(Don't let me down, don't let me down)  
Is this the end of the game  
And will you put out the flame  
And fly away  
Don't fly away  
Now let's find out who's too blame  
And start all over again  
Don't fly away  
Don't fly away  
Way across the city  
Waiting on a taxi  
Holding cases  
Standing in the hall  
Thinking ""well if only""  
She's feeling sad and lonely  
Hoping 'gainst all hope that he will call  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Is this the end of the game  
And should I put out the flame  
And fly away, and fly away  
And if I walk out again  
Is it true that the pain  
Will fly away, fly away  
Fly away  
The taxi driver's talking  
But she doesn't hear a single word he says  
Fly away,  
The tears fall so easily  
Keep falling 'til she climbs aboard the plane  
And it's the end of the game  
With only fortune to blame  
  
[Solo]  
  
Yes, it's the end of the game  
But love was given in vain  
Sail away, sail away  
Just like the sunshine and rain  
It's true that one day will pain will fly away  
Fly away, fly away

Sitting at the table and my dinner's up  
It's gonna be different when

Gonna save some money  
And quit this job

Through the underpass

Counting the months and the years  
When I lived alone  
  
The days were so bleak  
And the nights were so black and cold  
Walkin' around in the street  
In the pouring rain  
  
Hanging 'round waitin' for love  
But it never came  
Suddenly you were there  
Though I never thought about you  
  
Now that the world has changed  
It's so strange how I found you  
Sharing a secret that no one  
Could understand  
  
Feeling brave in my heart  
Yet too scared to let go of your hand  
Runnin' wild in the streets  
Just the way all the young lovers do  
  
You only livin' for me  
And me only for you  
Suddenly life had changed  
When you said I love you  
  
And though the words were plain  
It's so strange  
You said I love you  
And oh how my life has changed  
  
After searchin' in vain  
I found you  
  
Though the world has changed  
We're still the same - I still love you  
Though the world has changed  
Aah, we're still the same, why'know I love you  
  
One night I thought that you were gone  
What could I do?  
Runnin' around in the pouring rain  
Lookin' for you  
  
Wondering if I'd ever see you again  
Then through the darkness  
I heard you calling my name  
Loving you when you're not there  
  
I'm never lonely anywhere  
Outside the world has changed  
We're the same  
I still love you  
  
And though the world has changed

That's how it's meant to be  
Well I tried all I can just to figure it out  
But love's just mystery  
  
Guess all you ladies would call me easy  
But I'm a fool for the femme fatale  
When she flashes those eyes I'm not a man I'm a mouse  
Tryin' to patch up a broken heart  
  
You win, I lose  
That's okay that's the way it goes  
Well I tried all I could but it did me no good  
'Cause all I've got is nothin' to show  
  
They say that men are always supposed to act  
Like they're not really tryin'  
But when I come on cool nobody seems to notice  
It's a mystery  
It's a mystery to me  
  
You see you win, I lose  
I guess that's how we're meant to be  
I tried as hard as I could but it did me no good  
You're more than a match for me  
And it don't make no sense to me  
Love is still a mystery  
It's just a mystery

Leonard Cohen,A Thousand Kisses Deep,/l/leonard+cohen/a+thousand+kisses+deep_20082865.html,"The ponies run, the girls are young,  
The odds are there to beat.  
You win a while, and then it's done  
Your little winning streak.  
And summoned now to deal  
With your invincible defeat,  
You live your life as if it's real,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
You lose your grip, and then you slip  
Into the Masterpiece.  
And maybe I had miles to drive,  
And promises to keep:  
You ditch it all to stay alive,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow,  
The wretched and the meek,  
We gather up our hearts and go,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
Confined to sex, we pressed against  
The limits of the sea:  
I saw there were no oceans left  
For scavengers like me.  
I made it to the forward deck.  
I blessed our remnant fleet  
And then consented to be wrecked,  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.  
  
I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed,  
I'm back on Boogie Street.  
I guess they won't exchange the gifts  
That you were meant to keep.

The file on you complete,  
Except what we forgot to do,

I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up

Your bracelets and your brush  
And I call to you, I call to you

When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul  
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much  
It's written in the scriptures  
It's written there in blood  
I even heard the angels declare it from above  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
There ain't no cure for love  
There ain't no cure for love

Be fought again  
The holy dove  
She will be caught again  
Bought and sold  
And bought again  
The dove is never free.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack in everything

We asked for signs  
The signs were sent  
The birth betrayed  
The marriage spent  
Yeah the widowhood  
Of every government  
Signs for all to see.  
  
I can't run no more  
With that lawless crowd  
While the killers in high places  
Say their prayers out loud.  
But they've summoned, they've summoned up  
A thundercloud  
And they're going to hear from me.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
  
You can add up the parts  
But you won't have the sum  
You can strike up the march,  
There is no drum  
Every heart, every heart  
To love will come  
But like a refugee.

But I swear by this song  
And by all that I have done wrong  
I will make it all up to thee.  
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,  
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""  
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,

She's the angel of compassion  
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh  
And every drinker every dancer  
Lifts a happy face to thank her  
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime  
All the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polka-dots  
And it's partner found, it's partner lost  
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:

And the cider's laced with acid  
And the holy spirit's crying, ""where's the beef?""  
And the moon is swimming naked  
And the summer night is fragrant  
With a mighty expectation of relief  
So we struggle and we stagger  
Down the snakes and up the ladder  
To the tower where the blessed hours chime  
And I swear it happened just like this:  
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss  
The gates of love they budged an inch

And my very close companion  
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing  
She's a hundred but she's wearing  
Something tight  
And I lift my glass to the awful truth  
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth  
Except to say it isn't worth a dime  
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice  
And it's once for the devil and once for christ  
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights  
We're busted in the blinding lights,  
Busted in the blinding lights

Where is your famous golden touch?""  
I thought you knew where  
All of the elephants lie down,  
I thought you were the crown prince  
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town.  
  
Just take a look at your body now,  
There's nothing much to save  
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries,  
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""  
  
Now if you can manage to get  
Your trembling fingers to behave,  
Why don't you try unwrapping  
A stainless steel razor blade?  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
There's no hot water  
And the cold is running thin.  
Well, what do you expect from  
The kind of places you've been living in?  
  
Don't drink from that cup,  
It's all caked and cracked along the rim.  
That's not the electric light, my friend,

Cover up your face with soap, there,  
Now you're Santa Claus.  
And you've got a gift for anyone  
Who will give you his applause.

And wasn't it a long way down,  
Ah wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair,  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman,  
Oh, there were times she was just a child,  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild.  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view,  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you.  
That's a hard one to remember,  
Yes it makes you clench your fist.  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways,  
All along your wrist.  
And yes it's come to this,  
It's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
You can still find a job,  
Go out and talk to a friend.  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send.  
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,  
They can give you back your hope,  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope.  
  
But you've used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams.  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward,  
That's a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan,  
The stand in stunt man,

It's just the dress rehearsal rag,  
You know this dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just a dress rehearsal rag.

I got this rig that runs on memories  
And I promise, cross my heart,  
They'll never catch us  
But if they do, just tell them it was me  
  
Yeah I loved you all my life  
And that's how I want to end it

Whatever happened to my eyes  
Happened to your beauty

And all your work it's right before your eyes.

The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide.  
And here's a man still working for your smile.

I cheat and I lie.  
I do what I have to do  
To get by.

My sister, hold on tight.

I'll be marching through the morning,  
Marching through the night,  
Moving cross the borders  
Of My Secret Life.  
  
Looked through the paper.  
Makes you want to cry.  
Nobody cares if the people  
Live or die.  
And the dealer wants you thinking  
That it's either black or white.  
Thank G-d it's not that simple  
In My Secret Life.  
  
I bite my lip.  
I buy what I'm told:  
From the latest hit,  
To the wisdom of old.  
But I'm always alone.  
And my heart is like ice.  
And it's crowded and cold  
In My Secret Life.

It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes  
So I was with you, O sweet compassion  
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion  
Compassion with the sting of iodine  
  
Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine  
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine  
And pity in the room like iodine

And all my wanton lust was iodine  
My masquerade of trust was iodine  
And everywhere the flare of iodine

At the alpha and the omega,  
At the cradle of the river and the seas.

And you're sleeping in your harness  
And the wind going wild  
In the trees,  
And it ain't exactly prison

For whatever you've done  
With the keys.

It's dark now and it's snowing  
O my love I must be going,  
The river has started to freeze.  
And I'm sick of pretending  
I'm broken from bending  
I've lived too long on my knees.  
  
Then she dances so graceful  
And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease.  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And comes to you  
Light as the breeze.

There's blood on every bracelet  
You can see it, you can taste it,  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please.

But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise.

At the alpha and the omega,

Out of which the Nameless makes  
A Name for one like me.

Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door

In formless circumstance.

That nobody else had to die

Take my books, take my gun

Climbed out of the water  
Crying, Papa, you promised to play

And they hide, they hide in the World

Saying, When will she summon me  
When will she come to me  
What must I do to prepare  
When she bends to my longing  
Like a willow, like a fountain  
She stands in the luminous air  
And the night comes on  
And it's very calm  
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone  
I'll be yours, yours for a song  
  
Now the crickets are singing  
The vesper bells ringing  
The cat's curled asleep in his chair  
I'll go down to Bill's Bar  
I can make it that far  
And I'll see if my friends are still there  
Yes, and here's to the few  
Who forgive what you do

shoe  
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to
look through  
  
I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit  
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it  
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon  
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all
in a ruin  
  
I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school  
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule  
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in
the pool  
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool  
  
An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you  
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue

And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your

The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb  
The grunt of unity when he came in  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
I was not seized by jealousy at all  
In fact a burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
  
I listened to your kisses at the door  
I never heard the world so clear before  
You ran your bath and you began to sing  
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing  
  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
  
And I can't wait to tell you to your face  
And I can't wait for you to take my place  
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart  
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart  
It's written on the walls of this hotel  
You go to heaven once you've been to hell  
  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control

Leonard Cohen,Passing Through,/l/leonard+cohen/passing+through_20082820.html,"I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary  
""do you hate mankind for what they done to you? ""  
He said, ""talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.  
I've so little time and I'm only passing through.""  
Passing through, passing through.  
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,  
Glad that I ran into you.  
Tell the people that you saw me passing through.  
I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,  
I said ""now you're out, what are you going to do? ""  
""plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.  
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through.""  
Passing through, passing through ...  
I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.  
I said, ""how come the men here suffer like they do? ""  
""men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right  
Even though they know they're only passing through""  
Passing through, passing through ...  
I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.  
He said, ""one world must come out of world war two"" (ah, the fool)  
""yankee, russian, white or tan,"" he said, ""a man is still a man.  
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through.""  
Passing through, passing through ...

Leonard Cohen,Sisters Of Mercy,/l/leonard+cohen/sisters+of+mercy_20082887.html,"Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone.  
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on.  
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song.  
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long.  
  
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control.  
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul.  
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned:  
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned.  
  
Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them.  
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem.  
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn  
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem.  
  
When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon.  
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon.  
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night:  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right,  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

And kept the vision in her soul  
No one believed what she had seen  
No one believed what she heard

And mercy, mercy in this world  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we have done and can't undo

We've been around, we fall, we fly  
We mostly fall, we mostly run  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that we've done  
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest  
I've got this joy in my breast  
To Think that I did not forget that child  
That song of Bernadette  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo  
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you

Leonard Cohen,Story Of Isaac,/l/leonard+cohen/story+of+isaac_20082852.html,"The door it opened slowly,  
My father he came in,  
I was nine years old.  
And he stood so tall above me,  
His blue eyes they were shining  
And his voice was very cold.  
He said, ""I've had a vision  
And you know I'm strong and holy,  
I must do what I've been told.""  
So he started up the mountain,  
I was running, he was walking,  
And his axe was made of gold.  
  
Well, the trees they got much smaller,  
The lake a lady's mirror,  
We stopped to drink some wine.  
Then he threw the bottle over.  
Broke a minute later  
And he put his hand on mine.  
Thought I saw an eagle  
But it might have been a vulture,  
I never could decide.  
Then my father built an altar,  
He looked once behind his shoulder,  
He knew I would not hide.  
  
You who build these altars now  
To sacrifice these children,  
You must not do it anymore.  
A scheme is not a vision  
And you never have been tempted  
By a demon or a god.  
You who stand above them now,  
Your hatchets blunt and bloody,  
You were not there before,  
When I lay upon a mountain  
And my father's hand was trembling  
With the beauty of the word.  
  
And if you call me brother now,  
Forgive me if I inquire,  
""just according to whose plan?""  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will kill you if I must,  
I will help you if I can.  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will help you if I must,  
I will kill you if I can.  
And mercy on our uniform,  
Man of peace or man of war,  
The peacock spreads his fan.

You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her,  
And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you wanna be there,  
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China,  
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,  
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer,  
That you've always been her lover.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that she will trust you,  
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.  
  
And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water,  
And He spent a long time watching from His lonely wooden tower,  
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see him,  
He said ""all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them,""  
But He Himself was broken, long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with him,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you think maybe you'll trust him,  
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,  
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,  
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour,  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,  
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,  
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,  
While Suzanne holds the mirror.

And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that you can trust her,  
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
Whatever useless things these hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down

My poverty revealed,  
I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry, ""Now you must try my greed.""

Through which the troops have passed,  
I stand in ruins behind you,  
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,

Untie for me your hired blue gown,  
Like you would do for one that you love.  
  
You're faithful to the better man,  
I'm afraid that he left.  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death.  
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves  
That he's shaken from his head.  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,

There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry  
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows  
There's a tree where the doves go to die  
There's a piece that was torn from the morning,  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you, I want you, I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly,  
In some hallway where love's never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating,  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take its broken waist in your hand  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
There's a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
They've been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears?  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years  
  
There's an attic where children are playing,  
Where I've got to lie down with you soon,  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns,  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow,  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And I'll dance with you in Vienna  
I'll be wearing a river's disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,  
With the photographs there, and the moss  
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And you'll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love, o my love  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
It's yours now. It's all that there is

I was dancing with my darlin'

When an old friend I happened to see  
Introduced him to my loved one  
And while they were waltzing  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
Now I know just how much I have lost  
Yes I lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.  
She comes dancing through the darkness  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
And I feel like I'm falling apart  
And it's stronger than drink  
And it's deeper than sorrow  
This darkness she's left in my heart.

I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right  
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor  
whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
  
Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe  
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee  
She says, ""My body is the light, my body is the way""  
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet  
  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove  
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood  
And there is no man or woman who can't be touched  
But you who come between them will be judged  
  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

Leonard Cohen,Waiting For The Miracle,/l/leonard+cohen/waiting+for+the+miracle_20082883.html,"Baby, I've been waiting,  
I've been waiting night and day.  
I didn't see the time,  
I waited half my life away.  
There were lots of invitations  
And I know you sent me some,  
But I was waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
I know you really loved me.  
But, you see, my hands were tied.  
I know it must have hurt you,  
It must have hurt your pride  
To have to stand beneath my window  
With your bugle and your drum,  
And me I'm up there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Ah I don't believe you'd like it,  
You wouldn't like it here.  
There ain't no entertainment  
And the judgments are severe.  
The Maestro says it's Mozart  
But it sounds like bubble gum  
When you're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Waiting for the miracle  
There's nothing left to do.  
I haven't been this happy  
Since the end of World War II.  
  
Nothing left to do  
When you know that you've been taken.  
Nothing left to do  
When you're begging for a crumb  
Nothing left to do  
When you've got to go on waiting  
Waiting for the miracle to come.  
  
I dreamed about you, baby.  
It was just the other night.  
Most of you was naked  
Ah but some of you was light.  
The sands of time were falling  
From your fingers and your thumb,  
And you were waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come  
  
Ah baby, let's get married,  
We've been alone too long.  
Let's be alone together.  
Let's see if we're that strong.  
Yeah let's do something crazy,  
Something absolutely wrong  
While we're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Nothing left to do  
  
When you've fallen on the highway  
And you're lying in the rain,  
And they ask you how you're doing  
Of course you'll say you can't complain  
If you're squeezed for information,  
That's when you've got to play it dumb  
You just say you're out there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.

(Angels) We told you so  
We told you dear  
You didn't have  
To come here  
  
The human life  
Is full of quirks  
We can't work it out  
Nothing works  
  
It's a lemon  
This mechanic  
Live, love, suffer  
Die and panic  
  
It lives, it loves  
Suffers and dies  
It eats cow's meat  
And apple pies  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
And full of fear  
Anxiety and strife..  
This is the human life!  
  
... We have many duties still  
Much gold and silver light to spill  
On anxious boys and frightened girls like you...

Who in your merry merry month of may,  
Who by very slow decay,  
And who shall I say is calling?  
  
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate,  
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt,  
And who by avalanche, who by powder,  
Who for his greed, who for his hunger,  
And who shall I say is calling?  
  
And who by brave assent, who by accident,  
Who in solitude, who in this mirror,

Who in mortal chains, who in power,

Why don't your try to forget him?  
Just open up your dainty little hand  
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions  
Many satisfying one-night stands  
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower?  
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?  
Do you want to give your blessing to his power  
As he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave  
  
I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony  
Well, that is if I remember the way  
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery

It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose  
Or lead me to a dance!

When this prostitute attacked me  
You can see she left her mark

You let your foreman send me away  
Yes, you were there, and turned aside

To call them to arms  
To bring them in line!  
Marius, you're late.  
  
Jean Provaire:  
What's wrong today?  
You look as if you've seen a ghost.  
  
Grantaire:  
Some wine and say what's going on!

A ghost you say... a ghost maybe  
She was just like a ghost to me  
One minute there, and she was gone!  
  
Grantaire:  
I am agog!  
I am aghast!  
Is Marius in love at last?  
I have never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah'  
You talk of battles to be won  
But here he comes like Don Ju-an  
It's better than an o-per-a!  
  
Enjolras:  
It is time for us all  
To decide who we are...  
Do we fight for the right  
To a night at the opera now?  
Have you asked of yourselves  
What's the price you might pay?  
Is it simply a game  
For rich young boys to play?  
The colors of the world  
Are changing  
Day by day...  
Red - the blood of angry men!  
Black - the dark of ages past!  
Red - a world about to dawn!  
Black - the night that ends at last!  
  
Marius:  
Had you been there tonight  
You might know how it feels  
To be struck to the bone  
In a moment of breathless delight!  
Had you been there tonight  
You might also have known  
How the world may be changed  
In just one burst of light!  
And what was right  
Seems wrong  
And what was wrong  
Seems right...

Marius, you're no longer a child  
I do not doubt you mean it well  
But now there is a higher call  
Who cares about your lonely soul  
We strive toward a larger goal  
Our little lives don't count at all!

Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short.  
Grantaire, put the bottle down!  
Do we have the guns we need?

Gavroche  
Listen everybody!  
General Lamarque  
Is dead!  
  
Enjolras  
Lamarque is dead.  
Lamarque! His death is the hour of fate.  
The people's man.  
His death is the sign we await!  
On his funeral day they will honor his name.  
With the light of rebellion, a blaze in their eyes.  
From the candles of grief we will kindle our flame!  
On the tomb of Lamarque shall the barricade rise!  
The time is here!  
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer  
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts  
But a jubilant shout  
They will come one and all  
They will come when we call!

But he couldn't run forever  
We have found his hideaway  
And he's just been re-arrested  
And he comes to court today.  
Of course he now denies it  
You'd expect that of a con  
But he couldn't run forever,  
No, not even Jean Valjean!

And gives no sign of understanding or repentance?  
You say this man is going to trial  
And that's he's sure to be returned  
To serve his sentence?  
Come to that, can you be sure,  
That I am not your man?

The cries in the dark that nobody hears,  
Here where I stand at the turning of the years.  
If there is another way to go  
I missed it twenty long years ago.  
My life was a war that could never be won  
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean  
When they chained me and let me for dead  
Just for stealing a mouth full of bread.  
Yet why did I allow that man  
To touch my sould and teach me love?  
He treated me like any other.  
He gave me his trust.  
He called me Brother.  
My life he claims for God above.  
Can such things be?  
For I had come to hate the world.  
This world that always hated me!  
Take an eye for an eye.  
Turn your heart into stone.  
This is all I have lived for.  
This is all I have known.  
One word from him and I'd be back  
Beneath the lash, upon the rack.  
Instead, he offers me my freedom.  
I feel my shame inside me like a knife,  
He told me that I had a soul.  
How does he know?  
What spirit comes to move my life?  
Is there another way to go?  
I am reaching, but I fall,  
And the night is closing in,  
And I stare into the void,  
To the whirpool of my sin.  
I'll escape now from the world  
From the world of Jean Valjean.  
Jean Valjean is nothing now.  
Another story must begin!

Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord

He's the right pick  
But if you choose the wrong pick  
Your step-son will probably end up in Iraq quick  
  
His health care plan is so immaculate

He do what he do like give his wife a hug then a fist dap

See how shit come back round for ya  
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it  
See how shit come back round for ya  
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble  
And you can knock on my door  
But you can't knock the hustle  
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen  
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me  
Lil' Weezy Wee gon' eat that's how it is  
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive  
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens

And I'm a shine 'cause I got shining in my bloodline  
I get that dough 'cause I got hustle in my bloodline  
I bleed concrete  
  
And when I move, I move out with the raw  
I move out with the squad  
To his album we ride we so mob  
I throw lives and lowest to live  
For my loaf of bread the people's player  
I did what the culture said  
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid  
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head  
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead  
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled  
I'm pumping O's with lots of hay  
I'm so high and really I don't even know why  
And oh I just go buy a whole house  
And lay my mat down lay her back down  
But I never put my mack down

You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-be  
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder be  
If you want it then come to me  
I'm right here

I'm G'd up  
Only follow the code of the streets  
Live bad to die good  
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food  
But just so I can eat  
And ain't it a bitch  
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich  
And you probably can see me for some crack before six  
And after that it's all bricks  
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight  
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam  
I skate with the bomb  
I'm asking you don't play with me at all  
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all  
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoe prints  
Cause I did and do shit that's better than new shit  
Fit for two clips  
The kid is a nuisance  
Aw man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music  
And the Blueprint  
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit  
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez

Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma  
Nigga get over here like Scorpion  
And when it comes down to this recording  
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan  
No, I want ringsfor my performance  
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist  
Same coach, same game, been starting  
...Same triangle offense  
I come through the lane like dargent  
Refree niggaz is lame they call charging  
I have no brain I'm retarded  
We are not the same I'ma Martian  
You can be my Jane i'm your Tarzan  
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison  
I am magnificent like Marcus  
You might wanna fall back like August  
Or late september whatever you call it  
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage  
I am talking to no particular audience  
But understand I'm the guardian  
And understand there won't be no guardin him  
You will just get played like an accordion  
I don't give a damn if she's bossy  
I keep pussy running like a faucet  
She better catch like she Steve Largent  
Because I'm ""What's up"" like ""Martin""

See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you here sometimes  
But um um since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you baby

Lil Wayne,Dr. Carter,/l/lil+wayne/dr+carter_20744172.html,"Where's my coffee?  
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)  
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)  
Your first patient (yeah)  
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)  
Originality (ugh)  
His flow is weak (another one)  
And he has no style (ugh)  
What'cha got for um?  
  
OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.  
Dr.carter to the rescue.  
Excuse me if I'm late,  
But like a thief it takes time to be this great  
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,  
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.  
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,  
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix  
Whatever you shall break.  
Where is your originality?  
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.  
Capture what I say.  
All I need is one mic.  
All I need is one take.  
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.  
Watch the gun-play like.  
No kidding, no kids in the way,  
But the kids do watch.  
Gotta watch what we say.  
Gotta work everyday.  
Gotta not be cliche.  
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.  
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.  
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait  
Think I think I lost 'em  
  
Good afternoon doctor carter  
Nurse  
I don't know about this one  
His confidence is down  
Vocab and metaphors needs work  
And he lost respect for the game  
Ah let me see  
Think you can save him?  
  
OK.  
Respect is in the heart.  
So that's where I'm a start.  
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.  
Now hey kid  
Plural I graduated  
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.  
And that was called recycling  
Or re-reciting  
Something cause you just like it  
So you say it just like it.  
Some say its biting  
But I say its enlightening  
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.  
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.  
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.  
Arthritis in my hand from writing.  
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.  
So I stop writing.  
Now I'm like lighting.  
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.  
Fast and exciting.  
My passion is frighting.  
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.  
Here take this Vicodin  
Like it and love it  
And confidence has no budget  
So pay me no mind  
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running  
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit  
God damn it I've lost another one  
  
Good evening doctor carter its been a long day  
But this one looks much better then the others  
His respect is back up  
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement  
All he needs now is some swagger  
OK let me take my gloves off then  
  
Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.  
Fly go hard like geese erection.  
Fashion patrol police detection.  
I stay tight like Chinese connection.  
I stay tight like pussy at night.  
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.  
But I'm too wrong to write.  
Too fresh to fight.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
I had to say it twice  
Swagger so nice.  
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.  
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.  
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.  
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.  
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.  
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.  
I can only see flow.  
His blood starting to flow.  
His lungs starting to grow.  
This one starting to show.  
Strong signs of life.  
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.  
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.  
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.  
  
He looks good  
His vitals are up  
He's looking good  
He's looking good  
I think we got one  
Doctor carter I think we got one  
Yup we got one  
We saved him  
He's good  
He's good  
We got one  
He's good  
He's good  
We got 'em  
He's a go  
He's good

Had that Snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze  
She from the hood but look like she from overseas

I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya""  
She say ""Fuck these other niggas they ain't half of ya

Now I'm drooling on my chain what happened to Wayne?  
I'm like hold up wait a second, yall thought I was second?  
Hating on a champ throwing salt and not confetti  
We pull up and we shoot then we park the car and at it  
Watch me pull up with no roof that's cause I walk the dog and pet it, I'm like
hold up wait a minute yall thought I was finished?  
Shoot you in your head then just walk off like I didn't  
Let my money talk so much put my jawbone outta business  
Doing numbers in this bitch I'm like a smart bone with the digits, Bitch!  
Riding round with the volume down, with the windows up and the choppers down  
Soon as we get to yo block it's the fucking other way around  
My bitch say I'm too wild she don't even know why she stay around  
I get home and I dick her down now she talking bout' exchange the vows  
If these bullets was paint balls I could fuck around and I could paint a house  
You could tell I pimpin' the way I hit the blunt with my pinky out  
I bring Wine to Amy House we smoke it out and we drank it out, and talk about
these pussy niggas that ain't about what Wayne about  
I'm hanging out a mussane without a brain is outta his mind  
I pull over I push a button it change like Optimus Prime  
Speaking of change it's a shame how these lames dropping them dimes  
We aim at your grape knock it off now you just Vines

Hate in my heart, love in my mind  
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same  
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain  
I search but never find, hurt but never cry  
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind  
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond  
The top gets higher the more that I climb  
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger  
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga  
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'  
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'  
  
Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah

Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you  
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof  
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off  
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off  
Huh, my word is my pride  
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise  
Served to survive, murdered and bribed  
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside  
  
So I could pick the world up

This pain you'll never know  
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold  
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall  
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""Fuck 'em all""  
  
Man, it feels like these walls are closing in  
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then  
Your days are numbered like pages in  
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy  
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all  
Shook and scared to look in my eyes  
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I  
Came up from behind  
And pretty much snuck up  
And butt-fucked this game up  
Better be careful when you bring my name up  
Fuck this fame, that ain't what  
I came to claim but the game  
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it  
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it  
I swear to God, won't spare the rod  
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod  
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!  
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie  
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye  
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die  
My head is swole, my confidence is up  
This stage is my pedestal  
I'm unstoppable, incredible  
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball  
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg  
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce and olives  
I'll fuckin'  
  
Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head

Hold him for ransom hear him this morning

And how to strap up  
When it's time shoot it  
Cock yo' heaters  
Tie up yo' bags  
It's time to do it  
Blaze the blunt  
Shut off the lights  
And cut down the music  
Roll down the windows  
Turn the corner  
And let loose with the,

Then ya never will learn  
You ca play with Lil' Wayne  
And yo' block get burned  
You must love to go swimming  
Cause the water gets deeper  
See I bust you wide open  
And take 'ya daughter with me  
Here come the beat boy  
Shoot out the street lights  
Time to bring on the heat boy  
If you ain't really wit it  
Then you better get back  
I open yo' chest  
And make it look just like a wet cat  
This is a death trap  
I'm a guerrilla and I mean it  
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'  
Not on the cement  
Calicoe steamin'  
Red dot beamin'  
Dressed up suspicious

Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions  
  
What it be like up there baby boy,  
Aye this here ya son hollerin' at ya  
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya  
But I know you watchin', peepin down on how I'm livin'  
Aye, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin'  
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit  
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk  
Say, I'll never forget the time  
That you caught me smokin' herb in the house  
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out  
But you just talked it over with my mom  
And got it situated in due time  
Told me get the paper instead of high  
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog  
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog  
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me  
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me  
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin  
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

I know you see my daughter growin' up and bad as ever  
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her  
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman  
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'  
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child  
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile  
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it  
But I know they love it way more than they hate it  
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these  
Bitches,  
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'  
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective  
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection  
And you see I left school behind and chose C-M-B  
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough  
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely  
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you  
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you  
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes  
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog  
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog  
So I live my life in dedication of you dog  
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within  
Make me want to grab that gun and burst again  
But I know they got a reason why I'm here  
And I know they got a reason why you gone  
And therefore, I'm succeedin' on my own  
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart  
I can't forget you kept it real from the start  
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me  
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me  
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""they's my peoples""  
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you  
  
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know  
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
  
I know I can't be close to you (dog)  
I know you watching over me dog  
But the shit's that it hurt and burn deep  
Its alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

Right Mom, wrong Dad  
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you  
But it just eats me up, like some bbq from Luther's  
In the mornin' with the roosters  
On the corner with the boosters  
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures  
And I wanna talk to her  
But her Mama has to school her  
I wanna see her better  
She's the weather of my future  
I don't wanna see another hurricane  
Baby you can kill the pain  
If you just let me explain  
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'  
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train  
Stuck in the passenger seat  
Travlin' through the fast lane

Well once upon a time, there was a Mom and a Dad  
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had  
A beautiful daughter, two story house, two car garage  
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard  
See Daddy was a doctor  
And Mommy was a banker  
Mommy's job got outsourced  
So now Mommy's dranker  
Daddy had a malpractice suit  
Now he's a snorter  
And all this shit's takin' place  
Right in front of their daughter  
She says, ""Daddy what's wrong?""  
But he's just too high  
""Mommy what we gon' do?""  
She just get drunk and cry  
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right  
Lookin' for answers alone in the darkness of night  
Shit anit right... Lil girl gone some where out there stranded can't nobody
find her and they don't understand it she was raise hood can't blame her

But I'mma be here next week  
So call your company and take off

You got me all impatient""  
Cry me a river  
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself  
You're like a hot revolver  
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself  
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love  
And you go by yourself, so all alone  
  
One minute she love me,  
The next minute she hate me  
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted  
She say she, pray she, have Weezy F's baby  
And I be having seizures  
But she say she can't shake me  
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches  
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted  
I swear I like her more than she think I do  
Girl, when I think of you  
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo  
I suck and fuck and finger you  
But you want me to cling to you  
And I ain't asking you to change  
Cause I know I can't jingle you

And you have your days  
And we gave it our best shot  
But I just got grazed

And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas

And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night

And I wish I never met ya  
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better  
And all I had to do was put two and two together  
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn

Lil Wayne,I Hate Love,/l/lil+wayne/i+hate+love_20904308.html,"She was the sweetest ever  
Whatever happened to forever  
She never say never, she rather say whatever  
I'd rather stay together and she'd rather chase the devil  
Now I'm left to race the rebel  
Bartender make it several  
Turn up the bass and treble  
How bout I make it metal  
I'm such a fatal fellow  
And she's the reason why  
Because without the muthafucker I'd die  
I'd die, I'd die  
So bury me today or tomorrow  
'Cause I've buried myself away  
In the sorrow in may  
I die before I wake  
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake  
  
But you love me  
At least that's what she said  
That whole weekend in my bed  
But there was a speaker in my head  
Saying ""seek and you'll be led""  
But instead, instead I loved you  
I was weak and mislead  
I was deeper than dead  
I was sinking in dread now I'm thinking in shreds  
So I inked this in red  
  
But she loves me  
She loves me not  
  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
I used to tell myself I wouldn't do this to myself  
Until I proved it to myself  
And now I'm losing myself  
I hides to have my shit together but now  
You see now, I'm with whatever  
And now. you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever  
And everybody know I ain't actin' like in supposed  
I'm attacking my own soul  
I'm back in a lone mode  
I'm back on that long road  
And that road goes forever and ever  
  
I don't wanna love no more, spare me  
You can have my heart it's only dead beat  
I'm sick of the loves songs and the bullshit  
When reality bites like a wolf bitch  
She's on top, she wanna kiss  
She won't stop, she don't wanna quite  
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever  
  
She loves me  
She loves me not  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
And I don't want love, I don't want love  
I don't wanna love no more  
So if you see her you can have her  
She'll be outside my door  
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor  
I curse the very day you were born  
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that in guilty

Linda Ronstadt,1917,/l/linda+ronstadt/1917_20149903.html,"The strange young man who comes to me  
A soldier on a three day spree  
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy  
And a woman's arms to hide him  
He greets me with a courtly bow  
And hides his pain by acting proud  
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud  
How can I deny him?  
  
Let us dance beneath the moon  
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'  
The morning always comes too soon  
But tonight the war is over  
He speaks to me in schoolboy French  
Of a soldier's life inside a trench  
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench  
I do my best to please him  
  
He puts two roses in a vase  
Two roses sadly out of place  
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face  
Playfully I tease him  
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies  
Let's not talk of how or why  
Tomorrow's soon enough to die  
But tonight the war is over  
We make love too hard, too fast  
He falls asleep, his face a mask  
He wakes with the shakes, and he drinks from his flask  
I put my arms around him  
  
They die in the trenches and they die in the air  
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere  
They die so, so fast there's no time to prepare  
A decent grave to surround them  
Old world glory, old world fame  
The old world's gone, gone up in flames  
Nothing will ever be the same  
And nothing lasts forever  
Oh, I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how  
And there's nothing, nothing that can save him now  
There's always another with the same funny bow  
And who am I to deny them?

The sun doesn't feel as warm as before  
Stars seem far away and fading from sight  
All the beautiful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Close talks, long walks taken with friends  
Getting dirty playing with the neighborhood kids  
Waking up early to see the sun rise  
All the meaningful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Song birds, summer words in my ear  
The fingers of the wind brushing my hair  
The mold on the leaves as they die each year  
The magical things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now

Well I feel that burning flame  
  
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me  
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Sometimes I stare into space  
Tears all over my face  
I can't explain it don't understand it  
I hadn't ever felt like this before  
  
Now that funny feeling has me amazed  
I don't know what to do my head's in a haze  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart

The children's carousel  
The chestnut tree  
The wishing well

In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you

That cheatin' folks was easier than plowin' his daddy's ground  
He left his home back in Ohio, bound for Chicago's town  
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back  
  
A bullet cut him down  
And as he lay there dying  
He said ""Will I see my Ohio?""

And to become a man  
He'd have to build himself up tall  
  
With fancy folks and land  
He threw some stones at honest friends  
And he got himself these things  
His children left him and he sneered  
  
""That's what my kindness brings""

Used to, have a concept of where I stand,

That you would self-destruct, eventually,  
Now I'm thinking like a mistake I made doesn't hurt, but,  
It's not gonna work,

I wished you were something you were not,  
And now this guilt is really all that I've got, (all)  
  
You turn your back and walk away in shame,  
All you got is a memory of pain,

Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed  
People don't talk about keeping it real  
It's understood that they actually will  
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees  
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze  
Watch them flee, hip-hop hits  
Take a walk with me and what you'll see  
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax  
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue  
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme  
And emcees have left materialism behind them  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might  
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

Because this is dedicated to the kids  
Dedicated to wherever music lives  
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same  
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game  
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong  
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong  
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run  
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun  
  
I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum  
Out on sunset strip, he asked me ""How would you feel  
If everybody acted like you didn't exist  
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip. ""  
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this  
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it  
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest  
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith  
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing  
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain  
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might

One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far

All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be

Give me my space back you gotta just

Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend  
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions, forcefully  
The power of suggestion, then with the eyes shut  
Looking through the rust and rot and dust  
A small spot of light floods the floor  
And pours over the rusted world of pretend  
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up

Pollution manifested in perpetual sound the wheels go round  
And the sunset creeps behind street lamps  
Chain link and concrete  
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn  
Floats on down the street till the wind is gone  
And the memory now is like the picture was then  
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

Can y'all explain, what kind of man is destined?  
When a man has plans of being rich,  
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?  
Dirty money scheme, a clean split,  
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy.  
Talk team, they take the paper route,  
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.  
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience.  
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me.  
Smoke scream, we're going in flames,  
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be,  
Say it's time for things to change.  
We arrange that dope product we built cheap,  
Anything if it's more to gain.  
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep,  
Until no more remains, but I'm still me  
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio  
You record companies kill me  
Try to force me to strain it, no way  
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""  
You feel me? You will see, the greed will be to blame  
Greedy for the fame, tv or a name  
Media, the game, to me your all the same  
You're guilty.

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same (all the same, all the
same).  
Guilty all the same (all the same, all the same),  
Guilty all the same.

So hollow, so vicious  
So afraid I couldn't let myself see  
That I could never be held  
Back up, no, I'll hold myself

Let the rest be to tell they tale

Deep, feeble  
Each word gets lost in the echo

Go, go, go  
  
Test my will, test my heart  
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up  
Y'all go hard, I go smart  
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?  
I've seen that frustration  
Big cross, they're lost but don't know  
And I've come back unshaken  
Let down, I've lived and let go  
So you can let it be known  
I don't hold back, I hold my own  
I can't be mad, I can't be calm  
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone

Hold myself up and love my scars  
Let the bells ring wherever they are

And the blood may wash away

You really must be so lonely  
Puffed up, lookin' tough, but so phony  
You and your boys, you don't know me  
You really wanna hole me?

Something in here's not right today  
Why am I so uptight today?  
Paranoia's all I got left  
I don't know what stressed me first  
Or how the pressure was fed  
But I know just what it feels like  
To have a voice in the back of my head  
It's like a face that I hold inside  
A face that awakes when I close my eyes  
A face that watches everytime I lie  
A face that laughs everytime I fall  
(And watches everything)  
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim  
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
Hey yo  
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind  
But I find myself in places with names but no faces  
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees  
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
The face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!  
  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun goes down  
  
It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun  
  
Can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head

A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.  
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita.  
Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty  
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,  
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.  
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow

the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbelly's
sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse

'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first  
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky

Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one  
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a motherfuckin' ton  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma say it for the record  
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak  
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack  
Closest to a peak, far from a punk

You left my trust on the firing line  
As the promises break, the only mistake -  
Giving you what was mine  
Your words are clear but their meanings gone  
The notes are right but the tunings wrong  
And when you tell me again that I should give in  
I can only take it so long long long long

You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified

Fear is dancing inside your lies  
Exposing secrets that you've disguised  
And I'm biting my tongue as you become  
Victim of a compromise  
Cause I know who you really are  
Not a scratch where you can take a scar  
And it's time that you seek the truth without me  
I can only get you so far far far far

When the music is right  
If you see somebody hangin' around  
Don't get uptight  
The only thing we want to do tonight  
Is go 'round and 'round  
And turn upside down  
Come on! Let's get down!  
  
So come on! Let's get loose  
Don't hold back  
'Cause ain't no use  
Hard to keep your feet on the ground  
'Cause when we like to party  
We only want to get down

Now if I had one wish  
I'd want forever back again

And hold you when you cry

I can remember all those great times we had  
There were so many memories. Some good, some bad  
Yes and through it all  
These memories will last  
Forever  
  
There' peace in where you are  
Maybe all I need to know  
And if I listen to my heart  
I'll hear your laughter once more  
And so I got to say  
I'm just glad you came my way

I was a victor, you were a Cajun queen  
You had many fellas with lots of style  
And you drove them wild  
Oh little Lucy I had to be with you  
  
Traveled around the country  
Oh and I made my way  
I never once forgot what I felt that day  
Now I think I'm ready to play my hand  
I wanna be your man which is hard to do

I've been a wandering man for such a long time  
Now I know just where I'm going

Turning around showing me the thing got power  
  
Started to converse and I sense a problem  
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them  
But she didn't want to hear it  
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it  
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two

With you, goodbye, cause I don't need you with me

Were wasted time, and it's all because of you  
  
I was blind, couldn't see the writing on the wall  
In my mind, you were the only one to be with me  
I can't believe, that it took so long to figure out  
The games you play, now the truth is clear I have no doubt

I'll be gone  
But I left something for you on the pillow  
Put this tape in  
Press play  
I love you  
  
It's four in the morning, I'm sitting here at night  
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind  
I'm leaving in an hour, and you won't be up in time to say goodbye, whoa  
I'm putting this on tape (baby, you're wonderful)  
I really mean it, babe (more than you will ever know)  
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go)  
I'll be back, but in the meantime  
Keep in mind

(What you are)  
Something too big for words  
And it's my pleasure to love you, baby, for better or worse

A beautiful mother to your kids  
Sometimes, it slips my mind, so in case I forget  
(Girl, you are) you're better than (anything)  
I ever had  
(You are) the perfect love  
(Never give you up because you are)  
My heart, my soul, my breath  
Take it all until there's nothing left  
'Cause, baby, you are  
  
Now, no man has ever loved his woman  
More than I love you  
Girl, you know it's true  
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you  
That ain't true (here's what I do)  
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week  
Take you shopping whenever  
More importantly  
Wrap my loving arms around you  
To reassure everything I felt that first night  
I feel it more

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Funny me, funny you  
Don't have nothing lft in common  
You wanted me to have your heart  
Now you want it back  
What about the promise you made to me  
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason  
And suddenly we're flying high  
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast  
You're trying to get lost  
I'm trying to pull up

You said you didn't need me  
I really didn't think that you would leave me

No longer got their respect for me  
Don't want to hear what I'm saying  
I know how it feels to be ashamed  
Cause when I was young I felt that pain too  
And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change  
And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways  
Then who am I fooling  
What am I doing thinking you love me

You would think by this time I would get it right  
Know the schemes and the things that make it be right  
When you said you could stay no longer  
I thought I had just a little more daylight  
LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night  
I know the things I use to do to make you feel right  
I would give anything the fortune I made  
To bring back the days that the feeling was so right

Systematically, burn you like calories  
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary  
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees  
You could catch it like the flu, homey follow me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough  
It's one in the mornin', crack the Mo'  
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'  
It's one in the mornin', who want to go?  
  
That's right Sleeping Beauty, wake up see the light  
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM  
Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin' coliseums  
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin' for per diem  
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum  
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him  
Money's my slave, it do what I say  
It cry for me, like Denzel in ""Glory""  
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty  
I wonder if you hatin' on the low, probably!  
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels  
Damn! Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal  
But you lack the discipline to do what I do  
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension  
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot  
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye yo E it's one o'clock  
Time to get one and bounce baby  
It's time to get one and bounce,  
You know what time it is  
  
Your honor, last week he punched me in my face  
I want twenty million, you know he liftin' weights  
Last week, me and the President was takin' flicks  
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick  
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks  
That cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it  
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted  
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Sumit  
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know  
My po'tfolio was sicker than polio  
For real God is good, he took me out the hood  
Got me livin' in a mansion like a big boy should  
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes  
Knowin' how I live, bed extra big  
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch  
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out  
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce  
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce  
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo  
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago  
But no, in real life cats catch it  
It's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah yeah  
It's the definition  
Definition  
Definition potna, eleven in a row!

Peace to my brothers on ""Rikers' Isle""  
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile  
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin' light is yet to come  
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun  
Females, let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz  
You give me to the ""sploshers"", you can get your-a blast  
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons  
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied  
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone  
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop  
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop  
Dosey-do your partner all night long  
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

Funky-like type of stuff  
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff  
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs  
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover  
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver  
Don't stop till you get it on  
With ya head B-boppin' like a bouncy ball  
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall  
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all  
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static  
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic  
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it  
Here we go, hand over the cash yo  
What chime? Hey yo, blast the Tabasco  
Work your body like a dime, oh no  
Do the freaky-deaky, the whole girls' cargo  
Females on the side, we gotta win 'em, yeah  
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah  
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber  
Makes me sick like an earthquake  
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make  
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house  
Must be eatin' hardy  
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya

Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down

And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?  
Down-home monkey, corn fed, original  
And what you do is up to you, the individual  
This is the place to be for why'all underage brothers  
With the rebel mentality  
Sweet young freaks sayin' ""Rock me ?Arma-day-us?  
Skin so smooth lookin' all ?  
Video to video, tape to tape  
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate  
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge  
Too many people in the crib  
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy  
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady  
Ain't nothin' here petty  
Trip down to your laund-a-ray, I'm ready!  
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force  
And get jaws off, no matter what the cost  
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove  
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes  
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove  
I know the Marley remix to make you move

There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentley's  
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me  
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly  
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty  
  
Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy  
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy  
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi  
On the celly with her man, ""Love you, I'm at the movies""  
  
Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)  
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner  
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her

Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly  
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli  
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly

Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many  
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley

Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather

Looking for a little, that's my theory  
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting  
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting  
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking, learning, the one you're liking  
Listen and you will love what I'm writing

Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the land's highest law  
The man of the brand, one you look out for  
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last, leader of the class, see  
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's  
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E  
I bust your lip, my level won't slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip  
Come on!

When I die, there will be no lovers left  
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer

Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love, the man you dream of

Never ever lost, not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro  
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo  
Come on

All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand  
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list  
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless

Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return

They want a man to work with his hands  
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn

[Chorus]  
  
Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon  
When you need a toga-black, hire black linen  
Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job  
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob  
The black women don't understand  
Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man  
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk  
Seein' black women and white men go to work  
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real  
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal  
Hold my hand while I get it all together  
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather  
Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls  
And there's another way besides basketball  
Let me go, let me do what I do  
I'm red, black and green, then red, white and blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ridin' in the street you can feel the city heat  
A little bit of grass and a whole lot of concrete  
Creepin', I'm standin' on the corner  
And you can get robbed if you want to  
Paybacks a mother on the street  
You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats  
Brothers ride by real slow  
You get leary when they got tinted windows  
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt  
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front  
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God  
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard  
Government got a hell of a plan  
But word is born they ain't destroyin' this black man  
  
[Chorus: x2]

To yachts with helicopters, I'm so hot  
Paparazzi, blinded by the rocks  
My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked cause  
You steppin out with an entrepeneur  
I copped you more than what you bargained for  
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits  
First, let's make love in the walk-in closet  
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit  
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic  
I'm the captain of my destiny  
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see  
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such  
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch  
You stood by my side and pushed me so much  
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?  
  
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing  
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby  
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy  
To see my baby is so amazing  
  
Sing it baby  
  
I've got riches wall to wall  
Up the stairs and, down the hall of  
All the things that we have done  
You got more ideas for us to  
Live our lives and explore  
There is no topping you, you're untoppable  
  
So what you sayin'? Uh-huh  
Hehehe, I appreciate it  
  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me

(I'll always love you)

Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water  
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky  
A vowel on the end of everything we buy  
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie  
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie  
It feels so good it make a grown man cry  
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died  
I guess I had determination  
And baby girl kept me in the congregation  
Now it's private jets and deep conversation  
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation  
All eyes on us, the cameras flash  
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash  
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed  
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back  
  
This is like this for life baby  
This gon' always be like this  
God is my witness  
Hold you tight for the rest of my life

I want to send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide  
City to city, ghetto to ghetto  
Some flavor for you and yours  
And your jeep  
  
You're the type of girl that got class and style  
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while  
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for  
Hardcore  
I know you want to come, in my jeep  
We can park on a back street  
You're checkin' out my car phone, scopin' out my jewelry  
Let's do this in a hurry  
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken  
I know you need a good stickin'  
That's when I see my man Snoop  
Peace, what up kid? loungin' duke  
As I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier  
You're gettin' hornier and hornier  
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape (flavor)  
You're legs is incredible, I do a double take  
You're puttin' on your lipstick  
I want to give you this big fat (yea)  
Quick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep

Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'  
  
I'm pullin' over near your building  
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'  
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this  
You got class but deep down you're real freakish  
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode  
That's when me and my jeep showed  
Up with the funk in the trunk and  
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'  
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy  
Cause I know you're feelin' frisky  
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky  
You got your eyes on the hood  
You're up to no good  
I took you in the back, you hoped I would  
You got your black on black so stacked in the back  
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track  
Windows are foggy  
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby  
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets  
I give it to you real raw in the backseat  
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)  
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)  
Don't lie  
Take it in your eye (why?)  
So buckle up, buckle up  
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh  
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live  
I'll put your numbers in the archives  
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl  
It's my jeep and your world  
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing  
'cause I can tell you want to swing

We're bonin' on the dark blocks  
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock  
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it  
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it  
Workin' as a team  
Somebody, anybody (scream)  
Jump with me to the cash bar  
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' ""wah""  
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip  
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip  
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)  
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth  
Extensions on the carpet  
That nice round brown is my target  
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy  
I love it when it's pushy  
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)  
The back seat of my jeep, is priceless  
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action  
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'  
  
Give me a hug  
See what I'm sayin' love?

Never go against me, you lack resources  
What? I skywalk with the forces  
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches  
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses  
Maserati coup, take galloping horses  
Nah, there's never been one like me  
They're looking for a new me as if there might be  
Even with a love song, that's unlikely  
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me

But now I teach class, put back Tony

Giving all for my soul to have another smash  
Yea, LL Cool J  
30 years later, be me for a day  
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway  
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray  
Cats on my team, got NBA  
But it's my black, from the web we stay  
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age  
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised  
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains  
But the money's coming in in 360 ways

We used to walk down the block hold hands  
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man  
And any guys that want to socialize  
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries  
My peeps used to say I was whipped  
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped  
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt  
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt  
I would look up at ya I remember  
The afternoon you surrendered  
We made love the temperature was high as could be  
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""  
And as we went our separate ways you turned back  
Smiled, I remember all that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Take it to the bridge)  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
I need your love  
Each and every day  
  
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call  
Of days when love was true I slept and held you  
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you  
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts  
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught  
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me  
Sweet love strictly  
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side  
Take you for a mental and emotional ride  
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind  
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time  
And as long as you support my dreams  
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team  
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of  
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
(You'll be my candy girl forever)  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
(Word is bond sweetheart)  
I need your love  
(I swear I'm down for whatever)  
Candy girl  
(sometimes you gotta go back home)  
Look so sweet

Can't explain it  
My love when we're together  
You're the greatest, nobody does it better  
When you hold me  
I wish that I could be your, one and only  
Nobody does it better  
  
I understand you want canaries on your hand  
Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band  
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand  
You don't want to make it happen unless it's the right man  
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me  
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me  
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender  
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender  
Let me kiss your eyes  
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe  
I pull back to stare at your eyes  
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized  
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile  
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style  
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while  
Let's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle  
I can't explain it

Straight up, you beautiful b  
I don't think you understand what you doin' to me  
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin' TV  
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin' me  
uh then we kiss for real  
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel  
You go to the bathroom for a second  
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)  
That's when you come back and walk to me slow  
That's when you change up and let it all flow  
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow  
I love to take my time, love to give you a show  
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below  
Use my ears like handlebars, take control  
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role  
Baby relax, let me touch your soul  
I can't explain it

My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks  
with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)  
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch  
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch  
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean  
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen  
You the 6 I needed you like a fix  
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click  
I pick up the pace  
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face  
I look at your lips and take a taste  
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist  
We whylin' out, we all over the place  
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace  
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith  
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it

She said her name Shaiyeeda  
I could tell her mama feed her  
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit  
I'm L, nice to meet ya.  
I could feel my body yearnin'  
The room just started turnin'  
Didn't wanna go out on the floor  
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance)  
My brain began to sizzle  
I'm sweatin' just a little  
On the dance floor in the middle,  
She turned around and giggled,  
She said

How we lust for one another  
We barely know eachother  
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh)  
The air is filled with passion  
The strobe lights are flashin'  
The hustlers throw cash n  
The bar tender keeps splashin'  
Her moves were so erotic  
Her games were so hypnotic  
I bet this girl could stop it  
But she continued to pop it  
  
You know I know you like it,

Her lip gloss  
Her hips toss  
Back and forth  
Side to side and  
Up and down  
She touched the ground  
It turned me out.  
I'm battlin' desire,  
Lord help me douse this fire  
This internal inferno,  
Hotter than a shot of cuervo  
Her top was short and purple  
Belly dancin' in a circle  
When I feel like this I can't resist

The rain pours down  
Eyes are blood-shot  
Heartbeat pounds.  
Lights go out  
The whole world's in darkness  
The ground is tremblin'  
Dogs are barkless.  
In the sky there appears a great light  
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.  
Cryin' in a childless tone  
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.  
Don't smile  
Lest a innocent Chile  
The power of God is gonna get to be your Tao  
Throw like a hit from the best  
Take it in a slump  
Ha ha  
Feel it in your chest.  
Conquering the world with the words  
Leading the children like herds.  
I can feel it building  
I'm about to explode  
I'm walking on the crossroad

People living in a shack, at the crossroads  
Little kids selling crack, at the crossroads  
Stab you in the back, at the crossroads  
Everybody's getting jacked at the crossroads  
  
Violins and trumpets play  
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh  
On there way to the promise land.  
Deliverance  
But yet some don't understand.  
Rough on a late night thrill  
After midnight  
Kill or be killed.  
Soldiers, warriors  
At each other  
On the combat zone.  
Supreme power on the throne.  
Lighting strikes in every home.  
Terrified men run down the street.  
So many dead bodies  
It's hard to eat.  
Come, we gotta rise  
Above the wall.  
To see what no man has seen before.  
Blindin' light  
That got you through the night.  
God is on your side  
To got in a fight.

Homicide  
Suicide  
Death.  
Boom!  
Ain't nobody left.  
Oh! It's starting to take affect.  
Your on your knees  
You scared to death.  
Tornado's with a thousand people spinning.  
One fight at the cross  
And now God is wining.  
The whole Earth cracks in half.  
The sea turns red from the blood bath.  
Abandoned buildings burned  
And two remain  
Terrified.  
You feel the fire blaze.  
The ground can't hold your weight.  
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.  
Who clocked this fuck  
Not from space.  
Never again  
Will you see the human race.  
19 angels leading the Devil straight to Hell!  
Torment!  
Pain!  
What you're seeing here  
You can't explain.  
All your life  
Some men  
We played the game.  
Never realize that there's a flame.

LL Cool J,Dangerous,/l/ll+cool+j/dangerous_20184750.html,"His realm is a new horizon of cuts  
They expand from his hand as he conducts  
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography  
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography  
  
The lyrical virtual also makes his return  
All adversaries should be concerned  
LL Cool J is back again  
Let me allow to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator  
  
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves  
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave  
English revision he endure any collision  
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision  
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate  
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best  
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter  
All you sucker DJ's will scatter  
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy  
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name  
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain  
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains  
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change  
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry  
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous  
  
""I need a beat""  
  
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished  
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished  
My scenario, four-door stereo  
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio  
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J  
Say: ""Ole"", to what we just played  
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade  
And all competitors will be slayed  
Any comment is a compliment  
No groups' talent can be the equivalent  
Of mine and his combined  
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme  
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass  
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place  
A performance underrated, it's not narrated  
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated  
He's dangerous  
  
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second  
I called an old phrase from my last record  
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels  
Except I came hear to raise some hell  
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like the blade  
He the scuser dry-smudge and make Coolay  
I drink at steady, the record turns many  
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete  
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved as the record revolves  
DJ's dissolve, usually, physically, mentally  
He's an innovator, greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader  
Sometime I gotta check what I invest  
All Farmers Boulevard is where I rest  
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego  
Such palms kill a France, say, en Italiano  
The mouth protects and I'll inject into your ears  
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unfair  
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail

In every disco you say hello  
Like you're a little angel, but we all know

Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.

A high-powered body makes your Levis grow  
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze  
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.  
That's a General Education on Decency  
One day you'll see, and agree with me  
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93  
For you there's no fee, everything is free  
This is from me to you, not you to me  
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight  
You try to shake your butt with all your might  
I don't really wanna dis nobody  
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette  
How bad can a girl's reputation get?  
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met  
If you're desperate ask Yvette, cause she'll say ""Bet"".

B-Boys are hard on the boulevard  
The Reverend at the church said you was barred  
Homeboys on the block love you a lot  
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not  
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'  
Let me explain to you who is talkin'  
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way  
You boogie down to my records almost every day  
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still  
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill  
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.  
The guy at the desk said it was OK  
For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay  
Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'  
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high

Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen

Many devilish goals are up (uh) soon!  
No love where loves' ya dwell in

Ice, murders, conspiracy and (uh) schemes!

Handguns in the hands of the young  
And diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone

No need for the coping now  
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar  
Made a vow before God to love me  
And finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I will never second guess us how  
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together  
Having kids together, my life begins right now  
  
Finally the day has arrived  
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle  
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild  
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles  
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it  
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it  
Take the vow to be together forever  
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever  
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds  
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out  
I was blind to love, God showed me you  
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say ""I do""  
And I do

Butterflies, my palms are sweaty  
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready  
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere  
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here  
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand  
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand  
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right  
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight  
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife  
Us both dressed alike in the purest white  
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around  
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows

It's a beautiful and heavenly day  
As the pastor asks, ""Who gives this woman away?""  
Your father says ""I do"" and gives me a hand

He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and  
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'  
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'  
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment  
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live  
But still find time for you and homework with the kids  
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded  
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""

I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace  
In any case, yo, I'm moving like a steeplechase  
MC soldiers, about face  
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff  
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft  
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this  
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist  
Whipper-snapper back up for coming crap up  
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em  
Phony, so skip the baloney  
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony  
And roll, cause you're just a rookie  
When it was time for rap school, you must of played hooky  
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper  
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper  
Just getting warmer, I'm a transform a  
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer  
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough  
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged  
I drop like a sandbag  
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag  
Best of the batch, no man can catch up  
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mis match  
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat  
And avoid combat like a diplomat  
But when it's time for back lash, jacked or killed  
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill  
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes  
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime  
I rock the mic unlike  
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, pysch!  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Dropping 'em  
  
Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin  
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline  
I get busy like it's two of me  
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's  
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax  
And take the crowd to the climax  
Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray  
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way  
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz  
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz  
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made  
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade  
MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck  
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck  
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy  
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys  
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox  
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox  
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull  
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful  
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult  
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult  
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum  
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Yo E, dropping 'em  
  
Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper  
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper  
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper  
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a  
Emcee, like he's one of the two  
Break him into fragments right in front of you  
Mic check one two, is too fundamental  
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental  
In the center, I had to enter  
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor  
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers  
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a  
Rude awakening, you can't do anything  
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring  
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence  
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced  
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator  
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader  
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker  
Eating up the world, acre by acre  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Word to mother, dropping 'em!  
Know what I'm saying? Straight til 1999, dropping 'em!  
Yo, year two thousand, ya know what I'm saying?

I wasn't tryin' to be mean  
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)  
Cause your persistence overpowers me  
I know you rollin' out with me

Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms  
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage  
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice  
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white  
That's when I realized it'll be a long night  
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white  
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic  
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might  
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype

DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing

Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'  
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'  
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled  
What would you do, if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?  
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong

Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?

Sometimes for going outside to play  
Late at night on my knees I'd pray  
A young child, wishing the pain would go away  
Dad where was you when he made me strip  
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip  
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow  
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'

Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door

Baby you the star of the big boy show

Leave all my jewels cos you love it when I stunt  
Ill play any role accept being the chump  
My Jon lil' girl you love it when I crunk  
Your boy told sniff I'm the future of the funk  
Pretend we lil' kids play tag and dry hum

When Def Jam signed me  
They hit the lottery  
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery  
They underestimated me quite possibly  
It's like that when you a godfather b  
I'm the greatest of all time  
You heard that before  
But now when I say it  
It means so much more  
Cause It's so true  
No hype man, No crew  
No reason for ghost writers  
Every year I get tighter  
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire  
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire  
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire  
You think I'm hot  
You preaching to the choir  
Smiling and giggling  
Thirsting like Gilligan  
More flavor than cinnamon  
They rush with adrenaline  
I make 'em nervous  
I do it on purpose  
I come back hotter  
Every time I resurface  
Drop to ya knees baby  
Praise the king  
Now ask Russell Simmons  
Who built the west wing  
I ain't gotta be cocky  
I do the damn thing  
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting  
Internationally known and respected  
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected

Born with a gift to inspire the hood  
You want to out do me and I wish you would  
I'm the master separate from all these cats  
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that  
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs  
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax  
That's understandable but everybody relax  
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act  
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact  
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react  
Been had an entourage and platinum cards  
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton  
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don  
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond  
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted  
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it  
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it  
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it  
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row  
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show

These rap cats get upset with me  
When security clear out the V.I.P  
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID  
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee  
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot  
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot  
While you waste advances on gray market rocks  
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks  
A family man but hard as a rock  
And I die for my kids so stay off my block  
They might be impressed with you but I'm not  
After all these years I still walk with a bop  
Still keep the ink hot  
Still scheme like a fox  
Still ready to battle  
You don't want your career stopped  
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot  
And ran around humble with my joint on cock

You could fuse it, if ya choose it 'cause it's deep rooted  
I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter  
For underestimating as I'm creating the butter  
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm dropping  
I'm wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit  
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out  
I'm wrecking niggas one-by-one but then I miscount  
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce  
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya fagots into mush  
Ya slipping, I'm gripping microphones real tight  
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night  
Deliver messages, the prophecy's in me

You clowns know when I bring forth the heat

Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers  
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live

Black and blue, trying ta hide up in the spectrum

Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that  
Operating incorporates stimulating designs  
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign  
Don't lose ya mind, concentrating on how I shine  
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time  
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip

With the blues light my fuse, allow me  
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be  
My technique's superb when I'm pissing on these herbs  
Crystal clear so you can hear every word

Baby  
There is something that I want to say to you  
You've been on my mind now  
For a while and I just don't know what to do  
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt

I know  
That we've  
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past  
If you promise to hold me down  
Then our love will have a second chance to last  
I've been thinking of holding you  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt

Forget the past  
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on  
Back to back, through the ups and downs  
Right or wrongs, lay down  
Let me kiss you all down your back  
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around  
I apologize too  
For not recognizing the pain inside of you  
I never lie to you, again  
Last time had stress on my mind  
Had a hard time believing  
That my girl could be genuine  
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real  
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel  
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most  
From now on, til we give up the ghost

Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity

Servin' a Justice  
Poetic the way I last it

Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit

See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me  
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society

""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?""  
""Have some donuts and milk?""  
""Listen to a pop tune maybe?""  
  
Please be his ex and be my bride  
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried  
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there  
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair  
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole  
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role  
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby  
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me  
I cry out your name as you hold his hand  
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned  
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain  
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain  
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad  
Fantasize of the love we could have had  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I pour wine for two, even though it's just me  
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see  
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring  
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing  
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two  
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you  
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap  
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
The time has come, the decision's yours  
This super love story ain't working no more  
Can't you understand that my love spans  
Higher and further than any man's  
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth  
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout  
You're my only desire, I fight to the death  
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath  
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close  
To our love I toast, all he does is boast  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
A knock on the door and a tap on the glass  
Tells me you see it my way at last  
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me  
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""  
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore  
You want more of what you used to ignore  
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy  
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me  
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'  
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight  
But my agony continues till it reaches night  
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall  
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall  
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon  
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon  
So I dress to impress, exit the house  
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out  
In the middle of the court yard there you stand  
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction  
You won't get used if you follow my instructions  
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm  
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan  
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down  
You will find your best friend finally is found  
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white  
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight  
And tender and young, soft and wet  
It's hotter than any fantasy could get  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more

I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd  
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat  
While my JVC vibrates the concrete  
I'm sorry if you can't understand  
But I need a radio inside my hand  
Don't mean to offend other citizens  
But I kick my volume way past 10  
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough  
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush  
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show  
But I couldn't survive without my radio  
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass  
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face  
My radio's bad from the Boulevard  
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd  
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme  
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind  
Cause I play everyday, even on the subway  
I would of got a summons but I ran away  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Suckers on my jock when I walk down the block  
I really don't care if you're jealous or not  
Cause I make the songs, you sing along  
And your radio's def when my record's on  
So get off the wall, become involved  
All your radio problems have now been solved  
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond  
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm  
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in  
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin  
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back  
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac  
Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed  
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes  
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast  
The level on my power meter will not decrease  
Suckers get mad, cause the girlies scream  
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset  
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck  
Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play  
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J  
Let your big butt bounce from right to left  
Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def  
Most definitely created by me  
Goin' down in radio history  
I'm good to go on your radio  
And I'm cold gettin' paid cause Rick said so  
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch  
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis  
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'  
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'  
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock  
Circulating through your radio non-stop  
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette  
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject  
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lot of gold  
And jams like these keep me in control  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Your energy level starts to increase  
As my big beat is slowly released  
I'm on the radio and at the jam  
LL Cool J is who I am  
I'ma make ya dance, boogie down and rock  
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot  
And to expand my musical plan  
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands  
  
That's right, so don't try to front the move  
As you become motivated by the funky groove  
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block  
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock  
See people can't stop me, neither can the police  
I'm a musical maniac to say the least  
For you and your radio I made this for  
Cool J's here to devastate once more  
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs  
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!  
Here to command the hip-hop land  
Kick it live with a box inside my hand  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out,  
Cool out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at.

There's no glo-glory, for this story-story

I syncopate it and design it well-well  
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels  
All techniques are a combination  
Of skills that I have, thought narration  
  
Last year my melody, but still complete  
Providing musical energy for the street  
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect  
Jump track patt-erns on cass-ette  
Time-time snare had bass and cymbal  
Like that of a cat on the mic I'm nimble  
Ba-sic patterns, grouped and changed  
Se-quence fre-quent, seek and gain,  
Break, break, for narration  
  
Break two, break two  
  
I'm in the center of a, I'm in the center of a  
Musical skinner, some say the skins is a blow of torture  
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me  
I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry  
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands  
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll  
Give you a lift, no need to sniff  
No butts no how's no why's or if's  
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated

Increasing the rate of vibration  
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know

The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi, wealth and fame  
The total propulsion, of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes  
Have to be very acute, education level high  
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track, culminating on wax  
The tape has slack, rewind then back  
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MC's to duel  
  
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard  
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!

LL Cool J,I Need Love,/l/ll+cool+j/i+need+love_20081043.html,"When I'm alone in my room  
Sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind  
I hear my conscience call  
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove  
For the first time in my life, I see I need love  
There I was, giggling about the games  
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names  
Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn  
As I said to myself, ""Look what you've done to her""  
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels  
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal  
Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true  
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you  
Saying amore, kissing you on the ear  
Whispering ""I love you"" and ""I'll always be near""  
Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found  
A desire for true love, floating around  
Inside my soul, because my soul is cold  
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old  
But the other half, needs affection and joy  
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Romance, sheer delight, how sweet  
I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete  
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle  
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle  
Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat  
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""  
It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you  
I can go on forever telling you what I'll do  
But where you at? You're neither here nor there  
I swear, I can't find you anywhere  
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug  
This love search, is really making me bugged  
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?  
Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean  
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide  
And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you  
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you  
Grind, mold, and never be alone  
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone  
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad  
I've got money but love's something I never had  
I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all  
I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall  
I watch the sun rise, in your eyes  
We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed  
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal  
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel  
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there  
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share  
Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet  
I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer  
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger  
Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration  
This whole experience has been such a revelation  
It's taught me love, and how to be a real man  
To always be considerate and do all I can  
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much  
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch  
Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time  
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine  
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man  
I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand  
I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive  
I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive  
I'd search the whole world for that special girl  
And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Girl, listen to me.  
When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall,  
Fantasies, they go through my mind.  
And, I've come to realize that, I need true love.  
And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen.  
I'll be waiting, I love you.

Young fools get dicked, LL rules the shit  
With a platinum fist, the relentless abyss  
I take you to a land where piranhas like to kiss

Sixteen years, twenty million albums, yeah you're climbin'

Know what I'm saying sugar  
(Carl Thomas, yeah uncle L)  
(Let's go)  
  
When it's love at first sight  
It's all right to get caught up in the hype  
You got me staring at the ceiling late at night  
I got you calling up your girls for insight  
That's ai-ight cause I blazed it just right  
You got a man so I can't leave marks when I bite  
Can't go to your crib and conversate late at night  
But I know you think of me when he's holding you tight  
Wish I was there baby  
  
[Carl Thomas]  
It was love at first sight  
I know from the way she looked at me  
Her eyes said it all  
Long days and nights, we spent  
Until she dropped the bomb on me  
When she said that she  
Was unhappily married with children  
  
1 - And I wish I never met her at all  
Even though I love her so  
But she got love for me  
But she still belongs to someone else  
  
It hurts so bad, for sure  
Because she wants to be with me  
But she cannot be with me  
She chose to stay-hey at home  
So they could be a family  
For the children  
But what about me?  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Maybe in another life  
Things could be the way  
We both desired  
It's a catch-22  
(Catch-22)  
Even when you win, someone had to lose  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Ll Cool J] (Puffy)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I wanna snatch you from your man  
(That's right)  
If need be, throw some ice up on your hand  
(Come on)  
Anybody that's human will understand  
(Uh)  
No disrespect baby it's God's plan  
Your man's cool with me  
But I must take what's rightfully mine  
Even if it means I gotta cross the line  
Even if it means I got to take my time  
(Take your time)  
And send some chicks at him and disrupt his mind  
But whether he true or not  
You still hot  
(Still hot)  
At three in the morning you sit staring at the clock  
(Come on)  
Making up reasons to ride through my block  
(What?)  
I wish he'd disappear, I wish that you'd stop  
I wish that we could shop with our shorties in the drop  
(He-he)  
Cruise the clear waters in a wine colored yacht  
(I like that)  
The sun rays sparkle off your skin, so hot  
(Come on)  
It gets no better than this, we on top  
(Yeah)  
  
[Carl Thomas] (Puffy)  
Met her  
At all, at all  
Even though I love her so  
She's got love for me, oh  
(Carl Thomas, Emotions)  
But she still belongs to someone else  
(Bad Boy you know the name)  
(Sing the song)  
I wish, I wish I never met her at all, oh, oh  
(Yeah)  
I wouldn't hurt so much inside  
Oh she still belongs to someone else  
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain  
Met her at all  
If I never met her at all, at all, at all  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
She still belongs to someone else

I have more beef than filet mignon  
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the? Como?  
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week  
And go platinum next month  
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro  
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow  
I'm three from three from a three-point land  
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand  
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee  
I add verbal assault to your mental injury  
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it  
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it  
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this  
I sew up the populace like a seamstress  
A prisoner, doing time and the bit  
A grown man, and don't play with no kids

And I got to represent, Q-Boro, the thorough  
Ya know what I mean? We get down, we get down baby  
Check this shit out right here, uh  
  
E Pluribus Unum is the album I'ma drop  
It'll make you bitch niggas as hard as rocks  
Giving head to the glock, pretend it's hard cock  
Splashing niggas I came slow through the block  
I'm, the original, visual, individual  
Ten times platinum your career's looking critical  
Reach for this, mother fuck being a criminal  
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal  
You wanna freestyle fuck that  
I need at least seven figures to even touch that  
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format  
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that  
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fucking with me  
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me  
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads  
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards  
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four  
And 2001'll be mine, by law  
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?  
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standing in line  
Loving the way I shine and my lyrics combine  
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find  
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits  
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch  
Back in the days it was the M fast stick  
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick  
This ones for Clue and my Riker's Island niggas  
That remember when I came through  
The big O B C C H D M 2 C 74  
Little Nasi and the crew, y'all niggas come home  
  
Word up, the new album goin' be the shit baby

LL Cool J,It's Time For War,/l/ll+cool+j/its+time+for+war_20834491.html,"Welcome to Exit 13  
I am your host  
LL Cool J  
  
You said I was finished  
And Father Time was the blame  
You disrespected my legacy  
And threw dirt on my name  
Told DJs he's over  
He ain't spittin' the same  
What he says is irrelevant  
Hip-Hop culture has changed  
When I walk in the room  
Young boys look at me strange  
As if I am a relic  
From some long forgotten game  
It makes my blood boil  
Turns my eyes to flames  
I built an empire  
They tried to kick me out in the rain  
So I called on an inner power  
It's hard to explain  
It's like a holy spirit  
Utilizing hip hop slang  
I'm beyond the gold grills  
And logos on chains  
You see I changed rap forever  
I elevated the game  
Launched the greatest label  
In the history of rap  
And for twenty four years  
I carried it on my back  
I've always shined brighter  
When I'm under attack  
I might be down for a moment  
But I always come back  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Check it)  
It's time for war  
  
This is a resurrection  
I'm back from the dead  
They told me quit a long time ago  
But I conquered instead  
I had dreams and visions  
Swirling around in my head  
I had this hunger deep inside of me  
That has to be fed  
Hip hop will respect  
All the blood that I shed  
I have a covenant with God  
I have swallowed the bread  
Hip hop my co-defendant  
With this mic I thee wed  
I made an entire generation  
Obey what we said  
I'm talkin' France to Germany  
From Italy to Japan  
From London to Belgium  
To Afghanistan  
From Farmers Boulevard  
Smokin' a blunt with my man  
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board  
To build Def Jam  
You see, I'm the undisputed  
King of all hip hop  
Everything after is my legacy  
Like it or not  
And I will keep making history  
I can't stop  
LL Cool J  
Eternally hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how easily I flipped it  
And switched the style around  
Competition losin' their footing  
I see them falling down  
They will plot against me  
It kills them because I'm ballin' now  
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone  
But I got you callin' now  
This is a job that must get done  
Even if I become public enemy number one  
If I had to pick up an Uzi  
That weighs over a ton  
I will attack hip hop  
Until competition is none  
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L  
You end up tortured  
And trapped in psychological hell  
And this is the beginning  
Of a new era in rap  
LL Cool J, feel the impact  
It's okay if you call it a comeback  
And let them know  
I'm ready for combat  
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back  
The crown looks wrong on your head  
I want that

In on me, feelin' like time's frozen  
Fadin' in and out, noddin' and dozin'  
Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion  
What I did to you was wrong I admit it  
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through  
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you  
Talkin' slick like she ain't here  
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click  
I need to hit her with a brick  
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament  
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge  
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin' rain  
Whylin' out screamin' yo' name  
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell 'til you mad as hell  
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)  
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them  
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)  
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere  
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha  
To show you I changed shawty  
  
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat  
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat  
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that  
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?  
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin'  
Every other weekend gone until the mornin'  
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong  
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on  
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings  
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn  
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights  
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck  
That was the old me, the one I still regret  
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(i still love you!) [cars peel]  
  
I don't care if the cops got me surrounded  
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in  
My mind's in an altered state  
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake  
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes  
I already played the fool when I let you escape  
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex  
Everything about you and yours connects  
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin  
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'  
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'  
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'  
Please find it in your heart to forgive me  
Realize only god can convict me  
We all make mistakes, so have you  
If god show mercy on me, then you should too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty

My ace in the hole was this brand new track  
I'ma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up  
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up  
I did it, but the devil didn't make me  
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me  
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint  
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint  
Your head with oil--lots of oil  
Make it run like water, watch it boil  
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it  
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---huh!  
Prince of the growl is on the prowl  
How you like me now punk? You living foul  
Here's what my game is, here is what my aim is  
A washed up rapper needs a washer, my name is--

Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper  
King Hercules!  
  
Back for the payback, I must say that  
I heard your new jam, I don't play that  
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting  
This year you tried, next year you're quitting  
Last year you thought I was dying out  
But again, and again, and again without a doubt  
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound  
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around  
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff  
And this is an example of funky stuff  
When you want to make hits, you make 'em like this  
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss  
It's a strong record, a record for the strong  
For those who appreciate real rap songs  
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track  
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--

Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth  
A-k-a James Todd Smith  
Hard like penitentiary steel  
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal

Home girls in the house, give it up  
You gotta want to get hotter  
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot of  
People don't know how nice I am  
People sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man  
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran  
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van  
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves  
Don't run out there ? ? ?  
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do  
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--

I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier  
Check out the way I say my, display my, play my  
Ain't holding back, behind the cool without the A.Y.  
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth  
It makes me move and I'll improve  
As it goes on, as it flows on  
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on  
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown  
Pull on my jock to be down  
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down  
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down  
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees  
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LPs  
Day after day after day  
Tou smashed in the face by the vase of Cool J  
I'm--[scratches]  
  
I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker  
A killing machine, a savage street talker

To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed  
The prince of hip hop, straight from Queens  
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean  
And you've never seen anybody rock the party  
All you punks ? ? ? this beats Bacardi

Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano  
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel

Swing a hook, got the vertebrae, be brave  
Heat gain meltin' on my heatwave  
Power to the crowd, pandemonium  
Showin' 'em how I gets down  
  
[Chorus]  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
  
Triggedy, sky-high like a kite  
God diggity, every other cloud's blue  
Puff on a, yeah, puff on a  
Bring it on, off, on, baby, one-two  
Peep in the arena, death at your doorstep  
Right around the corner is the land of regret  
When ya sweat to get down, sweat to get off and on  
Till the, nothin' normal 'bout my songs  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
LL Cool, J jazzy jewel  
Takin' dime pieces to the real school  
I got 'em on nations, buckin' like fools  
Pitbulls fightin' over streets I rule  
Catch it if you can, when it's hot ta hit'cha hand  
Throw ya skunks in the air, my funk got the flair, man  
I can do division, baby, I can do math  
Multiplying fractions, now ya know the half  
Knuckle games played, must pack steel  
Oh yes, I'm livin' like real  
To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle  
Till the death of my foes, it's my show

[Verse:]  
This is hard to say I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way  
'cause lately I been busy a lot  
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not  
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly  
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes  
Now I talk real foul and slick  
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""  
Back in the days I was your number one pick  
Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix  
I had to dig deep inside myself  
'cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else  
It's a long journey back to the place we was  
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love  
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up  
I can't let us self-destruct

Baby smile today  
'cause I been imaginin' more ways  
I'm gon' love you better  
When your friends'll see you too  
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do  
I'm gon' love you better  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I think about the things we did  
And I think about you having my kids  
And I think about us sharing a crib  
Losin' all that, God forbid  
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things  
In addition to the sl's, baguettes and rings  
Instead I walk around like I'm a king  
And having you ain't nothing but a thing  
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good  
Too busy frontin' in the hood Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go  
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow One more chance baby and don't say
no  
'cause I got another side to show  
Some say love is painful it helps you grow Well it's time for the pain to go,
ya'know

It's a brand new me, a brand new you  
A brand new day, sky so blue  
Hold my hand while I walk with you  
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you  
No more games callin' you foul names Actin' like females is all the same  
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed  
From this day forward I'll never be the same  
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams I love you, lemme show you what I
mean Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen Watch you sleep, so peaceful
and serene  
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life  
But this time I'ma do it right  
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart  
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

I've been here for years  
I'm rocking my peers  
Puttin' suckers in fear  
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon  
Listen to the bass go boom  
Explosions, overpowerin'  
Over the competition I'm towerin'  
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics  
That'll make you call the cops  
Don't you dare stare, you better move  
Don't ever compare  
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced  
Competition's payin' the price  
  
I'm gonna knock you out

I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out

I'm gonna knock you out

Don't you call this a regular jam  
I'm gonna rock this land  
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm  
And I'm just gettin' warm  
Just like Muhammed Ali  
They called him Cassius  
Watch me bash this beat like a skull  
That you know I've beef with  
Why do you riff with me  
The maniac psycho  
And when I pull out my jammy get ready  
Cause I might go Blaw!  
How you like me now?  
The Ripple will not allow  
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,  
Listen to my gears shift  
I'm blasting, I'm blasting  
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting  
Olde English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH  
I just don't know  
What made you forget that I was raw  
But now I gotta new tour  
I'm going insane  
Startin' the hurricane  
Releasin' pain  
Lettin' you know  
You can't gain or maintain  
Unless you say my name  
Rippin'  
Killin'  
Diggin' and drillin' a hole  
Pass the Old Gold  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shotgun blasts are heard  
When I rip and kill at will  
The man of the hour, tower of power  
I'll devour  
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand  
That I'm not your average man  
When I gotta jammy in my hand  
Damn!  
Oh!  
Listen to the way I slay  
Your crew

Damage  
Destruction, terror, and mayhem  
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him

Get down  
Don't you never, ever  
Pull my lever  
Cause I explode  
And my nine is easy to load  
I gotta thank God  
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard

You know, that I know that you love me  
So if you just give me a change  
I can still show you romance  
I know, that you still savor for my flavor baby

Milky cereal

Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Who's the baddest female of them all?  
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl  
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul  
Rich female, very debonair  
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair  
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo  
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's  
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle  
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles  
A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute.""  
I said, ""I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop.""  
Me and Frosted went to get a drink  
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think  
She ordered potassium, calcium  
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium  
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch

I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm  
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm  
For some reason, we walked in the rain  
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain  
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real  
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal  
So we went to be alone  
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home  
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms  
I said ""Forget it, let me see your lucky charms.""  
When we began, her hairstyle was neat  
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat  
Talked about marriage, I said ""That's risky  
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies""  
She had a robe with the velour material  
Her pops woke up, I said ""Hello Mr. Cereal  
I came this morning to deliver the paper.""  
He said ""Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors  
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'  
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in.""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, check this out here  
  
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough  
She was turnin' tricks to get her ""coo-coo puff!""  
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact  
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat  
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks  
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks  
We called him Hungry Jack  
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack  
He invited me out to lunch  
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch  
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""  
He said ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""  
He said ""Cool,"" came back with the order  
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter.""  
He said ""Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?""  
I said ""Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes  
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing  
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King.""  
He said ""Go party, do some minglin'  
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'""  
I said ""It's smooth, no disrespect  
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque.""  
Then we walked down the aisle  
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  
  
You know what I'm sayin'?

Right here baby  
  
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale  
About a mogul named Uncle L  
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision  
(He excels, they all fail)  
Undisputed, the game got so polluted  
That he turned his 'Radio' off  
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again  
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)  
With a leopard print outfit on  
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on  
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')  
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'  
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact  
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ  
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'  
""Exotic Motorcars,"" we want a deal on that  
  
[Chorus]  
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)  
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)  
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)  
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)  
  
'Around the way girls be doin' it well'  
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)  
On the Money magazine covers  
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers  
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche  
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)  
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him  
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him  
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'  
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)  
I been his biggest fan since five years old  
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)  
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that  
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that  
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back  
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences  
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me  
  
'Hey Lover', I'm 'Loungin'  
'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain  
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'  
'(Four)-to-the-Three-Two-One', he stopped countin'  
Eliminated competition quickly  
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be  
He feel his flow deep down in your artery  
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be  
'6 Minutes of Pleasure' for 'Jack the Ripper'  
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)  
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'  
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?  
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars  
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)  
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite  
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it

Yeah, ten, faith, power of God  
Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby  
Work with me ma, uh, it's been too long, ten

Once I live a life of a millionaire  
Still do!  
Spending my money, honey ohh I didn't care  
Still don't!  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I'm a floss 'til I die, ball never fall  
Cop 'til I drop, Motherfuck 'em all  
Count paper schemin, leanin on the wall  
Money comin fast, niggas ridin balls  
I been to hell and back, I seen what you saw  
6 in the mornin, D's at the door  
I was a shorty on a bike, hangin with Alpo  
I was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter  
I was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2  
My man az he really schooled me  
My man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V  
I messed up the count, Kev winked at me  
What I learned is niggas need paper to burn  
And you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up  
You can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck  
Sometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up  
Follow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up  
I used to be in Queens with my man Black Just  
Before he got killed, now that nigga was real  
He took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live  
Took me to hot blocks, showed me big knots  
Him and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not  
You ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly  
Used to run to Big Kev before he got knocked  
When niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block  
125th in the Beemer with az  
He gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me  
That being a gangster don't mean you're all bad  
And niggas respect you when they know you got cash  
Remember Big dave had the dust on smash  
I was amazed the lifestyle was so fast  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'  
That was before Queens had blood in the street  
Stretch from bk had the pretty gold Benz  
He took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends  
Let me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend  
They was playing the money game and I wanted in  
I was just a young boy with dangerous friends  
If it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been  
I took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts  
Big Chuck when to jail when I was ready to start  
I guess I was destin, God pulled us apart  
But I admit, getting that street money is a art  
I was so many players I knew back in the D  
Like Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami  
'86 that nigga's Benz had tv's  
Only God knows what these niggas mean to me  
Real talk

Trying to pull you down  
But what you have to remember is  
It's up to you, it's your choice  
You only get one shot in life  
And you only get one shot at love  
  
Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love  
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match  
Everything is perfect, it seems divine  
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch  
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside  
One person smirks while the other one cries  
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love  
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Physical and mental, those are two different loves  
Physical's a moment, mental is forever  
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden  
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together  
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times  
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow  
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love  
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow

Jealousy, don't let it interfere  
Don't let it come in between  
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God  
So merciless and mean  
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships  
And pit two people against, one another  
And because of this God, the one you love so much  
Will no longer be your lover

That's all  
  
I hope you understand what I just said  
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life  
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it  
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad  
Take it from me  
You only get one shot, and I mean that  
One shot

Said her man get paper but he don't live right  
All these emotions flowing inside the club  
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?

Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'

Moanin' in the mirror with my Cubans on  
Let bygones be bygones, no more games  
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames  
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back  
Got it all figured out, mami I like that  
Collect tips, cop his and her whips

Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

So why try to deny what ya already know ya love  
Up above  
Cause the mania  
Hysteria  
In the streets

She gave me that feeling  
That sunshine bring in.

The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul  
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll  
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen  
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream  
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense  
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince  
Rock the bells  
  
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time  
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind  
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots  
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop  
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn  
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn  
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned  
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn  
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze  
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J.  
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells  
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well  
Rock the bells

They pack guns, but I stack funds

You ran the wrong way, now you livin' on the run

Coughed up a lung, became my son  
Flames I brung, platinumn weighs a ton  
Heavy on the chest, I pitty all the rest  
I put 'em to the test  
I spit it like I'm blessed

Creep wit' my CD, don't let 'em know you buy that  
One in the snips, one in the whip with the low jack  
Call a 911 to get the LL back  
Original bells, LL  
Rocked them till they fell  
Competition bailed  
Looked like mince green when mic had 'em swelled  
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell

And in the meanwhile, I throw my baby in Chanelle

Layin' low to catch you on stage so I can run on

Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya knee-deep  
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat  
Even if you walkin', wit' ya walkman in the street  
Actin' gassed up, but you really on need  
How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED?  
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up  
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up  
Put the L down, picked the other LL up  
Maybe we can straighten this out before it's toe-up  
Watch me closely, boom! I'm a blow-up  
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin' dough up

Gucci shoes, that's how I play  
  
Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps  
I was taught early on don't jeopardize the stacks  
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts  
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks  
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats  
To end up, crawlin' out of a hole in Iraq  
Try to topple my regime  
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen  
Is there a medic on the scene?  
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin'  
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in  
Slow down baby, you actin' like a clown homes  
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone  
You hear my heat rock comin' through your sheetrock  
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox  
I get my swagger on, proud as a peacock  
Bars is hot, beats is pumpin' like a ? box

Shake it baby shake it  
If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Young ladies in the spot, if you came up in the place to rock, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby  
  
They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow  
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow  
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos  
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin' hollows  
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision  
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision  
It seems like greed's the world religion  
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons  
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes  
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die  
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers  
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years  
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be or not to be the man, that's the question  
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined  
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it  
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded  
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm  
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed  
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect  
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real  
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible

Yellow canary tennis on the neck  
Three quarter black mink  
Gucci hat to the side, shades  
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans  
Black Phantom, oak wood

You do it for the gangsters

Rip a nigga from the East to the West

That's slammin' through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back

For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back  
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm

Come on and dance with me baby  
Take it off,  
There ain't nobody who can fade me  
Take it off,  
I'm on a hot-streak lately  
Take it off,  
You know that ass look crazy  
Take it off,  
You saw me up in that Mercedes  
Take it off,  
I know my crew look shady  
Take it off,  
You see me spendin' dubs baby  
Take it off,  
Watch me dance for you baby  
  
Wo day drive is live, Monte Carlo was ill  
Convertible limousines, def jam got the bill  
Remember R. Kelly had the house on the hill  
Well when the partys over we can go there and chill  
In London it's Big Ben style breakfast in bed  
In Paris you were on an Eifel Tower givin' me head  
Go to Switzerland, private jets over the house  
Come home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch  
Real niggas, nothin' but the platinum shit  
Keep that ass soakin wet, plus I'm spendin' his chips  
Who's fuckin' wit that, put your middle finger in the air  
Has a jet passion X-man playin' wit your hair  
  
[Chorus]  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
  
To my man Black Jus baby RIP  
Accessory to the crime is the prime dogg three  
When we get the money baby, spreadin' the cream  
To tell your brother Joe to hold it down for Queens  
And to my cousin Will, hold ya head nigga chill  
J.T. Damon in the car let's get the squeals  
My nigga Big Bonny Puff, glad your home  
Rock the bells Melly Mell, Jimmy Love and Tone  
Baby we live cats, lookin' at where in we rides at  
Drug walls, hip-hop beats, how 'bout that  
The rest fell so far, they can't climb back  
Let's take it to the video-tape, rewind that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Take it off, greatest of all times.

Yeah alright  
But we need a beat that they can front to  
Oh, that'll work  
Be funky  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)  
(Cars ride by)  
  
Funky  
For all the cars out there  
And all the brothers  
That like to front in their rides  
Check it out  
  
You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say  
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay  
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around  
12 o'clock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots  
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots  
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they don't understand why I act this way  
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day  
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently  
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock  
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming  
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling  
A right-hand man's here without the swing  
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow  
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n  
That means I'm chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a base-head would say I want bass  
I want a hit, I want a dose  
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk  
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what I'm saying  
Word  
So next time you're in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
It's Cool  
  
Peace

LL Cool J,The Breakthrough,/l/ll+cool+j/the+breakthrough_20081048.html,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around  
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand  
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?  
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies, records, goin' on tour  
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  
It's harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when you're rich you got friends  
But when you're poor you're alone  
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife""  
Every day is a chase, every day is a race  
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young  
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  
Not that I killed him, it's just  
He didn't want to trust  
The words of a master that's why you must  
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear  
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone""  
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks  
Straight up and down, no special effects  
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give  
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  
Here I am, tellin' the truth  
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  
All you petty MC's in the state of New York  
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer  
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire  
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  
L.L. Cool J, the baddest around.

Yeah, yeah  
Yeah  
We'll get into the groove  
Power of God move  
Something real smooth  
Something you need to take heed to  
  
A base-head cleaned up his act  
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back  
Decided, he could find a much better way to live  
You know the way, positive  
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs  
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs  
Never before was a man so far behind  
And came back to rule for a long time  
Positive will explode when you light me  
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly  
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred  
When they felt the power of God  
  
Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came  
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain  
He doesn't understand the power of a ?  
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team  
Avenging angels will come and burn  
All those who saw, but refused to learn  
He has no color, no shape, and no form  
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm  
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard  
You can feel the power of God  
  
Money is small and the soul stands tall  
All those who don't realize this, fall  
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool  
And it's cool to be in school  
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift  
Your mind is a gift  
You're somebody, whether you know it or not  
Outside the weather is hot  
People walk around with their minds in a daze  
Never take the time to stop and give praise  
You're lucky to live in this world  
Even the starving boys and girls  
Cause life is a gift in itself  
And only certain people are blessed with good health  
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd  
I can feel the power of God  
  
You know I'm sayin  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Yeah  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
The power of God  
Yeah  
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em  
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em  
Shape em, and make em take form  
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm  
Harmless and innocent  
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant  
This mentality gotta be erased by faith  
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th  
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge  
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college  
It's not about being black or white  
It's about everybody being a right  
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard  
He felt the power of God  
  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Power of god  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
That was just a word to the wise  
Up rise  
Cause we definitely gotta unify  
And we need unity in times like these  
We got to stick together  
Cause we as a people  
All people  
Gotta make it to the promised land

He will make a way, yes he will  
Yes, he will  
  
Oh, I do believe that we will make it  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Uh uh  
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems  
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton  
Stress beamin' down like the sun I felt rotten  
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin'  
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him  
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up  
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders  
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya  
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar  
I tried to told ya, he he he  
Enemies gunnin', true believers ain't runnin'  
Or duckin', we ain't scared of nothin', ya feel me?  
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?  
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh  
Yeah, uh, check it out  
There's a living power, make a man out a coward  
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers  
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured  
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters  
Time to shout it, sing it louder  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, we're gonna make it  
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)  
Thank God we made it (yeah)  
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
I was feelin' like my whole world was spinnin' and spillin'  
On the ground and that God wasn't willin'  
It seemed like the only ones ballin' was the villains  
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chillin'  
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em  
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim  
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em  
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'  
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning  
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'  
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up  
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up  
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up  
Get your life lined up before time's up  
Yo, yo, you know what?  
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack  
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back  
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that  
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back  
Uh, yeah, sing it out now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley  
Never give up, press on through the storm  
Weepin' man fall, for the night seem long  
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'  
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah  
I know it feels like your back's to the wall  
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call  
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin' off  
But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost  
Stay on your course, carry your cross  
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'  
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it  
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits  
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks  
And I'm not finished, man listen  
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus  
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces  
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us  
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors  
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We made it, we made it  
Through the storm and rain, yeah  
You can make it, yes you can  
You can make it, you got me  
I know you can, I know you can  
I know you can, yes, yeah  
I do believe we'll make it (Hallelujah!)

He ruled the world, I was in the front row  
Run-D. M. C. Showed me what I wanna be  
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee  
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three

LL Cool J,You Can't Dance,/l/ll+cool+j/you+cant+dance_20081115.html,"He man, I've seen ya,  
Think ya rockin' it on the floor,  
You look like a moron!  
Who let you in the door?  
To put the question bluntly  
Maybe your feet's deformed.  
They should slap you in the teeth  
When you put your dancing shoes on.  
You can't dance!  
  
Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?  
Homeboy, what's the use?  
Anytime you wanna step aside a party,  
First think of an excuse.  
You dance like a fat old lady  
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,  
But every time you try to get one move right.  
The old lady then did it twice.  
You can't dance!  
  
You've been a dancing disco disaster,  
The worst I ever saw.  
They should dropkick you on the neck  
And drag you off the floor.  
In every discotheque, I see you there  
In the middle of the crowd,  
Looking like you got eight or nine  
Left feet dragging all around.  
You can't dance!  
  
Take my advice, don't move!  
You'll never get the knack.  
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party  
And wouldn't be coming back.  
On the floor you're a dinosaur,  
Yeah boy, that's how you move.  
You look like Ralph Cramden or a Donald Duck cartoon.  
You can't dance!  
  
You wanna come to my party?  
I wouldn't give you a chance.  
You tried to take break-dance lessons,  
Ended up in an ambulance.  
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?  
You dance like you got arthritis already,  
What'll happen when you get old?  
You can't dance!  
  
Why are you so stiff?  
Is it something that your mother did?  
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people  
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid.  
You live in a ""can't dance"" house,  
Went out in a ""can't dance"" car,  
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father  
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar.  
You take a ""can't dance"" bath,  
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne.  
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party  
So you wouldn't have to ""can't dance"" all alone.  
You can't dance!  
  
Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?

LL Cool J,You'll Rock,/l/ll+cool+j/youll+rock_20352694.html,"The momentum of this party can only increase  
The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece  
You'll want to kick steps to the musical feast  
And witness the force I'm about to release  
You'll rock!  
  
I'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs  
In case you're unaware my beats are always strong  
I'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you  
with one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through  
I'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J  
I'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say  
Experienced, rhyme skilled, plus my voice isn't waxed  
Funky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts  
I'll dust a rapper off if I require practice  
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus  
Choreographer of rhymes, best of all times  
Composition technician with the be -boy's mind  
Terrorizin' emcee's instructions in my path  
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph  
I'm the mic dominater, best of all times  
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'ma tell you the mean behind the scratchin' sounds  
He's Cut-Creator, Philly-Philly as the DJ crown  
Me and him are imitatin' but never underatin'  
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated  
The mission ain't complete without the use of his hands  
He makes my rhymes so fresher, my beat expands  
So I'll like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him  
A Five Man Crew, me and him will defeat them  
He'll scratch and wipe out all foes  
Turntable terrorizin' and I think you should know  
That were, high calibered and my names' J  
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day  
To ring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer  
I have to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player  
Materials royal, I'm a'nating all  
Like brown with dimples and I'm six-feet tall  
And promoter of recordings that I call my own  
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home  
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears  
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare  
Emcee, a sucker natter and I just won't stop  
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock  
I'm a lyrical game on the heels of fame  
And the world is glad that Cool J came  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street  
You think about it everytime that you hear this beat  
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard  
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard  
See I'm loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal  
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel  
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J  
In the center of it all is a cute 3-A  
Forty-seven will surrender till emcee's in fear  
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here  
Quick as L's on my face I will hold my space  
And to taste, stimulate, and conduct the bait  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission  
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician  
Jammin' up the board at the rappin' commission  
Soul inventor of this composition  
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could  
Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldn't write this good  
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army  
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me  
Super bad, cold-crushed, number one be -boy  
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy  
Crown-Prince of rappin', Godfather of bees  
Emcee's that need a new lady to feed  
You'll rock!  
  
You know I'm sayin'? Break!  
You know I'm sayin'? Break! Break! Break two!

LL Cool J,You're In My Heart,/l/ll+cool+j/youre+in+my+heart_20627582.html,"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love  
The way it felt, the way it feels  
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart  
I love you for real  
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat  
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still  
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em  
Oh what a thrill!  
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true  
They came strolling along  
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart  
I swear, I'll never do you wrong  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Nothing in the world could separate the two  
And even though you've only known that person for a short time  
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart  
  
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK  
You're too young to be so serious  
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you  
And walk away aggravated and furious  
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter  
The relationship's yours  
You feel you're maturing, and hey,  
You can fight your own battles and wars  
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them  
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm  
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging  
And keeping each other warm  
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love  
Believe me, it ain't a easy task  
We'd have one argument too many  
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?  
  
Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart  
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what  
You run out the door, I tell you come back  
I love you, you shout out, so what?  
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me  
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?  
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain  
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right  
And held you tight, every night  
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?  
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me  
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you  
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart  
That's right I admit it  
  
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go  
I struggle and fight for you against all odds  
Get down on my knees, and pray to God  
That our love is in the cards  
Cause I know you're right for me  
And I know I'm right for you  
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands  
People say forget about it, move on  
But see they don't understand  
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me  
So much in fact that I'd give my life  
To stare into your eyes and caress your face  
As the priest, announces us man and wife  
We'd live happily, ever after  
White picket fence and the whole nine yards  
And anything that anybody said  
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart  
  
So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind  
I'm begging you baby please come back home  
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed  
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones  
This can't be true, I'm losing you  
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright  
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight  
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried  
Now it's up to you baby, please understand  
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything  
Just let me take ya by the hand  
And lead ya, baby I got ya  
Protect you like a mother, protects a child  
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while  
You're my heart

A brand new friend  
  
Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
You could do anything you wanted to  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
No, just something that I can hold down  
'Cause it's all downhill now  
  
So let me count the times that we swore and lied that we'd  
Tie ourself to the railway line  
Let me count the times when of course we lied  
Well we knew no better, it was no crime  
Let me count the times  
  
I, well I don't know when I, when I'll be content  
But I do know I need a brand new friend

Lloyd Cole,Butterfly,/l/lloyd+cole/butterfly_20084685.html,"You were an innocent child before I laid my hands on you  
And all that pain that you held inside  
Was just waiting to bloom in a darkened room  
And you just flew right into the light and came alive  
My little butterfly  
  
Well you'd never known love and you'd never known pain  
But you found out that they were just like wine and champagne  
You could drink a little more, then you hurt a little less  
And you get that butterfly feeling underneath your dress  
And your promises will turn into lies  
Then you will fly  
My little butterfly  
  
Now I'm lying here babe on your side of the bed  
And I've got unclean thoughts flying through my head  
And I'm thinking about love, yes I'm thinking about pain  
And I'm thinking about some way that I might feel good again  
Yes I'm thinking about my little butterfly

Lloyd Cole,Can't Get Arrested,/l/lloyd+cole/cant+get+arrested_20084673.html,"You've been talking in circles now for years man  
Lesson number one is change your attitude  
People would like to help you  
  
All you ever wanted was a picture with the queen  
Ah, welcome to london  
When you've arrived, well you stay or you leave  
Don't you know you're quite certain  
Nothing is so pretty as it used to be, no indeed  
  
Could you entertain us with a song  
With a very special melody  
We could sing along  
And you know you should be grateful  
But I let it pass  
'Cause you can't get arrested  
But you could kiss my ass  
In hollywood, yeah yeah, doo doo doo  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
You've been talking in circles now for years man  
Is your foot nailed to the floor or do you like it here  
People would like to get to know you  
  
All you ever wanted was a picture with the queen  
Ah, welcome to london  
When you've arrived, well you stay or you leave  
Don't you know you're quite certain  
If you decide boy you'll stay on your leash well  
We'll reward you quite handsome  
When you've arrived, well you stay or you leave  
Don't you know you're quite certain  
Nothing is so pretty as it used to be, no indeed  
  
Could you entertain us with a song  
With a very special melody  
We could sing along  
Well you know you should be grateful  
But I let it pass  
'Cause you can't get arrested  
You could kiss my ass  
  
You know my first instinct's  
To kick you now you're down  
And you come waltzing in  
Think that you could push me around  
Well you know you should be grateful  
Should I let it pass  
'Cause you can't get arrested  
But you could kiss my ass  
In hollywood, doo doo, doo doo  
Doo doo, doo doo doo-

Lloyd Cole,Charlotte Street,/l/lloyd+cole/charlotte+street_20084747.html,"I was looking for a rhyme for the new york times  
When I sensed I was not alone  
She said d'you know how to spell audaciously  
I could tell I was in luck  
And so I forced a smile contrary to my style  
And she looked into my eyes  
She said d'you want to go heaven  
Or would you rather not be saved  
Here comes my train  
I'm on my way, will you not see  
I don't need your sympathy  
I won't read your poetry, oh sweetness please  
So she took me back to her basement flat  
Which was down on charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention  
We were not intense, not least because  
Well if you must just take then I'm a piece of cake  
That is what she said to me  
And so I gave myself to her charity  
Well at least that's how it seemed  
Here comes my train  
I'm on my way, what got into me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I won't read your poetry, oh bittersweets  
I was looking for a rhyme for the new times when I was distracted  
Yes those were precious times together that we wasted  
Now I'm working hard for my union card  
I must believe in charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention to stay so long  
So long
