And it's truth IMd give anything to hold  
Tonight, tonight I stay  
But you, you slip away

As fast as you can run

You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low

Let him die if he wants to?

And there's something that tears me inside, so I can't  
Go brother are you there?

Or were you hoping to find something a little more?  
Climbing down the hours I need to know now

""You're gonna die here""  
  
When will we all, awake up out this dream  
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings  
Man acting as if he was the supreme being  
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and  
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow  
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars  
Politicians, modern day magicians  
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health  
Who making us ill, they making us kill  
That's making me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)  
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled  
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel  
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal  
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed  
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED  
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!  
  
""Can't be heard clearly""  
""You're gonna die here""  
  
Operation Anaconda, ask yourself  
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?  
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price  
For his life and his wife plead twice?  
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton  
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers  
They got they answer for ransom  
As we read together, as we dream together  
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better  
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you  
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you  
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin'  
I'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen  
Now eat nigga!

Outkast,What About Your Friends (Extended Remix),/o/outkast/what+about+your+friends+extended+remix_20676888.html,"What about your friends  
What about  
What about your friends  
What about what about  
  
Every now and then I get a little crazy  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy  
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me (yeah)  
  
People try to say I act a little funny  
But that's just a figure of speech to me  
They tell me I changed because I got money  
But if you were there before then you're still down with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What about your friends will they stand their ground  
Will they let you down again  
What about your friends are they gonna be low down  
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you  
  
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Every now and then I get a little easy  
I let a lot of people depend on me  
I never though they would ever deceive me  
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own  
I'll never let another get that close to me  
You see I've grown a lot smarter now  
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see  
If your friend is true they'll be there with you  
Through the thick and thin  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Friends...  
Let you down again....  
Be low down...  
  
Forget giggly boogly  
I'm attack it like a seizure  
I got rhymes at my leisure  
Time when I need ta  
With T to the L to the C  
What I be sayin'  
Gettin' loose on this track  
But underground is where I'm stayin'  
So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in  
On a friend like the oj  
But what about your friends to the end  
Will they run on out like a jeeble  
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side  
Like a big bunch of fiends  
Six now the groupies drinkin' water  
I get real funny so you'd better hide your daughter  
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine  
Stayin' close like ketchup  
A virgin that's right you call me Bruce Lee right  
For the styles that me kick  
And give me enough respect for this funky remix  
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz  
Now the rabbit felt blue so I gave the nigga Trix  
Cuz I was his friend wasn't down for the beggin'  
You called me a friend we're seven about to takin'  
Take a tickin' keep on lickin' why you dippin' for the border  
You said you'd be down for richer for poorer but  
O-you-T-K-A-S-T ain't no change so tlc go head and sang baby  
  
Yo is it me  
L to the E-F-T-E-Y-E (a ha ha)  
Or can it be I am a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Brrrrr..... Ba ba ba  
Back up  
This ya wicked remix  
Come down wicked sing  
Rewind with em aya  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
People say I act a little funny  
I wouldn't change not for no money  
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah)  
Even though I might seem easy  
It don't give you no cause to deceive me...

With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants  
We finna enhance your brain, check it out  
Once upon a time not long ago  
When the player from the Pointe didn't have no flow  
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the sto'  
Caught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'  
Just like carbon, cause I got the heat in my rhythm  
Momma nay not, never bragging just to stay knot  
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson  
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions  
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope  
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope  
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine  
Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow  
But so is cod liver oil  
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl  
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil  
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
  
It took your momma nine months to make it  
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it  
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely  
Don't want no AIDS, no claps, or no rabies  
Yo, we take no shit, like, stopped up commodes  
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks  
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle  
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'  
But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve  
Trying to take you other people for your rims at the curb  
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head  
More head for me, while you ride to the beat  
Drop, like Tears, like For Fears, you know  
Shout Shout let it all out, just for my peers  
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind  
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Okay, like this, yeah yeah  
One time for my boy doing King shit  
Two times for Legit and it don't quit  
Three times for my folks in the drop top  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop  
One time for my cause doing Queen things  
Dead fresh to the teeth eating chicken wings  
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop

And everybody puts me down.  
I guess I'll come around,

Tell me, what's a man to do,  
To get close to you.  
I'm just a lonely fool,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Don't tell me ""no"" this time,  
If you do, it'll blow my mind.  
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?  
It's an awful thing.  
  
I guess it's time to say goodbye,  
But I've gotta give it one more try.  
I'm only satisfied,

And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars  
I don't believe there's any future in cause

Killing just to live  
  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
Killing for a living, killing just to live  
  
I looked across the answers, though questions didn't exist  
And found that I was never alone  
We cut away the cancer and continued to resist  
But the outcome of the night remained unknown  
The next thing I remember were the years across my face  
And they matched only the beauty of scars  
The next was 'cross the universe into time and space  
And to know together, we'd have to go too far  
  
Bleeding a nation, casualty time  
Breaking the back of the core  
Promised salvation, a casual crime  
Feeding and fucking the whore  
Make my living on borrowed time  
I make the clock stand still  
Keep my hands 'round what is mine  
Living just to kill  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
  
C'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your best  
C'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to rest  
I can give you reasons, 2-5 to the bone  
They can give you all you ever wanted  
When you're far away from home  
C'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your best  
C'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to rest  
  
So as the plot will thicken and time is not a friend  
The blessing comes but one in a life  
Across the crowded universe that hastens to an end  
Through memories of one time in a night  
And what will I remember through the by and by  
To have and hold and turn about the chill  
That this was not the pause to die  
But to live to kill

Just to discover life where we all are

Oh, oh but I made it alive  
The sun's startin' to rise  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive

And sincerely, I love your dearly,  
Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander

Sweep me away from you

Whenever we leave the ground  
And take to the sky

Stormy nights re-awake the stomachache that I?ve acquired  
From feeling down, things look grim and I?m so sick, of being tired  
Apartment lights go dark, and it?s depressing but what can I do?  
Midnight streets feel dead, when I am so used to driving with you  
Brighter lights fill the nights and bluer skies reflect in your eyes  
As I inspect and analyze all these dreams I don?t recognize  
If you?re still up when the ships in the port, prepare to set sail  
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail  
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?  
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you  
Count the stars, watch the waves, absorb the summer sun and think of me  
When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea  
Can you still hear my voice when I?m outside from over the phone?  
For what its worth darling dear, I wish you were here ?cause I feel alone  
When you were home, wed sing but since you?ve left I don?t hear anything  
And though I feel so sad I can?t believe things are really that bad  
Old captains and brand new cruise ships  
Sailing over the briny sea  
When I crash my beloved desk job  
And swim through the debris  
I?ll cut loose and leave this madhouse  
Bound for the Atlantic blue  
I?ll stroll down your tree-lined driveway  
And sail the ocean with you

Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track (so I stay on track)

Arise and parade around my cluttered desk

Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque  
Like mountains in the Midwest

And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale  
The structures begin to take their shape  
Before I've designed the public monorail  
The turnpike and high-speed motorway  
Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets  
The airport, the broad suspension bridge  
The lake and the beach, where several rivers meet  
Compounded from the spreadsheet

Like cold lemonade  
And both got stomach aches  
Sprawled out in the shade

And then, when the empress run aground,

I heard a gorgeous sound,  
And that's when it became a dream,  
When the sky fell in,  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea.  
I wrenched the engines off,  
And dragged them down,  
The depths turned the iron soft,  
As they swiftly drowned,  
And I brought the ocean side,  
To its rusty knees,  
  
As I felt the even tide,  
Deep in my shallow dreams.

Today I'm busting out,  
Of this old haunted house,

Owl City,Rainbow Veins,/o/owl+city/rainbow+veins_20739619.html,"High rise, veins of the avenue  
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue  
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you  
  
Street lights glisten on the boulevard  
And cold nights make staying alert so hard  
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard  
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay  
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?  
  
Small town hearts of the New Year  
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear  
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier  
  
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat  
With new taste for speed, out on the street  
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet  
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow  
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known  
That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone  
  
Your nerves gather with the altitude  
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued  
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood  
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway  
The high tide could take me so far away  
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day  
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age  
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align  
  
We were the crashing whitecaps  
On the ocean  
And what lovely seaside holiday, away  
A palm tree in Christmas lights  
My emotion  
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone  
As we spent the day alone  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known

She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me

Cause the father she loved left and never looked back  
No longer the hero, she counted on  
He told her he loved her and then he was gone  
  
[Verse 1]  
She tried to look happy in front of her friends  
But knew that she'd never feel normal again  
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes  
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked  
But nobody knew he was dying inside  
He promised his family he'd be all right  
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end

He abandonned his daughter and never returned  
And over the years though the pain was real  
She finally forgave him, and started to heal

The future's a mystery and anything goes

Alone on the outside

The end is uncertain  
And I've never been so afraid  
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope  
And that makes me feel brave

You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
Journey to the center of eternity

The time is coming but also going  
And it's leaving never to return  
Maybe forever it could be heaven  
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn  
  
It goes, forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes

I got to travel forever  
It's all within my mind  
An endless path to endeavor  
But forever is a long long time  
  
There's no secrets and no corruption  
In the center of infinity  
There's no limits in non-existence  
And no beginning to my destiny  
  
It goes, forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes

Chasing rockets and grasping my head  
They can call it justice, a retribution  
But the reasons are never clear  
  
Freedom is just mans' invention  
And a soldier is just a slave  
Self inflicted  
So addicted  
Our habits are hard to break  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alive  
Watching better turn to worse  
(Watching better turn to worse)  
One more time  
Try to civilize the universe  
(Civilize the universe)  
  
Without the righteous  
Without the faithful  
We would never accept the obscene  
  
A false confession, and priest's obsession  
Is the demon the light to be seen  
Burn the witch and hang his head as  
There's only one choice to be made  
With thought restricted  
And heart afflicted  
The truth be so hard to take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The righteous and the faithful  
Give the good man to the blind  
The world full of confusion  
From every disease confined  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Try to civilize the universe

Still broken wings can't hold me down  
I'm free again  
The jester with a broken crown  
It won't be me this time around to love in vain

And I feel the time is right although I know  
That you just might say to me  
What ya gonna do  
What ya gonna do  
'Cause I have to take this chance  
Goodbye to friends and true romance  
And to all of you  
And to all of you

And the weather's lookin fine and I think the sun will shine again  
And I feel I've cleared my mind all the past is left behind again

I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now  
I told them I had ridden shooting stars  
And I said I'd show them how  
  
Over and over always tried to get away  
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay  
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide  
People around me talking to the walls inside

Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me  
You don't need a ticket to fly with me--I'm free

Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds  
Watching my body disappear into the crowd

He was dark and overcast.  
With long, grey hair and eyes that stared  
Through me like I was glass.  
I asked ""Where are you going to?""  
He said, ""I'm the wind I'm just blowing through.""  
He lit up a cigarette and began to talk.  
  
Said:  
""The doctors told me that my body won't hold me,  
My lungs are turning black.  
Been lucky strikes four since I was at school now there ain't no turning  
Back.  
They can't tell me how long I've got,  
Maybe months but maybe not,  
So I'm taking this bike and riding to New York.  
  
'Cause I wanna see my grand-daughter one last time,  
Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny  
Heart beat next to mine.  
Wanna see my son and the man he's become,  
Tell him I'm sorry for the things I've done,  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York  
  
Through the forests of West Constant  
That I knew as a boy,  
Past the sky line of Chicago,  
Round the lakes of Illinois  
I lay my head in a motel bed where my back gets sore and my eyes turn red,  
Listen to the trucks roll past my door.  
Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold.  
I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold.  
And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turn piked holes.  
And I won't stop 'till I get to New York.  
  
'Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time.  
I wanna see his eyes sparkling ans stare back into mine.  
Now my time is short,  
I wanna see my daughter,  
Tell her all the things that I should have taught her  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York.  
  
And I'd go up to the churchyard one last time,  
Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me the best years of my life,  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Yeah, I'd do it if I had to walk.  
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York. ""

Hearts are sad and eyes are tired  
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired  
Gives us wings  
It gives us rings around our eyes  
  
We put three sugars in our tea  
Sit to watch too much day time TV  
And laugh at mums  
Who don't know who the father is  
  
And all our girlfriends are long gone  
We watch too much internet porn  
Who needs love  
When you've got silicone and strap ons  
  
And beer bloats our spoiled guts  
And shit jobs keep us in ruts  
And keep us eying up  
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes  
  
And falling over in the street  
Is just a part of every week  
And we lie drunkenly  
Just staring at the stars  
  
Remember when they were in reach  
And all the teachers used to teach  
You can do anything  
If you put your mind to it  
  
We put our minds to it all  
But disappointment crashed the ball  
We could have done anything  
But we just never quite knew it

Press up against me, I'll hold you so tight  
I got these matches, we'll let off some smoke  
Maybe they'll see us and maybe they won't

I'll lie awake listening out for cars

Free from my innocence  
There is no circumstance too severe  
Only the need for us, for us to believe again  
  
There is a time, temptation's on the run  
Dreamer, you've had your way  
Soldier, you've had your day in the sun  
Now it's time, oh, it's time for us to begin again

Wrapped in a silhouette of gold and gray

To change our destiny

No one would ever suspect, your so adept at the art  
I hear the lonely lover sigh  
You hide behind cosmetic eyes  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You're the Picasso of pain, a fantasy in fleshtone  
And though you're never the same  
You're never far from the mark  
Now and then you close your eyes  
To see the heartbreak in disguise  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You see just what you want to see  
Who's to blame?  
Love is love by any name  
Who's to blame?  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof

Blowing through your life you will find no shelter  
Or is it answers tonight?  
  
Castles made of sand are built against the rain  
And their fragile walls will never claim you  
Hear the distant thunder calling out your name  
Crashing like the waves on New Dream Islands  
  
And you search for comfort in a land so fair  
Reachin' for those memories that are always there

But it's just illusion that you hold so dear

Haunted by images dark and cold

And covers of magazines  
There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling  
You were coming apart at the seems  
There were jerk offs too numerous to mention  
When everybody shared the dream  
But when it came time to share the nightmare  
They were conveniently nowhere to be seen  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Oh they'll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted  
And just to be fair, ya' know that some of it's true  
That's why ya' gotta be careful, 'bout your wishes  
Take your time and think 'em over  
Sometimes those wishes just might come true  
  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
Tell 'em you've had enough, and if they don't like it it's tough  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
You're Takin' It Back  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back

And saw that boppin' all around  
He learned to do it, there's no doubt  
I'm afraid someday he'll burn his motor out

Now the rhumba, samba, then the bop

For if still loving you means I'm weak  
Then I'm weak  
For I still fall apart when we speak  
Or we meet  
If the love that we knew  
Won't bother you  
Darling you're stronger than me  
  
If you can have fun  
With some other one  
With no thought of what used to be  
If it's easy to say  
That it's better this way  
Darlin you're stronger than me

Desire to dance  
Too startled to try  
Wrap my legs 'round you  
Starting to fly

Coming for the kill, kill, kill

Heading for a spill  
Oh, but it's all spilt milk to me

Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and
transform waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest preoccupation of man  
Man being the chosen alloy, he must be reconnected via shit, at all cost  
Inherent within us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from
the clay of man  
And to recreate from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold  
  
All must not be art  
Some art we must disintegrate  
Positive, anarchy must exist

I feel it feeling no pain

There was a band playing in my head

They were flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.

Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves  
Desperate men, desperate women divided  
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls  
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born  
On midsummer's eve near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected  
Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace.  
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste.

The lights of the city  
So bold and flashing  
All of it's riches  
Imparted to thee  
Robes of saffron  
Robes of standing  
A road of crimson  
Spread at your feet  
  
Your robes of standing  
Your robes of saffron  
Your road of crimson  
All pleasing to me  
But close your lights  
Close your gates

My flock awaits

Tend to thy sheep

We sat for a while he was very engaging  
And when he was gone I was gone on a smile  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That led me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I heard me a music that drew me to dancing  
Lo I turned under his spell  
I opened my coat but he never came closer  
I bolted the door and whispered oh well  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That let me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me  
Wondering well I just couldn't discern  
Will he come back come back to me  
Oh I whispered will you ever return  
  
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary  
He was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke  
The life in his fingers unwound my existence

I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it  
It was ladened with all kinds of shit  
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing  
I turned my back walked away  
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing  
  
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner  
I was listening they were saying this and saying that  
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered  
Nothing good was coming I just stood there  
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing  
I walked the floor then I looked away  
  
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing  
How long how long will we make do  
Maybe it's time to break on through  
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up  
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something  
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back  
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue  
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card  
Well I'm gonna do something

You can refrain but I'm gonna do something

I saw it floating in the river  
I saw and no one seemed to mind  
They sat there they sat there watching the sun  
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble  
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun  
Spread its wings and fly away

The shift of being  
Who will perceive  
When life is new  
Shall we divide and become another  
Who is due for gift upon gift  
Who will decide  
Shall we swim over and over

Like I don't owe nobody nothing

How far I can relax  
Into the cold wave of a note.  
  
When everything hits just right (just and right)  
The note of nobility can go on forever.  
I never tire of the solitary E  
And I trust my guitar  
And I don't care about anything.  
  
Sometimes I feel like I've broken through  
And I'm free and I could dig into eternity  
Into eternity riding the wave  
And realm of the E.  
Sometimes it's useless.  
  
Here I am struggling and filled with dread  
Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough  
Graphite from my damaged cranium  
To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes  
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page.  
  
Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy.  
Inside I must continue.  
I see her, my stiff muse,  
Jutting around round round  
Round like a broken speeding statue.  
  
The colonial year is dead  
And the Greeks too are finished.  
The face of Alexander remains not only solely  
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight  
And magnetism of Alexander himself.  
  
The artist must maintain his swagger.  
He must he must he must be intoxicated  
By ritual as well as result.  
Look at me I am laughing.  
I am laughing.  
I am lapping cocaine from the hard brown palm  
Of the bouncer. and I trust my guitar.  
  
Therefore we black out together.  
Therefore I would run through scum.  
And scum is just ahead, ah we see it,  
But we just laugh.  
We're ascending through the hollow mountain.  
We are peeking.  
We are laughing.  
We are kneeling.  
We are laughing.  
We are radiating at last.

Our gas a gas that we pass.

Trumpeting bliss

Seemed like a lost soul  
From the chapel of dreams  
With a handful of images  
Faces of children  
Phases of the moon  
One little thing you get wrong  
Changes the dimensions  
Streets, swept memory  
Diffused and lost

Whether you're waking up  
Or going to sleep  
Spiralling  
Unnumbered streets

All the sights, the treasures of the eye

Soaked with the bodies of so many friends.  
  
Johnny waved  
He was on his way home  
He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,  
And all the twisted things he'd seen.  
He waved goodbye  
And the blades hit  
Something  
Maybe just fate, but the blades hit  
The 'copter went up in flames  
And johnny never went marchin' home  
Johnny never went marchin' home  
  
They took his name  
And they carved it on a slab of marble  
With several thousand other names  
All the fallen idols  
The apples of their mother's eye  
Just another name  
  
Meanwhile  
Back on that burning shore  
Johnny's comrades stood speechless  
They looked with uh-uh-uh-uh disbelieving eyes  
As those bits of metal and the embers  
The embers of his eyes  
Fanned out into the air  
Black dust  
Flames  
  
Oh johnny! Some day they'll make a movie about you  
And in the making of that movie  
Some mad apocalypse  
It will become even stranger than the simple act  
Just a boy going up up up  
Just a boy going up  
In flames in the smoke  
Just another life  
Just another breath

Eternal as a slab on a green hill

And all your fallen brothers  
And all the ones not cut  
All the ones remembered only in the hearts  
A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter

We conceived of your breath  
We conceived of the whole human race  
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing  
Like a tulip bending in the wind  
Sometimes it comes back to us  
In the form of a handful of dust  
Comes back in the form of a smitten child  
Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones  
Souls cleaved from hearts  
They come back to us  
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues  
But we turn not our backs  
We press our lips  
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one  
And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you

Well here, go ahead, run through that flame  
Awww man, running through your mind  
You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail  
And you swirled it around your head  
And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it

Wake up arms

For as one to march the streets  
  
Each alone, each part of another  
Your steps shall ring  
Shall raise the cloud  
And they that will hear will hear  
Will hear voice of the one  
And the one and the one  
As it has never been uttered before  
  
For something greater yet to come  
Then the hour of the prophets  
And their great cities  
  
For the people of Ninevah  
Fell to their knees  
Heeding the cry of Jonah  
United  
Covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes  
And called to their god  
  
And all their hearts were as one heart.  
And all their voices were as one voice.  
  
God heard them and his mind was moved.

Will they call to God?

What does it tell us?  
  
That an individual has passed  
Is saluted  
And mourned by his countrymen.  
  
This ritual extends to us all.  
For we are all the individual.  
  
No unknown.  
No insignificant one  
Nor insignificant labor  
Nor insignificant act of charity  
  
Each has a story to be told and retold  
Which shall be a glowing thread  
In the fabric of Man  
  
And the children shall march  
And bring the colors forward  
Investing within them  
  
The redeeming blood  
Of their revolutionary hearts.

Patti Smith,Trespassers,/p/patti+smith/trespassers_20617036.html,"Life is designed  
With unfinished lines  
That another sings  
Each story unfolds  
Like it was gold  
Upon a ragged wing  
  
The bold and the fair  
Suffer their share  
He whispered to his kin  
All of my debts  
Left with regrets  
I'm sorry for everything  
  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Winding as they may  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Hope to mend them one day  
  
And she pinned back her hair  
Shouldered with care  
The burdens that were his  
Mending the coat  
That hung on the post  
In heart remembering  
  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Winding as they may  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Hope to mend them one day  
  
And her time was to come  
Called to her son  
This your song to sing  
All of our debts  
Wove with regrets  
Upon a golden string  
And he found the old coat  
Hung on a post  
Like a ragged wing  
And took as his own  
The sewn and unsown  
Joyfully whistling

Patti Smith,Up There Down There,/p/patti+smith/up+there+down+there_20105212.html,"Up there  
There's a ball of fire  
Some call it the spirit  
Some call it the sun  
Its energies are not for hire  
It serves man  
It serves everyone  
Down there where Jonah wails  
In the healing water  
In the ready depths  
Twisting like silver swans  
No line of death no boundaries  
  
Up there  
The eye is hollow  
The eye is winking  
The winds ablaze  
Angels howling  
The sphinx awakens  
But what can she say  
You'd be amazed  
  
Down there  
Your days are numbers  
Nothing to fear  
There will be trumpets  
There will be silence  
In the end the end  
Will be here just here  
  
Ah the borders of heaven  
Are zipped up tight tonight  
The abstract streets  
The lights like some switched on Mondrian  
Cats like us are obsolete  
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet  
Thieves, poets we're inside out  
And everybody's a soldier  
Angels howl at those abstract lights  
And the borders of heaven  
Are zipped up tight tonight  
  
Up there  
There's a ball of fire  
Some call it the spirit  
Some call it the sun  
Its energies are not for hire  
It serves man  
It serves everyone  
The air we breathe  
The flame of wisdom  
The earth we grind  
The beckoning sea  
It's no mystery  
Not sentimental  
Ah the equation  
It's all elemental  
  
The world is restless  
Heaven in flux  
Angels appear  
From the bright storm  
Out of the shadows  
Up there, down there  
But what can we say  
Man's been forewarned  
  
All communion is not holy  
Even those that fall  
They can prophet understanding  
It's all for man  
It's for everyone  
It's up there, down there  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
Time for communion  
Time for communion  
Talking communion

They were dreaming crazy dreams  
In foreign alphabet  
Lucky young boys  
Cross on the main  
The driver was approaching  
The American zone  
The waving of hands  
The tiniest train  
They never dreamed  
They'd never wake again  
  
Voice of the Swarm  
We follow we fall  
Some kneel for priests  
Some wail at walls  
Flag on a match head  
God or the law  
And they'll all go together  
Where duty calls  
  
United children  
Child of Iran  
Parallel prayers  
Baseball Koran  
I'll protect Mama  
I'll lie awake  
I'll die for Allah  
In a holy war  
I'll be a ranger  
I'll guard the streams  
I'll be a soldier  
A sleeping Marine

In the heart of the ancient  
Ali smiles  
In the soul of the desert  
The sun blooms  
Awake  
Into the glare of all out little wars  
Who pray to return to salute  
The coming and dying of the moon  
Oh sleeping sun  
  
Assassin in prayer  
Laid a compass deep  
Exploding dawn  
And himself as well  
Their eyes for his eyes  
Their breath for his breath  
All to his end  
  
And a room in Lebanon  
Dust of scenes  
Erase and blend  
May the blanket of Kings  
Cover them and him  
  
Forgive them Father  
They know not what they do  
From the vast portals  
Of their consciousness  
They're calling to you

Forming equations but the questions are hard

And our children they're being blown away like wishes in the wind  
For the sake of their coat  
Or the colors of their coat  
Or the color of their skin  
Or the name on their shoes

""Why they taken my son?""  
And the father wonders  
""Are they taking my boy?""

You're Still Going To Hear Me Say...  
  
When The Hell Gives You The Right To Tell Me What To Do With My Life?  
Especially When You Made A Mess Of Every Chance You Have To Success.  
Look At You. Oh Look At You.  
I Said I'm Angry Just Looking At You.  
  
Shouting Down Again Mahama. Shouting Down Again.  
Shouting Down Agaun Mahama. Shouting Down Again.  
  
I Can't Begin To Tell You All The Reasons Why You're Making Me Crazy.  
I've Got So Many Answers Like You're Stupid, Like You're Crooked, Like You're
Lazy.  
  
Hit Me With Your Left, Hit Me With Your Right.  
Hit Me From The Top To The Toe.  
Even When You Chew Me Up And Spit Me Out,  
I'm Still Going To Want To Know.

Paul McCartney,Another Day,/p/paul+mccartney/another+day_20105522.html,"Every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair,  
Wraps a towel around her  
As she's heading for the bedroom chair,  
Its just another day.  
Slipping into stockings,  
Stepping into shoes,  
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat.  
Ah, it's just another day.  
  
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break,  
Drinks another coffee  
And she finds it hard to stay awake,  
  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day.  
  
Ay  
So sad, so sad,  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,  
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.  
  
Ah, stay, don't stand around  
And he comes and he stays  
But he leaves the next day,  
So sad.  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
  
As she posts another letter to the sound of five,  
People gather round her  
And she finds it hard to stay alive,  
  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day.

So sad, so sad,  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,

Speak to the man in the street  
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?  
  
Well, I'm talking to a former engine driver  
Trying to find out what he used to do  
Tells me that he always kept his engine  
Spit and polished up as good as new  
But he said his only great ambition  
Was to work with lions in a zoo  
Oh to work with lions in a zoo  
Yes dear, you heard right  
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night

Well, I met a woman working as a waitress  
I asked exactly what it was she did  
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides  
Winter time she ran away and hid  
Once she had a Hollywood audition  
But the part was given to a kid  
Yes,the part was given to a kid  
Yes sir, you heard it right  
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grown up overnight  
  
Well I bumped into a man who'd been a boxer  
Asked him what had been his greatest night  
He looked into the corners of his memory  
Searching for a picture of the fight  
But he said he always had a feeling  
That he lacked a little extra height  
(Could have used a little extra height)  
Yes mate, you heard right  
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height

I saw a woman walking in the sand  
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay  
To meet a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Her destination was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Way back in history, three thousand years  
In fact, ever since the world began  
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears  
Over a brown-eyed, handsome man  
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, the Venus de Milo was a beautiful lass  
She had the world in the palm of her hand  
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match  
To win a brown-eyed, handsome man  
She fought, and won herself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind  
Between a doctor and a lawyer man  
Her mother told her daughter  
Go out, and find yourself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a two, three the count with nobody home  
He hit a high-flyer into the stand  
A-rounded third, he was a-heading for home  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man that won the game  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man

Wonder how you manage to feed the rest

Paul McCartney,London Town,/p/paul+mccartney/london+town_20105665.html,"Walking down the sidewalk one purple afternoon,  
I was accosted by a barker  
Playing a simple tune upon his flute.  
Toot toot toot toot.  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town.  
  
People pass me by on my imaginary street,  
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet,  
Holding conversations that are always incomplete.  
Well I don't know.  
  
Oh, where are there places to go?  
Someone, somewhere has to know.  
I'don't know.  
  
Out of work again, the actor entertains his wife  
With the same old stories of his ordinary life.  
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife.  
Well, I don't know.  
  
Oh, where are there places to go?  
Someone, somewhere has to know.  
  
Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon,

Wearing a pink balloon about his foot.  
Toot toot toot toot.

Upon the dirty ground of London town.

Rrd beans and rice from kitchen windows  
It's supper-time and the barrio is dark.

No one can know your heart the way I do  
No one can testify to all that you've been though

In the sacramental house your stepfather in black  
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
Nobody can know your heart the way i do  
No one can testify to all that you've been through  
But this will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Came here when I was a child.  
Small change and sunlight, then I left these streets for good.  
My days as short as they were wild.  
  
I'm Frenchy Cordero, I'm Angel Soto  
Indio Rivera, 'Baboo' Charlie Cruz  
The faces blurred in every grainy photo  
And fading headline of the Daily News  
  
Judge's Voice  
Wiltwych School for Criminal Children  
Auburn, Brooklyn House of D.,  
Dannemora, Sing-Sing, Attica,  
Greenhaven  
  
Twenty years inside, today you're free  
  
You cannot even read your story  
The pages piling up in shame  
Before the words released you, the  
Guard would kill the light  
The night you took The Capeman for your name.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Yo nacir in Puerto Rico  
All my heart is Puerto Rico  
All my soul is Puerto Rico

Floating out on the tide,  
Following the river of death downstream?  
Oh, is it a dream?  
  
There's a fog along the horizon,  
A strange glow in the sky,  
And nobody seems to know where you go,  
And what does it mean?  
Oh, is it a dream?  
  
Bright eyes,  
Burning like fire.  
Bright eyes,  
How can you close and fail?  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale?  
Bright eyes.  
  
Is it a kind of shadow,  
Reaching into the night,  
Wandering over the hills unseen,  
Or is it a dream?  
  
There's a high wind in the trees,  
A cold sound in the air,  
And nobody ever knows when you go,  
And where do you start,  
Oh, into the dark.  
  
Bright eyes,  
Burning like fire.

Bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness

Goodbye to romance

I'm a rag-a-muffin child.  
Pointed finger-painted smile.  
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while.  
  
Cloudy  
My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy,  
They have no borders, no boundaries.  
They echo and they swell  
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell.  
Down from Berkeley to Carmel.  
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill.  
  
Hey sunshine  
I haven't seen you in a long time.  
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?  
These clouds stick to the sky  
Like floating questions, why?  
And they linger there to die.  
They don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I.

But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue

Worlds apart on a rainy afternoon  
But the road gets dirty and it offers no resistance

And walked along the cliffs above the sea

and here's my song, here's my song.  
  
My father was a fisherman,  
my mama was a fisherman's friend,  
and I was born in the boredom and the chowder.  
So when I reached my prime  
I left my home in the Maritimes,  
headed down the turnpike for New England, sweet New England.  
  
Holes in my confidence,  
holes in the knees of my jeans,  
I was left without a penny in my pocket  
Oo-oowee, I was about as destituted as a kid could be  
and I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
I'd like to hock it  
  
A young girl in a parkin' lot  
was preaching to a crowd,  
singing sacred songs  
and reading from the Bible.  
Well, I told her I was lost  
and she told all about the Pentecost,  
and I seen that girl as the road to my survival,  
my survival.  
  
Just later on  
the very same night  
when I crept to her tent with a flashlight  
and my long years of innocence ended:  
well, she took me to the woods,  
sayin' ""Here comes something, and it feels so good!"",  
and just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended.  
  
Oh, oh, what a night,  
oh, what a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers:  
I was playing my guitar  
lyin' underneath the stars  
just thankin' the Lord  
for my fingers,  
for my fingers

On wings of silver

Sail serenely by.

Where winged horses fly?  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again.  
Go.  
Go and ask the magpie  
""Where do unicorns go?""  
In the trees  
The birds have learned to speak

In a parade of clouds  
Playing hide and seek.

Through the window of my eyes  
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets  
To England where my heart lies.  
  
My mind's distracted and diffused  
My thoughts are many miles away  
They lie with you when you're asleep  
And kiss you when you start your day.  
  
And a song I was writing is left undone  
I don't know why I spend my time  
Writing songs I can't believe  
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.  
  
And so you see I have come to doubt  
All that I once held as true  
I stand alone without beliefs  
The only truth I know is you.  
  
And as I watch the drops of rain  
Weave their weary paths and die  
I know that I am like the rain  
There but for the grace of you go I

Old folks wept for His love in these hard times  
  
""Well, we got to get going,"" said the restless Lord to the Son  
There are galaxies yet to be born  
Creation is never done  
Anyway, these people are slobs here  
If we stay it's bound to be a mob scene

Loved you the first time I saw you  
Can't describe it any other way  
Any other way  
The light of her beauty was warm as a summer day  
Clouds of antelope rolled by  
No hint of rain to come  
In the prairie sky  
It's just love, love, love, love, love  
  
When the rains came, the tears burned, windows rattled, locks turned  
It's easy to be generous when you're on a roll  
It's hard to be grateful when you're out of control  
And love is gone  
  
The light at the edge of the curtain  
Is the quiet dawn  
The bedroom breathes  
In clicks and clacks  
Uneasy heartbeat, can't relax

Moonlight into gold, earth to green and blue

Maybe now I can exit and rest  
There's a blizzard rolling down off the banks of Lake Michigan  
Gonna cover the roads of the icy Midwest

On the wall where darkness fell,  
And it's fitting that it should,  
For in darkness I must dwell.

And where will I make my bed tonight?  
When twilight turns to dark

Jesus our Lord was that baby so small  
Laid down to sleep in a humble stall  
Then came the star and it stood overhead  
Shedding its light 'round His little head  
  
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny Thou art  
I'll make a place for Thee in my heart  
And when the stars in the heavens I see  
Ever and always I think of Thee

Paul Simon,Still Crazy After All These Years,/p/paul+simon/still+crazy+after+all+these+years_20105958.html,"I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

Even when it's true  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?

A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt  
The chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault

Feels like a threat  
A voice in your head that you'd rather forget  
No joke, no joke  
You get sick from that unspoken

I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy  
So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember once in a load-out, down in Birmingham  
Yeah, but that didn't feel like love

Who is a witness to, who is a warrior  
Who denies his urge to break and run  
  
Who says: Hard times?

Paul Simon,The Teacher,/p/paul+simon/the+teacher_20105988.html,"There once was a teacher of great renown  
Whose words were like the tablets of stone  
Because it's easier to learn than unlearn  
Because we've passed the point of no return  
Gather your goods and follow me  
Or you will surely die  
  
I was only a child of the city  
My parents were children of immigrant stock  
So we followed as followers go  
Over a mountain with a napkin of snow  
And ate the berries and roots  
That grow along the timberline  
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love  
Sleeps on a quilt of stars  
  
It's cold  
Sometimes you can't catch your breath  
It's cold  
  
Time and abundance thickened his step  
So the teacher divided in two  
One half ate the forests and fields  
The other half sucked all the moisture from the clouds  
And we, we were amazed at the power of his appetite  
  
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love  
Sleeps on a quilt of stars  
  
Sometimes we don't know who we are  
Sometimes force overpowers us and we cry  
My teacher carry me home  
Carry me home my teacher  
Carry me home  
Carry me home my teacher  
Carry me home

The curse it is cast

Paul Simon,Wartime Prayers,/p/paul+simon/wartime+prayers_20559732.html,"Prayers offered in times of peace are silent conversations,  
Appeals for love or love's release  
In private invocations

Gone like a memory from the day before the fires.

Hear lunatics and liars  
Wartime prayers, wartime prayers  
In every language spoken,  
For every family scattered and broken.  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy,  
If you're just a halfway decent man.  
I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan.  
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,  
Even a little drop will do.  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before I'm through.  
  
Times are hard, it's a hard time  
But everybody knows all about hard times.  
The thing is, what are you gonna do?  
Well, you cry and try to muscle through  
Try to rearrange your stuff  
But when the wounds are deep enough,  
It's all that we can bear,  
We wrap ourselves in prayer.

Asleep with the night,  
And her hair, in a fine mist  
Floats on my pillow,  
Reflecting the glow  
Of the winter moonlight.  
She is soft, she is warm,  
But my heart remains heavy,  
And I watch as her breasts  
Gently rise, gently fall,  
For I know with the first light of dawn  
I'll be leaving,  
And tonight will be  
All I have left to recall.  
Oh, what have I done,  
Why have I done it,  
I've committed a crime,  
I've broken the law.  
For twenty-five dollars  
And pieces of silver,  
I held up and robbed  
A hard liquor store.  
My life seems unreal,  
My crime an illusion,  
A scene badly written  
In which I must play.  
Yet I know as I gaze  
At my young love beside me,  
The morning is just a few hours away.

Down. Cry me a river dried up and dammed.

Rise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line.  
Rise. You can't be neutral on a moving train.  
One day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away.  
And if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done.  
  
Won't let the light escape from me.  
Won't let the darkness swallow me.  
  
So long.

So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
  
We were out on a date in my daddy's car  
We hadn't driven very far  
There in the road, up straight ahead  
A car was stalled, the engine was dead  
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right  
I'll never forget the sound that night  
The screaming tires, the busting glass  
The painful scream that I heard last.  
  
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good

There were people standing all around  
Something warm flowing through my eyes  
But somehow I found my baby that night  
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said  
""Hold me darling just a little while.""  
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss  
I found the love that I knew I had missed  
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight  
I lost my love, my life that night.

Covered with leather but it wasn't tight  
Underneath the moon in the woods at night  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:

Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack

Just like a man of leather to whom I may be related

Piercing me right through the core,  
It says, ""Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more.""

Soon are all gonna work out.

There's that anguish, there's that doubt.

There's lots of things to think about, when you're feelin' blue  
So I'm gonna take all the loneliness, sit right down with the blues!  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories  
Give my self a party, think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
I'm gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues!

So just relax  
Don't question why for calculated facts  
Will not apply

Shrugged him off, and locked the door  
So good, this far

One day I'll read, or learn to drive a car  
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest  
But I don't like to compete, or talk street, street, street

Stick with the gang, if you want to belong  
  
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy  
In a world of my own at the back of the garden  
I didn't want to compete, or play out on the street

Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat  
  
It's not a crime when you look the way you do  
The way I like to picture you  
When I get home, it's late at night  
I pour a drink and watch the fight  
  
Turn off the TV, look at a book  
Pick up the phone, fix some food  
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day  
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

Pass the test - and don't compete  
  
Drive the car, if you're with me  
Che Guevara's drinking tea  
He reads about a new device  
And takes to the stage in a secret life

It's always dark  
In Luna Park  
On the shooting range  
The plastic prizes never change  
So make your mark  
On Luna Park  
  
And when we're getting higher  
We're happy  
Somebody's eating fire  
We're happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Thunder. I wonder?  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It can't be dark  
Too soon  
  
A storm is coming soon  
Like dust on the moon  
  
Every night we go  
To the latest horror show  
And hear the screams  
In Luna dreams  
Fortune-tellers muse  
On palms that bode bad news  
The future's dark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when we're feeling scared  
We're happy  
With circuses and bread  
We're happy  
The whirling fair machines  
Are all we need  
  
Thunder. I wonder?  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It can't be dark  
Too soon

Pet Shop Boys,Metamorphosis,/p/pet+shop+boys/metamorphosis_20107113.html,"Please allow me to try and explain  
I'm living proof that man can change  
I knew what I wanted  
I knew how to get it  
  
It didn't make it happy so I started again  
What I wanted to be was a family man  
But nature had some alternative plans  
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold  
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
  
But every now and then  
Often at night  
A particular feeling would surface in spite  
Of what I told myself and tried to deny  
I kept on asking the question: why?

A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
With time and age I had to change  
Cause my behaviour was getting strange  
People on the street caught my eye  
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy  
  
The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge  
Was in retreat and I was on the verge  
Of falling in love or having fun  
Time was running out  
Something had to be done  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
Where was I?  
Laying down the law  
Dancing with others  
Out on the floor  
  
Music and smoke  
What did it mean?  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
I had what I wanted  
  
Madly in love  
Nothing else mattered  
This was enough  
Questions were answered  
Which used to perplex  
In particular those about the big s.e.x.  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason

It's a metamorphosis  
  
Dreaming is easy  
Life is tough  
I got the picture  
The most important thing  
  
Is not to end up bitter  
Cause when you start to feel  
Increasingly forlorner  
Woomph! love comes  
Right around the corner  
  
It may not last  
But here am I  
Once a caterpillar  
Now a butterfly  
It can seem strange  
But when you reminisce  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis

My world's gone mad, what did you do?  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!  
  
I can't make sense of anything  
All I know is the party's in full swing  
If we both just stopped for a minute  
I declare war and then you'd win it  
  
To tell you the truth, I thought I was shockproof  
Until I saw what you get up to  
When you think about it, it's quite an achievement  
That after all I still love you  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium

My world's gone mad, what did you do?

Reviewed but never seen  
Where everybody played themselves  
As a drama king or queen  
  
The music was overwhelming  
Glitter in and fiend  
Some are chavy like a requiem  
In Denim and Leopardskin  
  
I visualise the flashbacks  
School, home cross obsess  
Heart is too much of everything  
The cliches, the candles, the mess  
  
Lucy and I never seen with David  
Brian never talks  
Help me in policks and sense in Arnold  
Tell me all about Reddocks  
Ozzy's last collection  
Beavis closed himself  
A little more rouge and powder cheeks  
But the base is pay off  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
In ended with a motorbike  
A search for every dance  
Pouring over our photographs  
To make it all fake sense  
Glomorous in it's own way  
Shouting above the dead

In denim and leopardskin  
  
Janice and Marlyn, Ronald Creepers  
Malcom's around the block  
Adam's in the jungle film  
But Luc has let it walk  
The Johnsons and the Jenkins  
Hail by keeping smile  
All you need to make it big  
It takes some style
