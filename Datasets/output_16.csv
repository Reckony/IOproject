One Direction,Tell Me That You Want Me,/o/one+direction/tell+me+that+you+want+me_21028107.html,"Another night I'm waiting for you  
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn  
It's you I am looking for  
Another night of summer passes  
Wide awake I'm waiting for you patiently  
I want something more...  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want me  
  
Tell me why can't you just tell me  
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me?  
I'm stronger than you know  
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment  
I'm sure what you're looking for  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want you  
  
Remember last November  
When I met you in the rain  
Remember what you told me  
Are you feeling still the same  
Did you tell the truth then  
Or was it just another game  
Tell me (x3)

One Direction,The Way You Look Tonight,/o/one+direction/the+way+you+look+tonight_21051007.html,"There was a time  
I was everything and nothing all in one  
When you found me  
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun  
  
I need to tell you  
How you light up every second of the day  
But in the moonlight  
You just shine like a beacon on the bay  
  
And I can't explain  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside  
And I can't describe  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
The way you look tonight  
The way you look tonight

You tell me that your tears are here to stay  
But I know you're only hiding  
And I just wanna see you  
  
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain  
And I can see your head is held in shame,  
But I just wanna see you smile again  
See you smile again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you  
And I'll be here for you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
I wish that I could take you to the stars  
I'd never let you fall and break your heart  
And if you wanna cry or fall apart  
I'll be there to hold you  
  
You tell me that you hurt, it's all in vain  
But I can see your heart can love again  
And I remember you laughing  
So let's just laugh again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you, back to you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
And you don't need  
You don't need to worry  
And you will see it's easy to be loved  
I know you wanna be loved  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer

Something passed by, and I went into a dream.

Everything is lost.  
Torn by the arrival of Autumn.  
The blink of an eye, you know it's me.  
You keep the dagger close at hand.  
And you saw nothing.  
False love turned to pure hate.  
The wind cried a lamentation,  
before merging with the grey.  
Demon of the fall.  
Gasping for another breath.  
She rose, screaming at closed doors.  
  
Seductive faint mist forging  
through the cracks in the wall.  
I shan't resist.  
In tears for all of eternity.  
She turned around and faced me for the first time.  
Run away, run away.  
Just one second, and I was left with nothing.  
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air.  
That day came to an end.  
And she had lost in me, her credence.

Words would falter to atone

She had sworn her vows to another  
This is when no-one will bother  
  
And conceded pain in crumbling mirth  
A harlot of God upon the earth  
Found where she sacrificed her ways  
That hollow love in her face

The contentment that would fill the crack  
My soul released a fluttering sigh  
This day fell, the darkness nigh  
  
I took her by the hand to say  
All faith forever has been washed away  
I returned for you in great dismay  
Come with me, far away to stay  
  
Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime  
She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme  
But baffled herself with the final line  
My promise is made but my heart is thine

Hides my last trace

Wrapped in eons  
My mind is one with my soul  
I fall alone  
While leaves fall from the weeping trees

Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception  
  
In the year of his sovereign  
Rid us of your judgment

So used to losing all ambition  
And struggling to maintain what's left

There is a road I'm always walking  
And I know you'll never return to this place  
  
Once undone, there's only smoke  
Burning in my eyes to blind

Clouds gathered across the moon  
Blazing, the white light  
  
Passing the lake I know so well  
I am near, yet so far away  
  
Arrival...

Awaits the day  
Standing silent smiling at my presence  
A black candle holds the only light  
  
Darkness encloses  
And the candle seems to expire  
In her cold, cold hand  
And as a forlorn soul  
It will fade away  
  
Touching her flesh in this night  
My blood froze forever  
Embraced before the dawn  
A kiss brought total eclipse  
  
And she spoke  
Once and forever

In mist enrobed the twilight

A fathomless void enclosing.  
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.

Overture of the long, black night begins

Faithful me  
Pour yourself  
Into me  
  
Wield your power  
Martyr's price  
Stare me down  
To the ground  
  
Slake my thirst  
Eternal wealth  
Heathen key  
Round my neck  
  
This poetry  
Our blasphemy  
Know the sounds  
Of infamy  
  
The eyes of the devil  
Fixed on his sinners  
  
The hands of Satan  
Assembling his flock  
Pale horse rider  
Searching the earth  
  
Whispered conjuration  
A belief takes form  
Choking hand tapping  
The veins in your throat  
  
His orders in your mouth  
A decree for domination  
Beneath the tides of wisdom  
Spins the undertow of hate  
  
Injected seeds of vengeance  
Usurper's eyes of the powerless  
Clean path to his kingdom  
Beckoning in the mist  
  
Tell my why  
Love subsides  
In the light  
Of your wishes  
  
Say my name  
Ease the pain  
Clear the smoke  
In my head

Opeth,The Lotus Eater,/o/opeth/the+lotus+eater_20740511.html,"Liquid is in your throat  
For hopeless delight  
After all you fell in love with death  
Life has aborted  
All you've had and all you became  
  
The night is calling, you pray forth  
  
A barren waste is your land  
Crops they were sown to die  
  
This skin is a mirror  
The eyes hover with ignorance  
Hell throb from your lips  
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep  
  
All years caring for a liar  
The barren drift road is winding higher  
You're a moth too close to the fire  
  
You are stuck in a beautiful future  
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all  
  
Fleeting in sorrow  
Pushing your spirit away  
Seeking the weakness of dislike  
Whispered from the heart  
To be, we're all in the mourning  
To despair  
  
[?]  
  
Cries out: ""The restless will also... die.""  
  
Resurrection covered with death  
Drawing the life under one  
A fact tied to the earth  
The soul's a victim, a follower  
  
Oh, mother!  
[Incoherent growling]  
For us to see  
The blink of an eye  
  
And the pride of a mother  
Drawn close in a mother's son  
And the love from a father  
Was used by a father's son  
  
Over warrior's token  
Misspoken lives on  
The language unimportant  
So fair and so just  
  
All the land is taken

Jaded and gaunt, some September  
Wilted with the seasons  
But hidden inside the delusion  
I saw you eyes, somewhere  
  
Devoid of death  
The aura poises amidst (the storm)  
In solid tears I linger  
A parlor glade, moonlit sorrow  
Lonely resting pools  
Relics of the moon-dogged lake  
Whisper: ""All your words are miss given""  
  
Am I like them?  
Those who mourn and turn away  
Those who would give anything  
To see you again  
If only for another second  
  
Your face was, like the photograph  
Painted white  
We did not speak very often about it  
What does it matter now?  
  
Cloak of autumn shroud  
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars  
I reckon it is time for me to leave  
  
You sleep in the light  
Yet the night and the silent water  
Still so dark...

Shrouded in crystals  
Through a frosty dusk  
Souls of the full moon awaits  
Their shadows ablaze  
  
We are all bending  
Our tired leaves over your empty shell  
In the sign of true esteem  
Are you beloved lord  
Sighing deep under these waterfalls?  
  
The birds of the sun  
Separates these dark clouds  
While the winds of winter sleeps gently around  
I am sworn to the oath  
To breathe...  
  
At the waters I dwell  
The waves are still whispering  
Ancient lullabies  
I die  
While our mystic brothers still seek  
  
Under your command I will obey  
In my vision  
You are the embodiment of pure freedom  
But through my eyes you are made of stone

Opeth,Wreath,/o/opeth/wreath_20347764.html,"Falling inside again  
This nightmare always the same  
Still never enough  
Halting at the brink of discovery  
  
Moving into the darkness  
Leaking inside to cover up  
Dragging me down and under  
Entangled and undone at once  
  
Old memories  
I'm not in need but wish to know  
What are the tragedies  
The history behind the walls  
  
Pacing further down  
Familiar children's laughter  
Dissonant and out of time  
And they're eyes are dead  
  
Watching myself in a pool of water  
Wearing the mask of a ghost  
Smeared all across my skin  
Rotten earth and insects  
  
Endless night  
Always preserving the calm  
Movement behind  
  
Bleeding animals in a field of fire  
There is no absolution  
Death is but a fairytale  
They are mere visions  
They are afraid of me  
  
Clear insight  
A smoke is rising nearby  
Dust covering my coat  
Blend together to spell my name  
  
Pale, covered me with sweat  
There are no words left  
Sole provider of death  
Distorted faith in myself  
  
Human harvest burning  
Blackest pages turning  
Twisted perception come true  
Captured in dreams connected  
  
Staring right back  
Spiritual decay - Still seeking  
Frozen in time  
Mourn this departure - All watching  
  
Calling me back  
Closure to bleak matters- I'm leaving  
End of a search  
Coming of morning  
  
Calling me back  
Closure to bleak matters- I'm leaving  
End of a search  
Coming of morning - Returning

From the fury and the anger that shall claim them""  
  
And so they set sail across the land ans seas alike  
In a quest to avoid the setting of the sun  
  
""God's rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake... ""  
  
""Thou has stolen, betrayed  
And worshiped pagan gods  
Thou must awake, thy lost faith to be saved""  
  
And so spoke the propets,  
As the mob has gathered round  
(They) said their empire would soon crumble  
And fall down  
  
""Thou art our our brothers, hear our call this day  
We come not to see your end,  
But to revive we pray""  
  
""God's rage is true

To awake... ""  
  
""Where did these three come from""  
Asked the crowd anxiously  
Furious and confused at the same time,  
""Surely these people are lying or jesting.  
Either way they are here to cause harm. ""  
  
""You just be on your way"", said the mob as a  
Warning, ""or else (all) hell will break loose!""  
""It's all a matter of choice..."" said the Eagle,  
Though they really didn't  
Have much to choose...(From)

Hear my cry - will I arrive?

Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?  
Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?  
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue  
Here is the gist  
A practical list of don'ts fer you  
  
Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love

Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
Your eyes musn't glow like mine

Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove  
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things  
  
Unison  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Curly  
Some people claim that you're to blame as much as I  
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?  
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree  
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free  
  
Don't praise my charm too much  
Don't look so vain with me  
Don't stand in the rain with me  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't take my arm too much  
Don't keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine  
Unison  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't dance all night with me  
'Til the stars fade from above  
  
Unison  
They'll see it's all right with me

So many men and girls are in each others arms  
It made me think we might be similarly occupied  
  
Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen  
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

Honey, here's the way it's gonna be  
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses  
In the slickest gig you've ever seen  
  
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters  
When I drive them high steppen strutters  
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!  
  
The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown  
The dashboard's genuine leather  
With Isinglass curtains you can roll right down  
In case there's a change in the weather  
  
Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'  
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'  
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap  
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
Would you say the fringe was made of silk?  
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk  
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?  
One's like snow, the other's more like milk  
  
All the world'll fly in a flurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
When we hit that road hell-for-leather  
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather  
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!  
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along  
The cows'll moo in the clover  
The river will ripple out a whispered song  
And whisper over and over  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
And you'd never stop?  
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
I can see the stars gettin' blurry  
When we ride back home in the surrey  
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey  
With the fringe on top  
I can feel the day gettin' older  
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder  
Noddin', droopin', close to my shoulder  
Till it falls kerplop  
  
The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill  
The moon is taking a header  
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still  
A lark'll wake up in the meader  
  
Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'  
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'  
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'  
At a slow clip clop  
Don't you hurry little surrey

Much stronger than sympathy, let your best friend pull back that leash  
Sitting by a frozen man, someone somewhere has to cry  
Were under zenith again let the cycle run we won't die  
Leave a little room for us to breathe

Under but not to far

Only now I see where we are

My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
It's simply God's amazing grace

What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong

I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I can't understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only you'd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for

No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe

I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's  
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's  
I begged and I begged, of course she said no  
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough  
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade  
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade  
It's crazy how we place these small things as important  
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's  
Rivers that is, not the be -ball player, told the mountains to  
Move and now there's no more Himalayas  
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated  
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated  
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me  
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me  
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow  
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro  
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now  
With all of the joy deep inside  
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing  
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right  
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought  
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong  
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind  
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah  
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome  
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go  
Feels like life has just begun

Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding  
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was  
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most  
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around  
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,  
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen  
It twice, propelling, stopping swelling by applying bags of ice  
I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4  
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision  
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying  
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do  
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew  
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know  
There's a lot to overcome  
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go  
You will feel like life has just begun

Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith  
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him  
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take  
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat  
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden  
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness  
Blessed beyond I gotta move on I gotta move on

Now's your chance to be totally set free

How he saved me, made me holy

I gave it all, this life's no longer mine  
How He made a way kept me alive  
Well, listen close as I testify  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell it like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand, I'm just gonna say it

How he saved my soul

So know I sing  
Just want to sing His praise  
Loving kindness everyday  
Faithfulness that come my way  
I'm gonna clap my hands  
Please excuse me if I start to dance  
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new  
He's been so good to me  
He didn't have to do it but I'm glad He did  
Saved me from my sin  
That old life is gone and new life lives within  
(Of all the things that I could, I write a song)  
I knew I couldn't go wrong  
If I sang of His goodness all day long  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand I'm just gone say it  
(I cannot live my life without Him)  
I made no excuse, if I get a little crazy  
In Him I live and more

So clap your hands this evening  
Come on y'all said it's alright  
Move a little this evening

You know is free indeed, you're free

Out Of Eden,Paradise,/o/out+of+eden/paradise_20295637.html,"I tuned in to the tv once again today  
Watch the news to educate my mind  
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me  
It's our world caught in it's own demise  
(As I sat there I began to cry)  
The situation worsens every day that goes by  
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)  
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me  
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before  
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone  
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat  
(I know God hears us crying out)  
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away  
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)  
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do  
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through  
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you  
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true  
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts  
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart  
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give  
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes

Out Of Eden,Sarah Jane,/o/out+of+eden/sarah+jane_20305496.html,"Little sarah jane ran away from home  
Fourteen and pregnent she was all alone  
Couldn't run from wrong, and was gonna be sent away  
Walkin' with her black and blue eyes full tears  
The burden that she carries much to old for her years  
Looking at her face would confirm your worst fears  
But instead she goes unnoticed  
Sarah Jane another girl who is dying inside  
You'd think that someone would stop  
But we hide, to intent on completing our day  
And she's left there to say  
Chorus:  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street watching you  
You could help me  
But your not looking  
I bet you would if only you knew  
You could make a difference  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street needing you  
I want to make it  
How can I get there?  
If you showed me that you cared, you know  
You could make the difference  
He's left to watch the world from the fifteenth floor  
Alone with the reminder, don't go out anymore  
You know those boys are trouble here in our neighborhood  
But you're my boy and you've got the chance to be something good  
Still the call of the streets was too much to ignore  
Now he's caught up in the game and can't find an open door  
He's a good boy gone bad and he's trying to get out  
But everybody's too afraid to hear what he's talking about  
Marcus Brown, lives a life much too old for his age  
If no one responds, he'll be words on a page  
Another statistic cause no calls were made  
To check on the boy who was missing from the fifth grade  
Chorus

Everywhere you turn there's hurting people passing by  
Its such a shame that we could change a life but we don't try  
To look outside out world

When it's such a rainy day  
Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

I never tooted but its in my veins  
While the rest of the country bungees off bridges  
Without no snap back  
And bitches they say they need that  
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs  
They go the other route  
Turn each other out  
Burn each other out

'scuse me lord less for thinking  
But that's the way we was brought up  
Sneaking to watch playboy at night

Chemistry between boys and girls  
Is a lot like when we went to the woods  
And laid with the squirrels  
During P.E., we'd be  
Exploring each others privates  
Hunching with all our clothes on  
Until we felt excited then,  
Oh now its on from here on out  
Put yo hands in the atmosphere  
If you know what I'm talking bout  
Now if two hearts done walk on out

Got tired of being broke  
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope  
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds  
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head  
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far  
Still battling in this racial war  
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing  
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing  
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge  
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks  
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch  
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be finding much  
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this  
What we stood for ""fuck that fame and that glitz""

And got to be more careful know what corners you be bending  
Revelations getting impatient and now I'm dead  
Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads

Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt

My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow  
My bank account is frozen, I  
don't think that I can get out this hole  
Feel like the figure four leg lock  
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked  
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe  
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds  
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living  
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living  
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning  
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning  
  
But what about repentance?  
What about the tension?  
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?  
But what about repentance?  
What about committing the same sin  
over and over again and again and ah..

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?  
Please tell me, what are we here for?

Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene  
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team  
Well I receive what you want to believe  
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds  
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass  
or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance  
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel  
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle  
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle  
Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible  
As you survey the syllables and sentences  
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying

Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses  
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with  
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift  
I've been a player since the age of two  
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk  
Do how them hoe sellers do  
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be  
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see  
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up  
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up  
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone  
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone  
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat  
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that  
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets  
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it  
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore  
They were my idols when I was a kid  
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon  
To drug dealer, armed robber, now, to big felon

All heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me  
Growin up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be  
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder  
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten  
This ain't no secret garden, so you fly when niggas flee  
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be  
'cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me  
And then I get a slap of dap when I'm slanging quarter keys  
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it  
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working niggas butt naked  
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent  
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent  
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking  
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on dankin'  
'cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain  
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain  
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975  
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive  
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers  
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones

Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go  
  
It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks  
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time  
On a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice  
That's if ya racist or ya crooked  
Arrest me 4 this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it  
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it  
Look at me, you outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid  
Officer, get off me sir  
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir  
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city  
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity  
About the youngsters amongst us  
You think they respect the law  
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'  
And giving the youth the truth from this booth  
And when we on stage we scream  
Don't everybody everybody  
  
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?

You touch me you touch the apple of this eye  
If they kick us out where will we go  
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kin folk  
Still eatin' pork  
Abomination desecration for beating flesh  
Penalty for violation is death  
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on judgment day  
Hip Hip Hooray!  
Mr. Reaper Babylon the great  
The mother of heartless is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled  
The liquor fire is calling

Well burn motherfucker burn American Dream  
Don't everybody like the taste of Apple Pie?

ZX-81, donkey kong, fucking high score  
Push it to the limit, couldn't push it any more  
Wanna be a fucking robot after smoking loads of draw  
  
Bought a speak and spell, stuck it to my chest  
And wraps a fucking ? onto my head and to my vest  
Walking down the stret, my next door neighbours not impressed  
I'm a robot and buying ten fags is my quest  
  
Eggsie's gone too far, he thinks he's robocop  
He's covered in tinfoil and he's got matching metal socks  
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped  
The man robot myth starts to escalate  
  
He tries to sell himself standing in curries  
But if the police turn up, he runs in a fucking hurry  
He tries to plug himself in the mains with his nob  
And when he's fully recharged he goes out on the rob  
  
Half man, half machine  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean?  
  
Half man, half machine  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean?  
  
Being a robot in my digital domain  
Enter my world, feel my pain  
I'm not like other people you might see or you might know  
I made love to a BBC micro  
Touching on the disk drive, the monitor got hot  
I knew from then, I was a motherfucking robot  
Bill Gates from Microsoft, Stephen Hawking's voice  
And fucking Lara Croft  
  
I built a lab, secret in my loft  
And built a special costume that would help me to jack off  
I sat there in front of the screen  
For many years, this had been my wet dream  
Now I've reched it, I'm finally there  
Like terminator being filmed in Aberdare  
So alone, when people stop and stare  
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair  
  
Robot Love  
Robot  
Robotic Breakdancing  
Robot  
  
The doctors found a nut  
They said he was an headcase  
'cos he sticks silver and cans on his face  
  
Sucking off antennas and trying to fuck the fridge  
And burnt his pubic wig, with the high voltage  
  
I am a robot  
My prime directive is to's go to's the shops  
And buy's ten fags  
Do's you's compute?  
  
He wants to buy ten fags, his destination is the shops  
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop  
If your ask him then he'll do a bodypop  
Like terminator, yeah he just won't stop  
  
Put electical cable down through the eye of his cock  
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock  
The reason that he did it wasn't to give himself pain  
Watching Terminator over again and again  
  
Fuck man, get him, fucking restrain him man  
get him fucking, fucking get him down man  
inject him man, get him down  
He's fucking nuts spa and he's losing it  
Help me man, just get him fucking....  
  
Half man, half machine  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean?  
  
Half man, half machine  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean?  
  
Half man, half machine

And I got 'em tied up tight  
So, you're going to find out tonightttttttttt!  
Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner  
Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her  
Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner  
Could be an organ donor  
The way I give up my heart, but  
Never know because - shit, I never tell her!  
Ask me about my feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'  
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'  
And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but  
For the record, have you ever rode a horse?  
Would I like for you to take me to Pluto?  
I said, ""Of course!""  
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse  
Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force  
Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits  
For now, give me examples of why you're the shit!  
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?  
And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?

Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you  
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through  
Now later on done got here  
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?  
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by  
I got up in them draws and I told her bye bye  
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit  
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did

Uh, well you know we getting blizzard cause we got that chicken gizzard  
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggas can't cope with it  
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop  
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park  
So god almighty no, it's Outkast for the 94 era  
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level  
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel  
And you may go to hell  
  
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is  
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is  
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take  
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank

Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you

I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes

Well here's a formal introduction  
Something to make you ponder  
The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!)  
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb  
  
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path  
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took  
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag  
Now that's ass backwards  
  
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst  
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse  
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void  
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life right?  
  
Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being somebody's
wife  
They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night, ain't nothing right or wrong!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Big Boi]  
Even though things started falling apart  
Wanda went and bought a Honda  
Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob  
For a little less than a yard, a massage you could drill her like a sarge  
  
She would charge and rob  
Pick through yo' pockets  
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket  
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license  
  
On the night stand fuckin' with this white man  
She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex  
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet  
Every action has a positive and equal reaction  
  
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion  
Fast and furiously, the was a knock on the sliding glass door (bitch, it's
me!)  
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick  
But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit!

Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl  
Ready to go at any moment jumpin like a pogo stick  
I never lived up to my expectations so I accept the patience  
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin  
Back and forth inside I'm melting like water on wicked bitches  
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences  
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown  
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long  
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen  
I hope He understand I be on bended knees  
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it  
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe  
I've been fighting this since them fetus days  
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase  
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too  
I'm weakening like a deacon doin dirt  
What am I supposed to do?

I'm writin this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it  
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new zits  
Wipin away your germs up under your cranium with juices  
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on  
Straight from west Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home  
Never go wrong 'cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad  
Mosquito, now we goes, I'm proud of you peoples  
For sellin your cracker sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black  
Shit, on the real, that's how them whiteys really act  
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin apart  
You lookin me in my eye, but you ain't feelin me in your heart  
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour  
These niggaz, they leavin me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower  
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome  
But they don't feel like marchin, 'cause they shoes is overrun

Good does not come without pain  
Meaning, before it gets better, it's going get worse  
Like my homies on the sick side still dying over turf  
That don't belong to us  
I mean us, left in the dust  
Try to catch up with massah  
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers  
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against  
Principalities, powers of this world  
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness  
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness  
I spark this thing, but my name ain't Bubba  
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover  
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle  
Yeah, come on, come on  
Guess what, guess what  
Time to reset this thing  
  
[Debra Killings]  
Start over again  
Everything happens for a reason  
Good doesn't come without pain  
Start over again

[Cee-Lo]  
Listen to me  
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright  
This day will be done right  
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door  
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight  
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right  
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right  
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right  
You'll get used to singing if only for one night  
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right  
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless  
And see I focus to provoke this  
So open wide for my opinionated opus  
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this  
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this  
Recognize and realize before any regretting  
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting  
  
[Debra Killings]  
Start over again  
Everything happens for a reason  
Good doesn't come without pain  
Start over again  
Everything happens for a reason

She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours  
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't coming with it  
But I'm with ya you cause you probably going through it anyway  
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it  
Cause I thought it would be jamming but examine all the flawsky-wawsky  
Awfully, it's sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote  
And I hope I never have to float in that boat  
Up shit creek it's weak is the last quote  
That I want to hear when I'm going down when all's said and done  
And we got a new joe in town  
When the record player get to skipping and slowing down  
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then

More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll  
Fuck the rhythm, fuck the rhythm under your bosom  
You're the prism, Shirley Chislom  
Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby  
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter  
Dance on the tip of my tongue  
Shake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them  
Tell your home girls that you will send them  
A postcard from 3000, hard!  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Don't want to make you feel strange, but  
Don't let these words be in vain, so  
Spread, spread for me  
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)  
Nature knows that I want you, but  
Not unless you want me too, so  
Spread, spread for me  
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again  
Why, must we fly so low?  
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love  
Open up you flower please let me taste your love  
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue  
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do  
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room  
Up and down it seems to go  
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode  
  
Chorus

My fingertips scan flesh so supple  
No longer a couple like two in one skin  
Where do you end and where do I begin  
Both brains become one mind sensually  
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity  
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve  
Longing for the love of all the other nevers  
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction  
In the burning chill of please we bathe  
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave  
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction  
But of creation, elation in the re-making  
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation  
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love  
Till ain't nothing but stankonia

When the only sign we had was pickets?  
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked  
Gangs killin' others fo' colors  
Thangs that we wear fo' fashion  
Other brothers take it fo' what reason? To be blastin'  
What da kcuf is goin' on?  
Not soft like buttercups but  
Had enough of singin' that same song  
See, I stayed across the street from the projects  
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk  
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite  
Only been to jail one week fo' some shull-bit  
And I pray to God I won't repeat  
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to  
No, I shouldn't a did that, cuz if I did that?  
Y'all would not hear that phat shit  
That keeps you on yo' tippy-toes  
Like that fella, not callin' no names  
But really, ""who's bad?""  
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms  
You can't forget what you come from

And tell me, do you like what you see  
Masters of deception, corruption and evil  
But you're always quick to point the finger at me  
Won't somebody tell me

Like there's nothing to live for  
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

What gave you the right to misjudge me  
And write me off on the wall  
Acting as if you understand me  
In reality, you just don't know me at all

Sometimes I can't help but wonder  
If this was how it's meant to be

You'll always find a slight reminder of me  
Won't somebody tell me

To lettin' our souls become free

I keep misfocusin' my needs  
And distress on my back with them cats  
They be blastin' into my knapsack  
Ain't no accidental deathtraps  
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap  
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go  
My mind is ready to flow, didn't you know?  
First you catch and then I throw  
It's my own sense of time  
If I'm late, it's 'cuz I'm endin' my day  
Just when the sun shines

As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension

Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change  
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter  
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta  
'Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall  
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all  
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog  
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy  
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum  
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes  
Walking around the table in the kitchen we was practicing  
Reciting rhymes to sharpen minds now lets deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road  
Now its time for me to go  
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Time to spread my wings  
And high up in the sky  
I can fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, so high  
  
Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back  
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat  
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it  
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it  
The first person close to me to die I needed healing  
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling  
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling  
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning  
It's yo birthday even on your worst day  
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre  
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp  
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt  
Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again

Even on the train  
Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again

Now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose  
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew  
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too  
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into  
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock  
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock  
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop  
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!  
  
Before you can say you can't get going  
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly  
You never know what day the doors will close

With a long-forked-tongue-kiss

Calling out to no one there

You say that no one's there  
I say, I've always cared

Doing what you're told  
Go get everything you need until you're dead and cold

Wash the dirt from beneath your nails

The road was long and hard! the climb was rough.  
But to a greater end, ya hang... tough.

Wanted better.  
From the fire to the streets.

Will you give me strength, so I can too  
Never stop the rolling  
I am honored to have known your name  
So proud I am that you feel the same  
As we go from whence we came, rolling  
We are burning more than just the moment  
We are living more than in a moment  
  
Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are  
Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far  
Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust  
Wheelz to our moment, the best of us  
  
Take up arms, stand in a line  
Listen to the march that takes you through time  
Find what you need in the sound of the drum  
And feel in your heart, what only few have done  
  
Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are  
Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far  
Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust  
Wheelz to our moment, the best of us

Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone  
I am floating away

As mountains of fruit tumbled out  
I barely had the chance to shout  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Staying awake that night was rather hard  
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard  
When we woke up buried alive  
Beneath a fruity landslide  
We both laughed hysterically  
It could have been just another dream  
But I swear I heard you scream  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Always a citrus constellation in the galaxy  
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids  
And I've been dying to see  
If you were a beautiful sound  
In the echoes all around  
Then I'd be your harmony  
And we'd sing along with the crowds  
Beneath the candy-coated clouds  
A strawberry avalanche, please crash over me

And made her make-up run  
On our super-lunar honeymoon

And everything was my fault

Happily swinging on the uneven bars  
Tucked in a somersault

Heaven, is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you  
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tradgedy?  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same?  
  
Sometimes, it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams  
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me  
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart and taste the blood from my blade  
And when we sleep would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave?  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same?  
  
Will you ever take me?  
No I just can't take the pain  
Would you ever trust me?  
No I'll never feel the same (oh)

I know I've been so hard on you  
I know I've told you lies  
If I could have just one more wish  
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same? (Oh yeah)

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the days  
The clock ticks life away  
It's So Unreal  
  
Didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on  
But didn't evn know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go..  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, It all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...  
  
One thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how i tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so far  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart

In the great magnetic field  
Where he traveled time  
For the future of mankind  
  
Nobody wants him  
He just stares at the world  
Planning his vengeance  
That he will soon unfold  
  
Now the time is here  
For Iron Man to spread fear  
Vengeance from the grave  
Kills the people he once saved  
  
Nobody wants him

Fills his victims full of dread

Seeing her reflection  
And it blows my mind  
Trying to deny it  
But damage is done  
I'll just run as always  
But the race is run  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out  
  
Read the daily fiction, Superman is dead  
Crushing coins of silver, imitating lead  
Then if you will fix the children of the past  
I guess their's isn't welcome, doesn't time move fast  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out  
  
Night in the shadow of man  
This is the dawn of the dead  
Don't let it live in your head  
And then now as the sabbath begins  
It wakes your nightmare again  
So run away if you can  
So just run  
Run as fast as you can  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
  
Too late too tell me it's over now  
Falling apart at the seams  
No angel sits on my shoulders now  
I hold my head and it screams  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out

Teeth were white and our skin was young  
Eyes as bright as the Spanish Sun  
We had nothing we could hide  
  
Now my dear we are two golden leaves  
Clinging desperately to winter trees  
Got up here like a pair of thieves  
While the sirens blare outside  
  
What's left to say when every word's been spoken?  
What's left to see when our eyes won't open?  
What's left to do when we've lost all hope and  
What's left to break when our hearts are broken?  
  
But sometimes...  
  
Do you remember how this started out?  
So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt  
A dirty joke we used to laugh about  
But it's not funny anymore  
  
I fear I choke unless I spit it out  
Still smell of smoke, although the fire's gone out  
Can't live with you, but I die without  
  
What's left to say when every word's been spoken?

Far from the madness, that folds around me  
Peaceful and gentle, like sails on the breeze  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
There's a warm light on a cold night  
And clean cotton sheets  
Soap smelling skin and tingling feet  
With stars lining the skyline  
And shine through the trees  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
And when the autumn comes down  
We'll get what we need from the town  
And all of our friends will be round  
  
In an old house on a hillside

Moon white as paper and night like asleep  
With old things behind us and new things to be  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
And when the sunshine comes down,  
My hair will turn golden  
And my skin will turn brown

With wisdom comes age  
With lessons come learning  
And pleasure comes with pain  
  
You can only have the sunshine after the rain  
  
I took a walk  
It got me thinking  
Left foot, right foot  
Smiling, blinking  
Breathe out, breathe in  
Somehow linking  
  
My soul to my mind and my heart to my mouth  
Lost and the found and the north to the south  
And the corners to the circle in my mind  
  
We may find that the gate has been locked  
When we come back down to what we really are  
Retrace the footprints off the path that is lost  
It's like trying to find a needle in the dark  
  
My hands they are empty  
But they are clean  
I'm poor but I'm healthy  
I'm halfway between  
The gutter and the skyline  
  
So I took a walk to the land's end  
Thinking about an ex-girlfriend that I had  
And the pages that I've turned  
And it seems to me  
That we all love the chase  
But once we're caught we feel encased  
Behind bars of love and trust  
Uprooted by drunken lust  
By people, people just like us  
People, people just like us  
  
You may find that the gate has been locked  
When we come back down to what we really are  
Retrace the footprints off the path that's been lost  
It's like trying to find a needle in the dark  
  
So I took a walk to the station  
Lost in my imagination  
Having private conversations with myself  
And I'm just stumbling around  
And I wait for the sound  
Of this crumbling town to come tumbling down  
People say I'm just bummin' around  
But I've had both my ears to the ground

Young and naive I never believed that love could be so well hid  
dWith regret I'm willing to bet and say the older you get  
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget  
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work  
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt  
You build your heart of plastic  
Get cynical and sarcastic  
And end up in the corner on your own  
  
'Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh no  
  
So what's the point in getting your hopes up  
When all you're ever getting is choked up  
When you're coked up  
And can't remember the reason why you broke up  
You call her in the morning  
When you're coming down and falling like an old man on the side of the road  
'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle  
When you're together you want to be single  
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss  
That made your heart tingle  
How much greener the grass is  
With those rose tinted glasses  
But the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our arses  
  
'Cause I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection  
I thought I was close but under further inspection  
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction  
There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection  
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection  
Cause all I want to do is try to make a connection  
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction oh oh  
  
Oh I'd love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection  
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection

From the first she must have known it  
  
But still she went on with him  
And she never once had shown it  
And she took him off the streets  
And she dried his tears of grievin'g  
  
She listened to his visions  
She believed in his believin'  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little  
  
He was a shooting star  
She was softer and more slowly  
He could not make things possible  
But, she could make them holy, holy...  
  
He was dancin' to some music  
No one else had ever heard  
He'd speak in unknown languages  
She'd translate every word  
  
And when the world was laughing  
At his castles in the sky  
She'd hold him in her body  
And he once again would fly

But, she could make them holy, holy...  
But she gave him a daughter  
And she gave him a son  
  
She was a mother, and a wife,  
And a lover when the day was done  
Well, he was too far gone for giving love  
What he'd offer in its stead  
  
Was the knowledge she was the only thing  
That was not in his head  
He took off East one morning  
In the rising sun's red glow  
  
She knew he was going nowhere  
But of course she let him go  
As she stood and watched him dwindle  
Much too empty to be sad  
  
He reappeared beside her and said,  
""You're all I've ever had""  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little

Pat Benatar,We Live For Love,/p/pat+benatar/we+live+for+love_20104795.html,"Your love's contagious, one kiss is dangerous  
But I have more to risk, than you to lose  
I feel passion growing  
I know that love is only just one inch away, from striking us  
We live for love  
We live for love  
  
When we get tired, and watch the summer fade away  
Will you think of romance, what will we do?  
Is there a place where we can go?  
Where time stands still for those who know?  
Till eternity we'll fulfill our desires  
  
We live for love  
We live for love  
We live for love  
We live for love  
  
I never planned to win the race  
But you convinced me face to face  
There was never a chance of losing at all  
  
We live for love  
We live for love  
We live for love  
We live for love  
  
We live for love  
We live for love  
We live for love...

And the thrill when we kiss  
Will be memories of paradise

And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight  
Is the hand I will hold

One silver thread

Like a ship in a bottle  
Held up to the sun  
Sails ain't going nowhere  
You can count every one  
Until it crashes unto the earth  
And simply slips away  
You can hide in the open  
Or just disappear  
  
Ours is just a craving  
And a twist of the wrist  
Will undo the stopper  
With abrupt tenderness  
Die little sparrow  
And awake  
Singing  
  
It all will come out fine

One common wire  
One silver thread

Patti Smith,Gung Ho,/p/patti+smith/gung+ho_20105245.html,"On a field of red one gold star  
Raised above his head  
Raised above his head  
He was not like any other  
He was just like any other  
And the song they bled  
Was a hymn to him  
  
Awake my little one  
The seed of revolution  
Sewn in the sleeve  
Of cloth humbly worn  
Where others are adorned  
  
Above the northern plain  
The great birds fly  
With great wings  
Over the paddy fields  
And the people kneel  
And the men they toil  
Yet not for their own  
And the children are hungry  
And the wheel groans  
  
There before a grass hut  
A young boy stood  
His mother lay dead  
His sisters cried for bread  
And within his young heart  
The seed of revolution sewn  
In cloth humbly worn  
While others are adorned  
  
And he grew into a man  
Not like any other  
Just like any other  
One small man  
A beard the color of rice  
A face the color of tea  
Who shared the misery  
Of other men in chains  
With shackles on his feet  
Escaped the guillotine  
  
Who fought against  
Colonialism imperialism  
Who remained awake  
While others slept  
Who penned like Jefferson  
Let independence ring  
And the cart of justice turns  
Slow and bitterly  
And the people were crying  
Plant that seed that seed  
And they crawled on their bellies  
Beneath the giant beast  
And filled the carts with bodies  
Where once had been their crops  
  
And the great birds swarm  
Spread their wings overhead  
And his mother dead  
And the typhoons and the rain  
The jungles in flames  
And the orange sun  
None could be more beautiful  
Than Vietnam  
Nothing was more beautiful  
Than Vietnam  
  
And his heart stopped beating  
And the wheel kept turning  
And the words he bled  
Were a hymn to them  
I have served the whole people  
I have served my whole country  
And as I leave this world  
May you suffer union  
And my great affection  
Limitless as sky  
Filled with golden stars  
  
The question is raised  
Raised above his head  
Was he of his word  
Was he a good man  
For his image fills the southern heart  
With none but bitterness  
  
And the people keep crying  
And the men keep dying  
And it's so beautiful  
So beautiful  
Give me one more turn  
Give me one more turn  
One more turn of the wheel  
  
One more revolution  
One more turn of the wheel

It makes me feel like rain.  
And like a fool who will never see the truth,  
I keep thinking something's gonna change.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And there's no way home  
When it's late at night and you're all alone.  
Are there things that you wanted to say?  
And do you feel me beside you in your bed,  
There beside you, where I used to lay?  
  
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much,  
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch.  
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are.  
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough.  
  
Baby, sometimes, love... It just ain't enough.  
Oh, Oh, Oh, No

On the soldiers by the side of the road  
There was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
It was a dry wind and it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth  
And the dead sand falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo

The way we look to a distant constellation

Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
It's a turn-around jump shot, it's everybody jump start  
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop chart  
Medicine is magical and magical is art  
Think of the Boy in the Bubble and the baby with the baboon heart  
And I believe there're lasers in the jungle  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere  
Staccato signals of constant information  
A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation

Oftentimes he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read  
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning""  
  
Oh, the leaves began to fallin' and the seas began to part  
And the people that confronted him were many  
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart

So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazed  
  
Dressed in black from head to toe  
Two guitars across our backs  
We would walk the city roads  
Seeking someone who would listen to the music  
That we were writing down at home  
  
But they can't take it from me, if they try  
I lived through those early days  
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazy

Like the pictures on the wall  
Of the local record shop  
Hearing noises we were destined to remember  
We willed the thrill to never stop  
  
May sweet memories of friends from the past  
Always come to you, when you look for them  
And your inspiration, long may it last  
May it comes to you time and time again  
  
Now everybody seems to have their own opinion  
Who did this and who did that  
But as for me I don't see how they can remember  
When they weren't where it was at

And where the other goes, the other goes

Are only paid in rupies  
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know  
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go

Who kept an extra layer  
Of dunlopillo mattress in his van

Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran  
Nobody does it like a famous groupie can

Who lived in Epping forest  
And all he ever wanted was to blow  
When the girls were with him  
He never lost his rhythm  
And nobody knows what the famous groupies know  
Nobody goes where the famous groupies go  
  
There was a classic story  
Of a roadic nicknamed Rory  
Who used to practice voodoo on the side  
When the famous twosome  
Suggested something gruesome  
All that they found was a crater two miles wide  
Which left the music business absolutely horrified  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of  
Female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their  
Global perambulations to the very boards of this  
Supremely magnificent proscenium arch - ladies and  
Gentlemen

I really knew you well what would your answer be?  
If you were here today.

Well knowing you,  
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart.  
If you were here today.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, here to-day.  
  
But as for me,  
I still remember how it was before,  
And I am holding back these tears no more.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh. I love you, ooh.  
  
What about the time we met?  
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get.  
Didn't understand a thing,  
But we could always sing.  
  
What about the night we cried,  
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside?  
Never understood a word,  
But you were always there - with a smile.  
  
And if I say,  
I really loved you and was glad you came along.  
If you were here today.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, for you were in my song.

Standing in the doorway of a little black shop  
Lifting up a pin light and ringing up a cop  
Running down the street  
Everybody sees  
What she's got is what she needs  
And what she loves is me

Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep  
Down to the church where just hours before  
Voices were singing and hands were beating  
And saying I won't be a slave any more.

Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark

He couldn't think of nothing at all  
He's not the same as you and me  
He doesn't dig poetry. He's so unhip that  
When you say Dylan, he thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas

Leaving all the yellow roses on her wedding cake  
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order

There is a moment, a chip in time  
When leaving home is the lesser crime  
When your eyes are blind with tears  
But your heart can see  
Another life, another galaxy  
  
That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow  
She hears the clouds  
She sees the eye of a hurricane  
As it sweeps across her island pillow

She bursted it out in crying

And Barbara in the new one

I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination  
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine  
  
But if I ever get back to the twentieth century  
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts  
Open the book of my vanishing memory  
With its catalogue of regrets  
Stand up for the deeds I did  
And those I didn't do  
Sit down, shut up, think about God  
And wait for the hour of my rescue  
  
We don't mean to mess things up  
But mess them up we do  
And then it's ""Oh, I'm sorry""  
Here's a smiling photograph of love it was new  
At a birthday party  
  
Make a wish and close your eyes: surprise, surprise, surprise.  
  
Early December, and brown as a sparrow  
Frost creeping over the pond  
I shoot a thought into the future  
And it flies like an arrow  
Through my lifetime, and beyond  
  
If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow  
Or even the wind-blown dust  
Find me on the ancient road in the song when the wires are hushed  
Hurry on and remember me, as I'll remember you  
Far above the golden clouds, the darkness vibrates  
  
The earth is blue  
  
And everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it

Brushes your thigh

A shadow in the family  
The baby waves bye-bye  
I'm trying, I'm flying

July.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you be a Christian? How can you be a Jew? How can you be a Muslim, a
Buddhist, a Hindu?  
How can you?  
Weak as the winter sun, we enter life on earth. Names and religion come just
after date of birth. Then everybody gets a tongue to speak, and everyone hears
an inner voice. A day at the end of the week to wonder and rejoice.  
If the answer is infinite light, why do we sleep in the dark?  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you tattoo your body? Why do you cover your head? How can you eat from a
rice bowl, the holy man only breaks bread?  
We watched the fireworks, 'til they were fireflies. Followed a path of stars,
over the endless skies.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth?

Make it up and write it down

About Goldilocks and the three bears  
Nature in the cross hairs  
And how we all ascended  
From the deep green sea  
When it's not too hot  
Not too cold  
Not too meek  
Not too bold  
Where it's just right and you have sunlight  
Then we're home,  
Finally home  
Home in the land of the homeless  
Finally home  
  
Oh what are we going to do  
I never did a thing to you  
Time peaceful as a hurricane eye  
Peaceful as a hurricane eye  
  
A history of whispers  
A shadow of a horse  
Faces painted black in sorrow and remorse  
White cloud, black crow  
Crucifix and arrow  
The oldest silence speaks the loudest  
Under the deep green sea  
  
When speech becomes a crime  
Silence leads the spirit  
Over the bridge of time  
  
Over the bridge of time  
I'm walking with my family  
And the road begins to climb  
And it's oh Lord how we going to pray  
With crazy angel voices  
All night  
Until it's a new day  
  
Peaceful as a hurricane  
Peaceful as a hurricane  
Peaceful as a hurricane eye  
Peaceful as a hurricane  
Peaceful as a hurricane  
Peaceful as a hurricane eye

How does it make you feel?  
You want to be a writer  
But you don't know how or when  
Find a quiet place  
Use a humble pen  
  
You want to talk talk talk about it  
All night squawk about  
The ocean and the atmosphere  
Well I've been away for a long time  
And it looks like a mess around here  
I'll be away for a long time  
So here's how the story goes  
There was an old woman  
Who lived in a shoe  
She was baking a cinnamon pie  
She fell asleep in a washing machine  
Woke up in a hurricane eye

They'd never fight again  
  
And when the papers all were signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands end bowed their heads  
And grateful prayers were prayed  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing round and round  
And guns and swords and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground

Of a cappella groups, yeah  
Singing late in the evening

Then I learned to play some lead guitar  
I was underage in this funky bar  
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""  
And when I come back to the room  
And everybody just seemed to move  
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play  
And it was late in the evening  
And I blew that room away!

When you came into my life  
I said ""I'm gonna get that girl

Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance  
Everybody thinks it's true  
  
Two disappointed believers  
Two people playing the game  
Negotiations and love songs  
Are often mistaken for one and the same  
  
Now the man and the woman they remain in contact  
Let us say it's for the child  
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract  
Conversations hard and wild  
  
But from time to time he makes her laugh  
She cooks a meal of two  
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance  
Everybody thinks it's true  
  
What is the point of this story  
What information pertains  
The thought that life could be better  
Is woven indelibly  
Into our hearts and our brains

By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere  
And he walked his days  
Under African skies

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein  
After the dream of falling and calling your name out  
These are the roots of rhythm  
And the roots of rhythm remain  
  
In early memory  
Mission music  
Was ringing 'round my nursery door  
I said take this child, Lord  
From Tucson Arizona  
Give her the wings to fly through harmony  
And she won't bother you no more

All the favorite melodies

Stationed in Newport news  
She was a high school queen  
With nothing left to lose

Exchanging with ease

Serious numbers are eager to please  
  
Take my address  
Take my phone  
Call me if you can  
Here's my address  
Here's my phone  
Please don't give it to some madman  
Hey hey, whoa whoa  
Complicated life  
Numbers swirling thick and curious  
You can cut them with a knife  
You can cut them with a knife  
  
Two times two is twenty-two  
Four times four is forty-four  
When numbers get serious  
They leave a mark on your door  
Urgent! Urgent!  
A telephone ringing in the hallways  
When times are mysterious  
Serious numbers will speak to us always  
  
That is why a man with numbers  
Can put your mind at ease  
We've got numbers by the trillions  
Here and overseas  
Hey hey, whoa whoa  
Look at the stink about Japan  
All those numbers waiting patiently  
Don't you understand?  
Don't you understand?  
  
So wrap me  
Wrap me  
Wrap me do  
In the shelter of your arms  
I am ever your volunteer  
I won't do you any harm  
I will love you innumerably  
You can count on my word  
When times are mysterious  
Serious numbers will always be heard

And the numbers all come home  
The four rolls into three  
The three turns into two  
And the two becomes a  
One

Not recalling the plan  
Was it?...  
  
He was okay  
But wondering  
About wandering  
Was it age?  
By consequence?  
Or was he moved sleight of hand?  
  
Mondays were made to fall  
Lost on a road he knew by heart  
It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly  
Sometimes he hid in his radio  
Watching others pull into their homes  
While he was drifting  
  
On a line  
Of his own  
Off the line  
Off the side  
By the by  
As dirt turned to sand  
As if moved by sleight of hand  
  
When he reached the shore of his clip-on world  
He resurfaced to the norm  
Organized his few things, his coat and keys  
Any new realizations would have to wait  
Till he had more time  
More time  
  
A time to dream  
To himself  
He waves goodbye  
To himself  
I'll see you on the other side  
Another man moved by sleight of hand

On the day that you were born,  
The angels got together,  
An' decided to create a dream come true  
  
So they sprinkled mood dust in your hair of gold  
An' starlight in your eyes of blue  
  
That is why, all the boys in town,

to be constant as the stars above,  
every soldier knows she's kept her promise,  
and she has been faithful to her love!

You've got to want to give to get it  
Or you could land up  
In the same suspicious hell  
It's happened before, it's happened before  
Coincidence and patience  
Will mend this fatal flaw  
Though it may seem a long wait  
Others have been here  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
One day when the phone starts ringing  
You'll answer to the words  
You're longing for  
No tears no trade no prison cell  
Whatever you need  
He will return more  
It's happened before, it's happened before

Pet Shop Boys,Being Boring,/p/pet+shop+boys/being+boring_20107138.html,"I came across a cache of old photos  
And invitations to teenage parties  
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations  
From someone's wife, a famous writer  
In the nineteen-twenties  
When you're young you find inspiration  
In anyone who's ever gone  
And opened up a closing door  
She said: ""We were never feeling bored  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end""  
  
When I went I left from the station  
With a haversack and some trepidation  
Someone said: ""If you're not careful  
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for  
In the nineteen-seventies""  
But I sat back and looking forward  
My shoes were high and I had scored  
I'd bolted through a closing door  
I would never find myself feeling bored  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that, looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  
  
Now I sit with different faces  
In rented rooms and foreign places  
All the people I was kissing  
Some are here and some are missing  
In the nineteen-nineties  
I never dreamt that I would get to be  
The creature that I always meant to be  
But I thought in spite of dreams  
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring

Pet Shop Boys,It Doesn't Often Snow At Christmas,/p/pet+shop+boys/it+doesnt+often+snow+at+christmas_20480799.html,"Christmas is not all it's cracked up to be  
Families fighting around a plastic tree  
Nothing on the TV that you'd want to see  
And it's hardly ever snowing  
  
The way it's meant to be  
Like in White Christmas year after year  
Bing Crosby, Bring Crosby  
Are you listening to me?  
  
It doesn't often snow at Christmas  
The way it's meant to do  
But I'll still have a glow at Christmas  
Because I'll be with you  
  
The Christmas message was long ago lost  
Now it's all about shopping and how much things cost  
It's meant to be goodwill as well as synthetic fun  
And what this is this year's festive number one  
  
It doesn't often snow at Christmas  
The way it's meant to do  
But I'll still have a glow at Christmas  
Because I'll be with you

And disappointment disappears over night  
  
Say that love is an impossible dream

Relax, what you see is what you've seen  
What you get, is a new philosophy

Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama  
With realism on the sparsest of sets  
Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion  
No happy endings but a message to depress  
Saying life is an impossible scheme  
That's the point of this philosophy  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
But if is wasn't, and isn't were  
You can't be sure, but you might find ecstasy  
  
(Oh no)  
  
Just for the sake of it, make sure you're always frowning  
(Get, get, get)  
It shows the world that you've got substance and depth  
You know, life is an impossible scheme  
And love an imperceptible dream

Now I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

For some reason I can't explain  
I know St. Peter won't call my name

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

At keeping its humanity repressed

Too many questions, not enough answers  
  
Then I laid eyes on you  
I knew right there and then  
This would be more than a passing encounter  
My fate is bound to yours  
I've found a cause right here  
  
And if this is the last place God made  
And yours is the last face I see  
Just feeling close to you  
That's good enough for me  
  
We've seen the best of times  
We've seen the worst of times  
Been through hell and high water together  
Diamond bright and tear stained mem'ries

Without a care for the why or the wherefore  
I will be there for you

Stranded starfish have no place to hide  
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide  
There's no point in direction we cannot  
Even choose a side.  
  
I took the old track  
The hollow shoulder, across the waters  
On the tall cliffs  
They were getting older, sons and daughters  
The jaded underworld was riding high  
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky  
And as the nail sunk in the cloud, the rain  
Was warm and soaked the crowd.  
  
Lord, here comes the flood  
We'll say goodbye to flesh and blood  
If again the seas are silent  
In any still alive  
It'll be those who gave their island to survive  
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry.  
  
When the flood calls  
You have no home, you have no walls  
In the thunder crash  
You're a thousand minds, within a flash  
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see  
The actors gone, there's only you and me  
And if we break before the dawn, they'll  
Use up what we used to be.

Took the cash went down the casino, down on the wheel on the double

Bought myself a country house with an antique carved oak door

But there ain't much heart inside here  
Not like the start  
I was good at the art of survival  
I've always tried  
To keep my troubles deep inside  
Where I can hide them  
now I'm open wide  
  
When it ends  
Again I'll see my friends  
They'll give me a lift  
I've been running adrift, so easy  
Shifting the gear  
I got nothing to fear from the showdown  
I'll go down quiet  
And kids downstairs making a hell of a din  
I'm all alone  
Getting a quote for the wages of sin  
  
Beyond the indigo, indigo  
Where the chilly winds, winds will blow  
My time is running low  
Going to cross the dark dark river  
Going to see my good life-giver  
Better cover my yellow liver  
  
Alright,  
I'm giving up the fight  
I didn't know when  
I'd be a stranger again  
In my own land  
The days are O.K.  
But oh how I hate those long nights  
You understand  
Darling please, just hold my hand  
You feel so warm  
In the eye of the storm  
I'm going away, I'm going away, I'm going away  
See you again someday  
Darling, I'm going away  
Feel like I'm going away, this time I'm going away

Peter Gabriel,The Story Of Ovo,/p/peter+gabriel/the+story+of+ovo_20329166.html,"A long time ago, in a far away land  
Theo was the man who learned  
To understand the riches of the earth  
And all that it was worth  
The first man that ever tried to stand with his own plan  
Now this man was all about the wind rain and trees  
He knew that it would take care  
Of all of his family needs  
OVO  
  
Now Ion was the son who spent his nights and days  
Looking for all kinds of ways to get his father's praise  
In all daddy's ways he just wanted to impress  
Bigger, faster, stronger is what he tried to stress  
  
Sofia was the girl  
Living in her own world  
She found love and joy with a young sky boy  
Sky boys were seen as less to the rest  
So it would seem  
Sofia went into the woods to daydream  
With love in her eyes  
Her own father would despise  
Her love for the young sky boy he would destroy  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
When Theo was gone, his son Ion took the power  
And in his daddy's name, built the biggest strongest tower  
The earth people and sky people divided by machines  
And the ones who had nothing  
Were the ones who had the wings  
  
The sky boy just wanted everything to be equal  
From full-time lover  
To now fighting for his people  
OVO  
  
Now Beth was the mom  
Who really loved to weave  
She couldn't believe her own son would decieve  
The sky people got hungry  
And their welfare was ignored  
She let them in the tower  
And the bloody battle roared  
Down came Ion  
And the tower fell as well  
The dark days were over  
And the sky people's hell  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
Sofia and the sky boy had long been kept apart  
Sofia grief was faded  
It was joy that filled her heart  
Wrapped in his loving wings  
Sofia took her man  
So the earth and sky united  
It was all father's plan  
OVO  
  
Theo kept an acorn  
Sofia had carefully saved  
It was planted in the ground that her brother had once paved  
With a rustling and a creaking  
An unearthly sound  
Something big started growing right out of the fertile ground  
  
It was the biggest tree that any of the people ever seen  
And it covered up the sky with a layer of leafy green  
Then it rained and it rained  
And they watched the waters rise  
Then Sofia led her people  
To the safety of the skies  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
She climbed and she climbed  
But never giving up  
So pregnant and exhausted  
Finally made it to the top  
She looked into the sky  
And the world began to turn  
And with a single cry a new baby had arrived  
  
With OVO in his nest, everyone one had done their best  
To prepare for the world  
And every single test  
Soon he was blessed  
And as his mother stood by  
He was soon released  
And sailed off into the sky  
OVO

Peter Tosh,Johnny B Goode,/p/peter+tosh/johnny+b+goode_20224245.html,"Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville  
Back up in the woods, on top of a hill  
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
He never learned to read or write so well  
But he could play his guitar like ringin' a bell yell  
Said go, go Johnny!  
Johnny be good tonight!  
Said go, go Johnny!  
Johnny B. Goode...  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Sit beneath a tree in the railroad track  
Old engineer in the train sittin' in the shade  
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by would stop and say:  
""Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play""  
Said go, go Johnny!  
Johnny be good tonight!  
Said go, go Johnny!  
Johnny B. Goode...  
Mama said: ""Son, you gotta be a man,  
You got to be the leader of a reggae band  
People comin' in from miles around  
To hear you play until the sun goes down  
Boy, someday your name will be in the lights  
Sayin' JOHNNY - JOHNNY B. GOODE TONITE""  
I said go, go Johnny!

Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year  
But you should guess who's in insanity chair

It's one thing to lie about your didgits  
It's one thing to say that you live it

Just reaching past the goal in front of me

All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

Young faces hide in the shadows,  
While they watch their mother and father fight

And the brother shrugs to his sister and says  
Looks like it's just us from now on'

Be sure, before we close our eyes  
Don't walk away from here  
'Til you hear both sides  
  
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm  
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn  
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets  
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall

You could've tried to see the difference between us  
But it seemed too far for you to go.  
  
Do you remember?  
  
Through all of my life  
In spite of all the pain  
You know people are funny sometimes  
Cause they just can't wait  
To get hurt again  
  
Do you remember?  
  
There are things we won't recall  
Feelings we'll never find  
It's taken so long to see it  
Cause we never seemed to have the time  
  
There was always something more important to do  
More important to say  
But ""I love you"" wasn't one of those things  
And now it's too late  
  
Do you remember?

You know some things are best left unspoken  
And some things just never work out  
And sometimes, seems you try and you try and whatever you do  
There's a fix that you're in, and you just can't get out  
He said, ""I need your help, I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on""

I knew that something was wrong  
But he still had his pride  
He'd tell me in time  
Well this feeling inside  
Kept eating at me  
I was losing a friend, and I had to know why  
  
When I heard the voice on the phone, I knew it was bad news  
So I rushed to be by his side  
And we said goodbye for the last time  
I gently hugged him, and kissed him goodbye  
He whispered, ""I need your help, I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on. ""  
  
We were always laughing  
I just remember laughing, mama  
We were always laughing  
  
Oh I need your help, I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on  
  
Though as time goes by, and it all becomes clear  
We can see the deceit, we see the lies  
So I asked myself, over and over, and over again  
What did they know? What did they hide?  
Fools, leading the innocent blindly  
Fools, turning away  
  
And I know that  
When I think of my friend with that look in his eyes  
And if they told the truth, he might be here today  
I need your help, I need it now  
Just give me the strength to go on, on

And if you lost your love for me  
You never let it show  
There was no way to compromise  
So now we're living  
Now we're living separate lives  
Ooh, it's so difficult  
Love leads to isolation  
So you build that wall  
You build that wall  
Yes you build that wall  
Oh yes, you build that wall  
And you make it stronger  
You have no right to ask me how I feel  
You have no right to speak to me so kind  
Some day I might  
I just might find myself looking in your eyes  
But for now,  
We'll go on living separate lives  
Yes for now,  
We'll go on living separate lives  
Separate lives...  
Separate lives...

I won't give up, I'll wait for you  
'Til you come back, it's all I can do  
I'll be right here, I'm going nowhere without you  
Give me the chance, just make the call  
Just say the words, I'm waiting for  
Just let this heart of mine show you  
It only beats for you  
  
Yes it only beats for you  
It only beats for you  
This love, this heart  
These arms, they're only for you  
This love, this heart  
These arms, they're only for you  
They're only for you

Phil Collins,Thru These Walls,/p/phil+collins/thru+these+walls_20108029.html,"I can hear through these walls  
I can hear it when they're foolin' around  
I can hear through these walls  
And I hear every sign, every sound  
I can hear through these walls  
In the dark with the shades pulled down  
  
Every word that they say  
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way  
  
My favorite moment  
Putting the glass up next to the wall  
Imagination  
Tho' I see nothing, I hear it all  
Putting my sign up  
Do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out  
Oh mind my clothes, they're all laid out  
  
I can see through my windows  
I can see the girls and the boys  
I can see through my windows  
And I can imagine the noise  
I can see through my windows  
I can see them playing with toys  
  
Oh I hope it won't end  
If I promise not to touch, just be a friend  
  
Life is so lonely  
I don't get high off just being me  
I like pretending  
Wanting to touch them, wanting to see  
It's only normal  
Creeping behind you, now don't shout, 'cos it's alright  
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight  
  
Oh I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage  
No way in, no way out, and it gets so lonely  
Am I really asking a lot  
Just to reach out and touch somebody  
'Cos when I look through my windows or open my door  
I can feel it all around me  
  
I can hear through these walls  
I can hear it when they're foolin' around  
I can hear through these walls  
And I hear every sight, every sound  
I can hear through these walls  
In the dark with the shades pulled down  
  
Every word that they say  
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way  
  
Ah yeah.

Phil Collins,We Wait And We Wonder,/p/phil+collins/we+wait+we+wonder_20107970.html,"'To the outsider it seems that we in Britain  
Live daily under the cloud of terrorism.  
That familiarity sometimes makes you think of it as almost normal  
Then suddenly something will happen'  
  
We stand, hang our heads disbelieving  
Then not knowing how could such a thing be wrong  
We wonder just what they must be thinking  
To take a life of one so young  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How far must we go, to prove to you?  
  
We wait and we wonder how this happened  
Killing the old, the innocent, the young  
While sons follow in fathers footsteps not understanding  
That what they do could somehow be so wrong  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How far must we go, to prove to you?  
  
So we will wait and we'll wonder  
  
No regrets, no forgiveness, no compassion  
These brave heroes only know to hit and run  
Slowly my sadness turns to rage and we wonder  
How can these scars ever heal, when all is said and done  
  
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?  
How many tears must fall to prove to you?  
Please tell me, when will it be over now, how soon?  
And how far must they go, to prove to you?  
  
So we wait and we wonder

Phil Collins,Why Can't It Wait 'till Morning,/p/phil+collins/why+cant+it+wait+till+morning_20108021.html,"Why can't it wait 'til morning?  
We can talk about it then  
'Cause I've had a drink too many  
And my troubles, well I ain't got any  
  
Why can't it wait 'til daylight?  
Things will seem much clearer then  
I'm tired and my eyes are weary  
And I just want you lying here with me  
  
So close your eyes  
I'll make it oh, so nice  
  
Well I don't wanna think about what we've said  
And I don't wanna know why we hurt ourselves  
'Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me  
It'll take care of itself and I wanna sleep  
  
So why can't it wait 'til next time?  
'Cause that time may never come  
Stay here with your arms around me  
You're going nowhere without me  
  
So close your eyes  
I'll make it oh, so nice for you
