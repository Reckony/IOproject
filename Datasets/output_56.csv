Venom,Wolverine,/v/venom/wolverine_20533684.html,"Deep in the dark of the forest came calls of sound from the wolverine  
As they danced their wicked dance round the fire in a dead trance  
Raising the chalice to the night darkly seek to their own delight  
Sacrifice to the only son saving blood sip it one by one  
Cleansing the altar awaiting the prize the virgin clad whiter than snow  
Holding the mass and presenting the cross pointed inverted below  
Doubles the blade in the cold and blessed night holds it above to be marked  
Hammering down in the soft flesh below ripping and tearing the heart  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take the prize we deliver to the gate  
Cloven the demons cloak ascends from the earth this being never ends  
As they fall to their knees and prey as the night reimburse the day  
Colder than any mortal thing his hands stretch to infinity  
All encompassing the flock there's no life in here any more  
Deeper than hades he brings to his side the man who presented the mass  
Questioning nothing the high priest is drawn kneels to his master's request  
Talking his left hand and passing it slow he ponders the mortal before  
Swiftly he moves and faster than hell he tears out this lunatics soul  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take the prize we deliver to the gate  
Cleansing the altar awaiting the prize the virgin clad whiter than snow  
Holding the mass and presenting the cross pointed inverted below  
Doubles the blade in the cold and blessed night holds it above to be marked  
Hammering down in the soft flesh below ripping and tearing the heart  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take this prize we deliver to the gate  
Deep in the dark of the forest came calls of sound from the wolverine

Venom,"Women,leather And Hell",/v/venom/women+leather+and+hell_20344474.html,"Stand aside, loose your pride  
I'm at the gates alone  
Sourcery, blasphemy  
All welcome in my home  
I'm leaving  
But soon I'm coming back  
Believe me  
I'm hot on your tracks  
Through the night  
Eagles flight  
The Angels kiss my brow  
Tempting me with studded heels  
The bitch is in heat now  
Oh you've got me  
That leather smells so sweet  
I'm on fire  
Breeding sin, breathing lust  
Witches spell ohhh...  
Women Leather and Hell  
Go for it  
Come on turn that mother up  
Dynamite, is right on time  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Destiny won't catch me  
The choice of death is mine  
Salvation is keeping out of sight  
Damnation is joining in the fight

Vera Lynn,Harbor Lights,/v/vera+lynn/harbor+lights_20218093.html,"I saw the harbor lights

The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me  
I watched the harbor lights  
How could I help if tears were starting  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whispering  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

By the barrack gate  
Darling I remember  
The way you used to wait  
'Twas there that you whispered tenderly  
That you loved me  
You'd always be  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Time would come for roll call  
Time for us to part  
Darling I'd caress you  
And press you to my heart  
And there neath that far off lantern light  
I'd hold you tight  
We'd kiss good night  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Orders came for sailing  
Somewhere over there  
All confined to barracks  
'Twas more than I could bear  
I knew you were waiting in the street  
I heard your feet  
But could not meet  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Resting in our billet  
Just behind the line  
Even though we're parted  
Your lips are close to mine  
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed  
Your sweet face seems  
To haunt my dreams  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene.

Or uncommon hearts  
That makes us insincere

Love is just my fantasy disguised

And love without a dream it will not survive

I am lucky just to have a heart

And lonely tears can only hope to freeze  
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down  
  
And so our sun is sinking low  
And your spirit's close behind

When will you share your winter nights

And the sky was falling just to make it worse

Shaking, crying  
Hating lying to myself

He was sitting alone in the rain  
I said hey young man what you doing there  
And he said sir I'm going insane  
He said sir I'm going insane  
  
You see I love an American beauty  
But nobody here understands  
Then he looked to the sky with resentment in his eyes  
And said Lord why am I in Japan  
Oh Lord why am I in Japan  
  
Then he told me a story about yesterday  
When he walked in the search of a friend  
But nobody came to his rescue  
And he came to his bitter end  
  
He pulled me close and said they all stopped and stared  
As I walked down the street all alone  
Nobody knew my name  
Nobody knew my name  
  
I said young man I know where you're going  
And young man I know where you've been  
For I've been in this land for a lifetime it seems  
And I'm never to come back again  
No I'm never to come back again  
  
So I turned and I gave him my blessing  
And I left him alone in the rain  
But I had to just stop and laugh at myself  
Still nobody knows my name  
  
Nobody knows my name  
  
Still nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
My name, yeah yeah

Won't you take the time to explain  
Do you ever think you'd rather be with me instead  
Or do you only think about me when it rains  
  
We shared some special nights together  
We said we'd watch the morning rise  
But when the sun was all around us  
Wasn't nothing I hadn't seen in your eyes  
  
I try so hard to keep it hidden  
But I am hurting deep inside

There are two times that I have cried

I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain

Hope we get into a bit of a groove with it  
  
Get back, get back again and again  
I've been here since I can remember when  
My life is a boat, being blown by you  
With nothing ahead, just the deepest blue...  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
  
Come back, come back again and again,

There ain't nothing left to say  
When I will get you alone

Maybe you know it's true

In every sky, in every kiss  
There's something that I might have missed  
Why am I going to  
A place that now belongs to you  
But you were weak and so was I  
Let's pick it up, let's even try  
To live today, so why not smile  
Don't dream away your life 'Cause it is mine  
Is that a crime, is that a crime, this life is mine

The house was deathly quiet  
I knew something was wrong  
Then suddenly it dawned on me  
The cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
Oh, I sat and cried for hours  
And I tried to clear my head  
I even went and laid back down  
On her side of the bed  
Her perfume lingered on the sheets  
Our love once laid upon  
Her memory's destroying me  
In the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely

John Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded Love  
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove  
  
Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew  
But in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flew  
I practiced and I practiced til I got it right  
Packed up everything and just took off one night  
  
I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage  
He said the only difference is what you're gettin' paid  
He didn't care that everybody knew my name  
He said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the same  
  
But when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky one  
He's walkin' hand in hand in hand with God's only son  
My faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right  
But I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight  
  
And I will honor my father with these words I write down  
As long as I remember him he'll always be around  
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife  
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life

An anti-militarist

A fly in rage

A uniform or blood  
That woman has seduced me  
And now I am done for  
Darling, where shall I  
Hide you in a hurry?  
Here is Agamemnon  
Here is Agamemnon  
I am coming  
Directly from the trenches  
And look forward  
To a solemn luncheon  
Oh, my nerves  
I'm losing my find  
This damned telephone  
Spoils my favorite position  
And no I can start  
Writing poetry again

Anxious, Weary, my Mind wracked by Fears unnatural I Scan The Horizon  
Watching, hoping for Signs of the Signal Fire  
Great Gift of Prometheus, reward me with the news that Troy has  
Finally Fallen!  
It is She who commands me thus to remain upon this Palace roof  
Watching, waiting... that willful, calculating Woman, who plots  
And Schemes, like a King!!!  
No sleep, no Dreams, only Fear descends upon my couch and Ravages  
My Heart  
Yes Sorrow and Fear for what's become of this House  
Once so Great, now lost and cold, Hungry Spirits stalk these Halls  
But still I'll keep my Faith and Pray for our release from all  
This suffering...  
Look there... at last... Conquest! Great Blaze of Triumph,  
I Greet thee, I Honour thee most Welcome Visitor from the Depths  
Of the Night  
Rape the Sky like a Royal Sun, turn this Mournful Night into  
Shining Day!  
Awake Queen of Agamemnon, rise from thy sleep  
Cry the Morning Song of Victory, for the Kingdom of Ilion has Fallen  
The God of Fire proclaims it so  
We'll reap this Harvest of Flame, give Thanks and Pay Tribute  
To the Deities that made us...  
Oh let it be so, let our Fleet return in Honour  
Over Lord Poseidon?s Sea, safe from Wind and Storm  
Let me stand before my King and Pledge him Sword and Life for his Glory  
A Thorn grips my voice, no more from me now  
Yet if this House could speak what a Tale it could tell  
Of Savage Murder, Betrayal, Ravenous Feasting and a Daimon with an  
Unquenchable thirst for Blood and Torn Flesh!!!  
No, no more from me, let actions speak! AWAKE!!!

Chain the earth and chain the sun  
Break the hourglass  
Make the stars fall into line

And I'll rage against this wind  
For even a moment more of the day

A thousand lips to taste  
The darkness breathes a hateful sigh  
Goes forth to murder dreams  
Voices crying cold and dark  
My name is in the sky  
Shadows lenghten, sun sinks low  
The trees are frozen gold  
I won't give in!!!

Wielding the signs of grace, the signs of faith

We fear no evil  
Helped by hands unseen  
With a voice, like the wind  
Seven trumpets sound the chords of dreams, now  
  
In mountain caverns deep, the molten flames would leap.  
The virgin metal was thrust in the forge  
Its power works for those  
Whose dreams of peace still hold  
The skies rejoice the coming day.  
  
Gonna shout, gonna scream  
The stacks of glory, sweetly sing their praise  
Gonna shout, gonna scream, shake the world  
And let them know we're here.

The evils of the innocent  
A face of wonder, a heart will cry  
The stain of death upon her eyes  
A moment caught in time

Do you hear my Van Gogh's cry?  
Will it be my brother's purchase?  
Even only when I die? Even only when I die  
  
Why should I change for anyone?  
Why should my chains break or come undone?  
And I'll sing glory hallelujah I'm coming home  
Baby don't rescue me, don't rescue me  
'Cause I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be

In the sky and baby on the ground  
High as the sun, deep as the sea  
Rain has been falling all over me  
I want to live in harmony  
I know what I need to be free

And the love I feel

If I compromise, I'd be living lies

And I know that he'll be waiting

Why do the birds go on singing?  
Why do the stars glow above?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world  
It ended when I lost your love.  
I wake up in the morning and I wonder  
Why everything's the same as it was.  
I can't understand, no I can't understand  
How life goes on the way it does  
Why does my heart go on beating?  
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

A shoulder chipped and a head for crime  
He was destined to be broken  
She found a diamond in a coal mine  
What she saw in him was a crooked line  
She just wanted him to straighten  
  
She said truth lies underneath the radical light  
Show you what you need, what you're looking for  
One night underneath the radical light  
She said once you see the truth you'll be wanting more  
  
She doesn't know why she's got the desire  
To lead this boy out of the burning fire  
Call it love or call it mercy  
See, one night she was dreamin'  
She saw a man who looked just like him,  
He said ""When you find me baby set me free""  
  
We can shine standin' in the radical light  
Take a chance and find your vision  
We can feel fine walkin' in the radical light  
It all comes down to radical decisions  
  
I feel your sorrow  
I know you're afraid to let it go  
There's always tomorrow  
Come into the light you don't have to be alone anymore

Show me, real truth, real love  
Wake me, hold me tonight  
Under the radical light  
Show me, the real truth, real life  
Under the radical light  
  
Someday we will be one

Album: Twenty Four Seven (99)  
  
Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that I'm stronger without you  
And that I'll never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder

Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Don't try to take me to a disco  
You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul

At the speed of sound you don't see the ground  
And in your sports car with the windows down  
And the radio on and you don't stop talking  
Thanks, I'll keep walking  
I'm doing things in my own way  
Well I'm doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes it's own way  
At the speed of life  
A man lives in the city  
Distracted by the news  
From sitting down with the ones he loves  
Or taking time to choose  
And what of conversation?  
And what is left when he dies?  
Is there a diary of an honest man  
To stand against the lies?  
Repeat chorus  
I'm doing things for their own sake  
A picture on a screen won't do  
I need to feel and touch it too  
Do what I feel  
I'm doing things for their own sake  
I gotta find that essential, deep emotion  
Get unhooked from this low commotion  
And do what I feel  
I'm doing things in my own way  
I'm doing things in my own way  
Well I'm doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes it's own way  
At the speed of life  
This is the speed of life

This memory I'll keep of bitter crimson  
Winter sunrise lost in the icy silence  
Our warm breath fading in the air  
I'm not sure why I tell you, still less what I mean  
It's like a dream and maybe there's no cause  
But in the end it's  
What you can give to someone  
How you can help to set them free

Big world we've got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right

Get us through the night  
This world is wounded now and we inflict  
The pain  
We have to change our lives and think again  
'Cause in the end it's  
All that we're sure we're made of  
All that we know to set us free

An unknown sea  
I'd either swim or I'd drown  
Or just keep falling down and down

War broke out between the states  
And they joined up with Quantrill  
And it was over in Clay county  
That Frank and Jesse finally learned to kill  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the rivers and the range  
Keep on riding, riding, riding Frank and Jesse James  
After Appomattox they were on the loosing side  
So no amnesty was granted  
And as outlaws they did ride  
They rode against the railroads,  
And they rode against the banks  
And they rode against the governor  
Never did they ask for a word of thanks  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the prairies and the plains  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Robert Ford, a gunman  
Did exchange for his parole  
Took the life of James the outlaw  
Which he snuck up on and stole  
No one knows just where they came to be misunderstood  
But the poor Missouri farmers knew  
Frank and Jesse do the best they could  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the rivers and the range  
Keep on riding, riding, riding

Mr. Bones Music Inc. Publishing BMI  
Softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again  
And I sit and sing my song  
'Though it never seems to matter  
And it never fills the emptiness inside  
Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air  
While someone waits for someone to come somewhere  
No one waits for me  
'Cause I thought I wanted to be free  
Now I'm wondering why I said goodbye  
Looking through my window  
At the dark and troubled sky  
I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by  
And I turn away  
From today  
To where we used to lie  
And I cry  
Yes, I cry  
And I cry  
While softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again

Most of all I'm sorry if I made you blue  
I'm betting the gorilla will, too  
  
They say Jesus will find you wherever you go  
But when He'll come looking for you, they don't know  
In the mean time, keep your profile low  
Gorilla, you're a desperado  
  
He built a house on an acre of land  
He called it 'Villa Gorilla Now'  
I hear he's getting divorced  
Laying low at L'Ermitage, of course  
  
Then the ape grew very depressed  
Went through Transactional Analysis  
He plays racquetball and runs in the rain  
Still he's shackled to a platinum chain

I'd leave the change and tuck the bills inside my cummerbund  
I got a part-time job at my father's carpet store  
Laying tactless stripping and housewives by the score  
I loaded up their furniture and took it to Spokane  
Auctioned off every last Naugahyde divan  
I'm very well acquainted with the seven deadly sins  
I keep a busy schedule trying to fit them in  
I'm proud to be a glutton and I don't have time for sloth  
I'm greedy and I'm angry and I don't care who I cross  
[CHORUS]  
I'm, intruder in the dirt  
I like to have a good time and I don't care who gets hurt  
I'm, take a look at me  
I'll live to be a hundred and go down in history  
Of course I went to law school and got a law degree  
And counseled all my clients to plead insanity  
Then worked in hair replacement swindling the bald  
Where very few are chosen, fewer still are called  
Then on to Monte Carlo play chemin de fer  
I threw away the fortune I made transplanting hair  
I put my last few francs down on a prostitute  
Who took me up to her room to perform the flag salute  
Whereupon I stole her passport and her wig  
And headed for the airport and the midnight flight, you dig?  
Fourteen hours later I was down in Adelaide  
Looking through the want ads sipping Foster's in the shade  
I opened up an agency somewhere down the line  
To hire aboriginals to work the opal mines  
But I attached their wages and took a whopping cut  
And whisked away their workman's comp and pauperized the lot  
[CHORUS]  
I bought a first class ticket on Malaysian Air  
Landed in Sri Lanka none the worse for wear  
I'm thinking of retiring from all my dirty deals  
See you in the next life, wake me up for meals

Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight

With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done  
The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day  
So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray  
  
Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war  
With their fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore  
For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees  
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese  
  
Roland the Thompson gunner...  
  
His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest  
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best  
So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead  
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner  
Norway's bravest son  
Time, time, time  
For another peaceful war  
But time stands still for Roland  
'Til he evens up the score  
They can still see his headless body stalking through the night  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
  
Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in  
He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin  
Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word  
But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg

Waterboys,Let It Happen,/w/waterboys/let+it+happen_20145411.html,"Such a sad procession  
Winding down the lane  
What a strange impression

A band was playing endless mindless  
It was like a hooligan's lament  
It was dumb but it was timeless  
I still wonder what it meant  
  
But whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be

Grace is effected over me  
  
""Behold the lights of London""  
The skipper said as his hands shook,  
His aura eaten by his jealousy  
And all the drugs he took  
He said ""This is the real world, Buddy  
  
Toughen up your ass or it'll break""  
I said ""I'm not your buddy, Buddy  
And your real world is a fake""

The D.J. took his vengeance  
As the weeding guests arrive  
  
There was malice in his handshake,  
Quicksand in his eyes  
As he slunk across the courtyard  
From far-off I heard a horn  
Somewhere in the bleak mid-distance  
Something beautiful is born  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
I stumbled down a street of shadows  
A black hallelujah split the night  
Anarchists and priests were playing strip jack  
Underneath the crude lamplight  
I came upon a weeping soldier  
He said ""I'm all washed up now hush !""  
But when I glanced across his shoulder  
He held the royal flush  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
I'm still here, I'm still breathing  
I'm who I thought I was or just about  
I'll be walking down this boulevard  
Until my legs give out  
  
Thoughts like storms and seas are raging  
I know it is a matter of degree  
But it's not the world outside that's changing  
It's me  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be

Waterboys,Long Way To The Light,/w/waterboys/long+way+to+the+light_20145413.html,"I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill inn the distance  
Summer on the way  
Blue skies and sailing boats  
Like a picture in a book  
I can't believe I got here  
Or how long it took  
Living one step at a time  
Putting one foot in front of the other  
It sure feels right  
Healing on my mind  
Been a long way  
Been a long way to the light  
I'd made it to Manhattan  
Built myself a nest  
I meant to get right back to doing  
Exactly what I do best  
Pluggin' in an electric guitar  
Leading a band  
Well, if you want to give God a laugh  
Tell him your plans!  
Summer in the city  
Wilting in the heat  
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville  
And back to Hudson Street  
I learned meditation  
And how to visualize  
Just breathing, being still  
Never felt more alive!  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the fall in transit  
Circling the moon  
Like a cat on a hot tin roof  
Like a fiddle without a tune  
I found what I was searching for  
In Mrs Caddy's book  
I had to go there straightaway  
Have myself a look  
I flew back to Scotland  
Anticipation in my bones  
The old country welcoming me  
Like a prodigal coming home  
I knelt and kissed the tarmac  
In the wild Atlantic rain  
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood  
Rising in my veins  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the night in Glasgow  
Flew to Inverness  
I found the place and at the first  
I was not impressed  
Nobody said hello  
The faces left me cold  
Back then how was I to know  
All that would unfold?  
I entered the Sanctuary  
Heard the voice of a girl  
Sending out a circle of light  
Clear across the world  
I shuddered in the Power  
Like a seedling in a storm  
I've been traveling to this place  
Since the moment I was born  
Flew back to New York City  
Singing the big city blues  
The sand of Findhorn Bay  
Still clingin' to my shoes  
I tried to re-start my life  
But the life I knew was gone  
I had to let go everything  
But that's another song!  
Living one step at a time...  
So I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill in the distance  
Summer on the way  
I'm watching sailing boats  
Bobbing to and fro  
Time to hit the road  
The only way I know...  
Living one step at a time...

Far off in drowsy valleys  
Where the meadow saffrons blow  
The feet of summer dabble  
In their coiling calm and slow  
The banks are worn forever  
By a people sadly gay  
A Titan with loud laughter  
Made them of fire clay  
Go ask the springing flowers  
And the flowing air above  
What are the twin-born waters  
And they'll answer Death and Love  
  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
Two lonely spirits wait  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
'Fore paradise's gate.  
They may not pass the portal  
Poor earth-enkindled pair  
Though sad is many a spirit  
To pass and leave them there  
Still staring at their flowers  
That dull and faded are  
If one should rise beside thee  
The other is not far  
Go ask the youngest angel  
She will say with bated breath  
By the door of Mary's garden  
Are the spirits Love and Death

You'll never get there)  
But I will  
I will always climb the mountain  
Because I have heard the big music  
And I'll never be the same  
Something so pure  
Hey!  
Has called my name!

Do you see them riding through fields of snow?  
One rides for a woman who has no name  
One rides for a king  
And one just rides and rides and rides and rides  
For the girl in the swing  
  
They race like phantoms in the Belmont light  
You see them follow the Belmont light  
They ride through places where the walls are white  
Where the noble voices of women sing  
A brace of thanks and silent night  
And a song for the girl in the swing  
  
Well, you just asked me do I know what love is  
Well, sure I know, sure I know what love is  
It's the thief of sleep, a boy and his dog  
A red rubber ball, these old foolish things  
A rain that falls a long, long way from home  
It lives in the girl in the swing!  
It lives in the girl in the swing...

Waterboys,The Return Of Jimi Hendrix,/w/waterboys/the+return+of+jimi+hendrix_20145278.html,"I dreamed about Jimi Hendrix  
He came back for one day  
Was born weepin' out of an egg  
The mid-wife said  
And straight away began to pray  
With lifted head  
  
He spent the early hours  
Communing with the morning stars  
And then he came over to my house  
Where he tried out my guitar  
  
He was young and black and beautiful  
Big eyed, perfect skin an'  
He played my guitar like a lightning storm  
Like twirlin' feathers in the wind  
He could make it sound like the end of the world  
A fire, the flick of a knife  
He could squeeze it slow and masterful  
Like the hand that brought the world to life  
  
Together we strolled in sculptured gardens  
Passed the sleepy afternoon  
Maids were dartin' back and forth  
From a window came a violin tune  
Angels, dressed as nurses toyed with playin' cards  
Looters sprung from prisons filled the yard  
  
A yellow sun hung low and dawned,  
And as it dipped  
Jimi stood up straight, grinned  
And shook his velvet hips  
  
Callin' himself King Electric  
In the evening he went wild  
Played on a dozen stages  
In the clubs of New York -  
Lit the city end to end  
Wired it up, fired it up  
Scarved, bejewelled, long-legged, snake-limbed  
Athletic, driven, dangerous  
  
He made all Manhattan shake  
And every street and sidewalk quake  
His stratocaster caused the mighty Empire State  
To vibrate  
His whammy bar caused shock-eyed punks from  
Hackensack and Yonkers  
Raised on speed, metal and rap  
To enter trance and levitate  
  
He played Purple Haze and Pyramid,  
Voodoo Child and Sin-E,  
Up From the Skies and Storm Free  
In King Tut's Wah-Wah hut  
  
He did a forty-two minute  
Cosmic rise I

He moves amid the modern world in disguise  
It's possible to look into his immortal eyes  
He's like a man you'd meet anyplace  
Until you recognize that ancient face

On the very night that Christ was born

Waylon Jennings,Baker Street,/w/waylon+jennings/baker+street_20809127.html,"Winding your way down on Baker Street  
Lite in your head and dead on your feet  
Well, another crazy day you drink the night away  
And forget about everything.  
  
These city streets make you feel so cold  
It's got so many people but it's got no soul  
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything.  
  
Used to think that it was so easy  
Used to say that it was so easy  
You're tryin', you're tryin' now  
Another year and then you'd be happy  
One more year and then you'd be happy  
You're cryin', you're cryin' now.  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
You open the door he's got that look on his face  
And he asks you where you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about anything.  
  
He's got this dream about buyin' some land  
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands  
Then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town  
And forget about everything.  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
Know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone  
And when you wake up it's a new morning  
The sun is shining it's a new morning  
You're goin' you're goin' home

Like Scarlet O'Hara loved no one and wanted them all  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never forget you and love you inspite of your faults  
The good and the bad I want to remember it all  
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz  
The party's all over I came uninvited  
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball  
  
There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be  
I guess I should know that someone used to be me  
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same  
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names

We've been knocking around together so long  
Singing them same old songs  
Been out in the rain so long I swear we're shrinking

Goin' to El Paso  
Whoops  
Now this is what gave us the idea to come down here,  
This is a song about a guy that probably did as much for  
Our kind of music as anybody.  
  
Well the Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home  
The way you tip your hat to the ladies in the rose of San Antone  
  
I grew up on music that we call western swing  
It don't matter whose in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then  
In spite of all the hard times I'd live it all again  
To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing  
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the King  
  
You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee  
Its the home of country music on that we all agree  
But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss,  
That just don't mean a thing  
Once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
If you ain't never been there, then I guess you aint been told  
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got alot of soul  
Its the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing  
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the King.

Eighteen wheelers never go there  
Main Street's just too narrow for the load.  
  
A little town of honest people  
Some we haven't seen for quite awhile  
I was young and restless  
And we both were full of dreams and running wild.  
  
We left our old hometown and family  
Barely had a nickel to our name  
We were out to win the world  
Not once looking back or losing aim.  
  
We hit the big town and the big time  
Not a lot of effort in the deal  
But in the bargain we lost touch with one another  
And old feelings that were real.  
  
In a big house up on easy street  
Where too much never seems to be enough  
We're not the same two people far away  
From all the days when the times were rough.

Is separated by a wall

In fact we seldom even talk at all.

If I'd try just being clever  
Or pretend not to remember  
But it's funny how you've lingered  
On my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we share and care  
And lay our hearts on the line  
Maybe it wasn't meant to last  
Till the end of time  
Oh, but while it did  
Didn't we shine  
  
I still have some blue days  
That I could do without  
And when I have my blue days  
You're all I think about  
But I've long ago forgiven you  
For what you did or didn't do  
Now all I can recall  
Are the happy times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it my imagination  
Or didn't we shine

And my old dog Red's gone lame  
Please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in  
(Two ten six eighteen) ten forty four  
This old house is falling down there ain't no need in me for hanging round

The girl I left behind she's gone with this friend of mine  
I don't have to see a sign to know things ain't the same  
Please tell me if you can...  
You can't get far away on just a soldier's pay doesn't anybody know my name  
Used to be when I could see everybody wanted me  
Guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train

And feeling fool enough to see  
What I had called my brother on  
Now he had every right to call on me.

It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong  
We're in this gig together  
So let's settle down and steal each other's song.  
  
I found a wounded brother  
Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon  
And soon enough he turned on me  
Like he'd done every face in that saloon.  
  
Well, we cussed him to the ground  
And said he couldn't even steal a decent song  
But soon as it was spoken  
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong.

Unless you want that fiddle out of tune

But I think that I just stole somebody's song

In love with a good two timin' man.  
And she loves him in spite of the way  
That she don't understand.

Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

By forgotten words and boons  
And the ink stains  
That have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads

Keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted  
On their columns now that binds me  
Or something that somebody said  
Because they thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you  
Walking on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'  
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin  
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're waving from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory

Going either somewhere or nowhere  
Going without me, without you

Dying from grapes on the vine

Down where the mission bell cries  
And sorrow echoes through summer  
As he tries to close all his eyes  
  
You can find him in Pittsburgh in Christmas  
You can find him in Buffalo in June  
And he knows all the back roads between them  
Like the gypsy knows the moon

And four or five years slipped away

They had a good life, she was a good wife  
And bore him a young son named Jim

Bombs killed his lady and left him

Answers that he never found  
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound

His Green label each day  
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing

To watch my heroes rope and ride  
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry

Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away

Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on it should be easier now  
The lesson I've learned from you gold can't buy a heart can be broken and

Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I and it should be easier now  
  
The worst now is over I've stood the test it should be easier now  
They say everything happens for the best it should be easier now  
The wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide  
Hollowed and washed by the tears I've cried  
But now there'll be more room for love inside and it should be easier now

Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind

I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane

The chances your taking loving a free living man  
Are you really sure you really want what you see  
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be

So, far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change

Drinking and dancin' around late at night

I had built me an empire with my own two hands  
With the money and power to break any man

I gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't try  
She'd only laugh then walk out the door  
Each time she'd hurt me made me love her more

With their big long arms,  
And a peach in their pants.  
  
Picking fruit from the sky,

Goes passing them by.

From the heaven's above.

Look up to the skies and see

Little high, little low

Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead  
Mama, life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama, ooo  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  
  
Too late, my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama, ooo  
I don't want to die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a mam  
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the Fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning - very, very frightening me

The sleigh bells are ringing and the carolers are singing  
While the air raid sirens blare  
It's Christmas at ground zero

The radio just let us know that this is not a test  
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping  
It's the end of all humanity  
No more time for last minute shopping

While we dodge debris let's trim the tree  
Underneath the mushroom cloud  
  
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop  
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill  
But if someone's climbing down your chimney  
You better load your gun and shoot to kill  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
And if the radiation levels OK  
I'll go out with you and see all the new  
Mutations on New Year's Day  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
Just seconds left to go  
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover  
Underneath the mistletoe

These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I came up with more secrets to tell
you today  
These are my confessions  
Slip my mind the last two times  
Silly me, so now I gotta give you part three of my confessions  
First I told you about the skank that I was cheating with, then I mentioned
she's having my kid  
That's not all, now I recall more you see, so I'll give you part three of my
confessions  
  
Now this is gonna be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do,  
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two  
Like remember when I told you that I knew Paulie Shore (Paulie Shore)  
That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for  
I borrowed your chapstick (from you)without asking  
Oh and I tried out your nose hair trimmer (too)  
And by the way your diamond ring is cubic zirconium,  
I killed your goldfish accidently, just replaced it with another one  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I need to get some things off my
chest right away  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink  
There have been times when I've peed in your sink  
Don't know why, but you and I should agree that belongs in part three of my
confessions  
  
Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out why I used your toothbrush to
clean off the bathroom grout  
Oh and sometimes in private, really like to dress up as Shirley Temple and
spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)  
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, didn't get that raise.  
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days!  
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you're a midget  
I'm so sorry Debbie! I mean Bridget!  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I got a few more secrets I'd like
to convey  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Gave you buttered toast I dropped and picked up off the floor  
Fyi it was not a cold sore  
Ooops my bad, but you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my
confessions  
  
You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this, but you remember that
shirt you got me for my birthday?  
Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous, what were you
thinking?  
Oh and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week,  
I just didn't wanna go to your stupid office picnic  
Oh and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of rice krispies,  
What I meant was that there was only enough left for me. Sorry.  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say, I thought of some more things that
should scare you away  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Once I blew my nose and then I wiped it on your cat  
And I lied, yes that dress makes you look fat

People occasionally say ""yeah"" and other similar phrases,  
But it's generally just music.  
  
In the movie,  
It played in the background  
When Stanley rode out in the miniature fire engine  
At the beginning of an episode of Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse.  
  
The song is approximately  
1 minute and 45 seconds long,  
But it did not play in its entirety in the movie.

Then I went right back to bed

You know what I'm sayin'  
  
Well I ain't got not money  
I'm just walkin' down the road  
Said I ain't got no money, honey  
So I'm just walking down this lonely old road  
Well, I wish I could get me some money  
But I forgot my automated teller code  
  
I was born in a paper sack in the bottom of a sewer  
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast, my family was so poor  
My daddy was a waitress, my mama sold bathroom tiles  
My brothers and sisters all hated me 'cause I was an only child  
  
I got the blues so bad, woo  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead  
  
I'm just a no good, scum sucking, nose picking, boot licking,  
Sniveling, groveling, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Nothing but a low-down beer bellied, bone headed, pigeon toed,  
Turkey necked, weasel faced, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Guess I pretty low self image  
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something, I  
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time  
Make it talk  
Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk  
OK, now make it shut up  
  
Plagues and famine and pestilence always seem to get me down  
I always feel so miserable whenever I'm around  
I wish somebody would come along, stick a pitchfork through my brain  
I'd flush myself right down the toilet, but I'd just clog up the drain  
  
I got the blues so bad  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll go bowling  
Or I just might go bowling  
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling  
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid looking  
Shirt and go bowling instead

And he'd say ""Howdy"" when you walked in the door  
  
Always treated me nice, gave me kindly advice

She was fun to talk to and nice to smell  
So I took her to the homecoming dance  
  
Then I tied her to a chair and I shaved off all her hair  
And I left her in the desert all alone

I can still hear the screams  
Oh I wonder if she ever made it home

I don't care about what's hip  
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do  
I won't swim in your jacuzzi  
You can't make me settle down  
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch  
And scream until I'm blue  
I may as well be hyper as long as I'm still around  
'Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back  
When I'm six feet underground

I don't really like to jog  
No Joni Mitchell 8-tracks in my car, ooh  
I hate anything organic  
Even health food makes me sick  
You won't catch me sipping Perrier  
Down in some sushi bar, I tell you  
Now's the time to go for all the gusto you can grab  
You'll have plenty of time to be low-key

I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans  
No redwood hot tub to my name  
I got all that I want and if it's all the same to you  
I don't need a course in self-awareness  
To find out who I am  
And I'd rather have a, a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack  
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan  
So don't ask me what I'm into  
I don't need to prove I'm cool  
I'll break your arm if you ask me what's my sign  
I won't tell you where my head's at  
I don't need to see no shrink  
Psychosis may be in this year  
But I'm really not that kind  
And I'm in no hurry to be casual  
In fact, I think, I'll wait  
Until I'm pushing up the daisies  
Like wow, man, can you relate?

Your hair's a mess and your make-up's crusty

Who make a habit of biting their toenails  
Wo, every time you call, you drive me up the wall  
Honey, just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl  
  
I'm sure we'd be happy together  
If only one little thing weren't true  
Oh baby, I yi yi yi yi

You're belchin' everywhere, foulin' up the air

You don't have an ounce of class  
You're just one big pain in the neck

It's hard for me to keep my lunch down  
  
And when you ask me what I'm thinkin', honey, usually I'm thinkin'  
How I'd really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape  
So I wouldn't have to listen to you asking me those stupid questions  
Over and over again

Weird Al Yankovic,Isle Thing,/w/weird+al+yankovic/isle+thing_20145796.html,"Met this fine young thing  
At the local Circle K  
We made a date for a half past eight  
And I said, ""What the hey?""  
  
So I journeyed to her crib  
And I let myself inside  
That chick was slouched down on the couch  
I think her brain was fried  
  
Couldn't figure it out  
She wouldn't even look at me  
Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized  
Cold glued to her TV  
  
""Hey, what's your problem baby doll  
Let's have a little fling""  
She said, ""Hey you fool, now just be cool  
I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing""  
  
Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
  
Watchin' all night  
Musta, been a marathon  
I was bummin', those shows kept comin'  
Here's what was goin' on  
  
These castaways were stranded  
On this island out at sea  
One of them called Gilligan  
So let's name him after m  
  
He'd mess up every rescue  
Man, that first mate was illin'  
If I was one of those castaways  
I think I'd probably kill 'I'm  
  
Just about that time  
Telephone began to ring  
She said, ""Just let it, my machine'll get  
We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
I like the professor  
He always saves their butts  
He could build a nuclear reactor  
From a couple of coconuts  
  
She said, ""That guy's a genius""  
I shook my head and laughed  
I said, ""If he's so fly, they tell me why  
He couldn't build a lousy raft""  
  
And while we're on the subject  
I'll tell you one thing for sure  
Those homeboys brought an awful lot  
For just a three hour tour  
  
Then her mom came in the room  
It was kind of embarrassing  
She said, ""Hey you two, I was once like you  
And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing""  
  
Isle thing  
She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
Skipper's in a hammock  
He's looking kinda fat  
He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit  
Old Gilligan with his hat  
  
Mrs. Hal had it goin' on  
But Mr. Hal was meaner  
Ginger and Mary Anne could've used  
Some funky cold medina (?)  
  
I was really diggin' this show  
I didn't know what to do  
It kinda looked like I was hooked  
Now I'm an addict too  
  
I know each episode by heart  
Now I'm the rerun king  
And on every date we both stay up late  
And we watch the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Hasta la vista, little buddy  
Gilligan's Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing

And I had my weapon drawn  
  
So I get my handcuffs  
My cyanide pills  
My classified dossier

Dial a random number up on your telephone  
You ask if their refrigerator is running  
Then you tell 'em they should go out and catch it  
Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from  
They'd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet  
Listen to me

Askin' for Prince Albert in a can  
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call  
To some guy he doesn't know who lives in Japan  
He's callin' strangers up at three in the morning  
Gives 'em pizza pie delivery at four  
He won't be laughin when they're tracin' his line  
One day the phone police will be there at his door  
Yo, hear me  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall  
How long is this phase gonna last?

And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi  
  
Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho  
  
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past  
But most of'em were nudniks and none of'em would last  
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick  
I tell ya, he's to die for - he really knows his shtick  
  
So how's by you? Have you seen this Jew?  
Reads the Torah, does his own accounting too  
Working' like a dog at the synagogue  
He's there all day, he's there all day  
  
Just say ""Vay is mir!"" and he'll kick into gear  
He'll bring you lots of cheer and maybe bagels with some shmeer  
Just grab your yarmulka and

He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel  
But if you want to haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!  
  
People used to scoff, now they say ""Mazel tov!""  
He's such a macher 'cause he works his tuchis off  
Yeah, he keeps his cool and teaches shul  
What's not to like? What's not to like?  
  
Oh high holy days, you know he prays and prays  
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise  
Put on your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss  
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss  
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hhhhhip  
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to keep the tip!

Weird Al Yankovic,The Night Santa Went Crazy,/w/weird+al+yankovic/the+night+santa+went+crazy_20145692.html,"Down in the workshop all the elves were making toys  
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys  
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death  
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath  
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo  
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo  
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,  
""Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!""  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' the raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
  
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it  
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet  
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage  
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage  
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger  
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddie Krueger  
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen  
And he took a big bite and said, ""It tastes just like chicken!""  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night Kris Kringle went nuts  
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole  
Without stepping in reindeer guts  
  
There's the National Guard and the F. B. I.  
There's a van from the Eyewitness News  
And helicopters circling around in the sky  
And the bullets are flying, the body count's rising  
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?  
My my my my my my  
You used to be such a jolly guy  
  
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time  
In a federal prison for his infamous crime  
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears  
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years  
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous  
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service  
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night  
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights  
  
They're talkin' 'bout  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nicholas flipped  
Broke his back for some milk and cookies  
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped  
  
Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped, in his brain

Weird Al Yankovic,The Plumbing Song,/w/weird+al+yankovic/the+plumbing+song_20145754.html,"""Who fixes plumbing problems in a flash? Twenty four hours a day? Seven days a
week?""  
  
Baby, I sure wish I could lend you a hand  
But plumbing's one thing I don't understand  
It's true (Haven't got a clue)  
be be be baby, I can tell you've got a big problem  
When I flush the john, then your shower goes on  
(Baby) Now watcha gonna do?  
If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke  
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench  
(Baby) He'll be there for you  
  
Shower's backing up (up, up)?  
Water won't go down (down, down)?  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Don't forget my plumber  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Sink's been stopped up all summer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call the plumber  
He'll know what to do  
  
Pipes been blowing up  
Pipes been breaking down  
And the carpet's soaked... right through  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, kitchen's flooded, too  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, girl, you know it's true  
  
be be be betcha this guy makes more than my lawyer  
If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay  
(Baby) He can be here by 2:00  
So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash  
Makin' service calls in his overalls  
(Baby) He'll do his best for you  
  
Sewer's backing up (up, up)?  
Got you feelin' down (down, down)?  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Don't forget my plumber  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Leaky pipes are a bummer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Time to call the plumber  
Maybe call a few  
  
Got a problem with plumbing?  
Gotta blame it on something  
Blame it on the drain it was cloggin', cloggin'  
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night  
If hairballs, grease and goo  
Won't let the water through  
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah  
  
When I flush the john, now when I flush the john  
It turns your shower on  
(Roto-Rooter 6-5000)  
Ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call my plumber  
He'll know what to do  
  
(Call now. We're in the yellow pages!)

Weird Al Yankovic,The Saga Begins,/w/weird+al+yankovic/the+saga+begins_20145777.html,"A long long time ago  
In a galaxy far away  
Naboo was under an attack  
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn  
Could talk the Federation into  
Maybe cutting them a little slack  
But their response, it didn't thrill us  
They locked the doors and tried to kill us  
We escaped from that gas  
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass  
We took a bongo from the scene  
And we went to Theed to see the queen  
We all wound up on Tatooine  
That's where we found this boy  
  
Oh my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""  
  
Did you know this junkyard slave  
Isn't even old enough to shave  
But he can use the Force they say  
Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen  
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen  
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday  
Well, I know he built C3PO  
And I've heard how fast his pod can go  
And we were broke, it's true  
So we made a wager or two  
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace  
And the minute Jabba started off that race  
Well, I know who would win first place  
Oh yes, it was our boy  
  
We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""  
""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""  
  
Now we finally got to Coruscant  
The Jedi Council we knew would want  
To see how good the boy could be  
So we took him there and we told the tale  
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale  
And he might fulfill that prophecy  
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course  
Could he bring balance to the force?  
They interviewed the kid  
Oh, training they forbid  
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear  
And Qui-Gon said, ""Now listen here  
Just stick it in your pointy ear  
I still will teach this boy""  
  
He was singin' my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""  
  
We caught a ride back to Naboo  
Cause Queen Amidala wanted to  
I frankly would've liked to stay  
We all fought in that epic war  
And it wasn't long at all before  
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day  
And in the end some Gungans died  
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried  
A lot of folks were croakin'  
The battle droids were broken  
And the Jedi I admire most  
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast  
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost  
I guess I'll train this boy  
  
And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""  
We were singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye

Guess the champ got too lazy  
Ain't gonna fly now he's just takin' up space  
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain  
  
But he's no bum, he works down the street  
He bought the neighborhood deli  
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat  
Come inside maybe you'll hear him say  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser they're our special tonight  
If you want you can have an appetizer  
You might like our salami and the liver's all right  
And they'd really go well with the rye or the kaiser  
  
Never eats while on the job  
He heard it's good to stay hungry  
But he makes a pretty mean shishkabob  
Have a taste they were made fresh today  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white  
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer  
Stay away from the tuna it smells funny tonight  
But you just can't go wrong with the rye or the kaiser  
  
So today, his deli comes first  
Still he dreams of his past days of glory  
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst  
All the while you can still hear him say  
  
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite  
Let me please be your catering advisor  
If you want substitutions I won't put up a fight  
You can have your roast beef on the rye or the kaiser

They're lurking patiently  
And hoping that they just might  
See something real embarrassing

When you're walking down the street  
And asking stupid questions  
While you're trying to eat  
So you cover your face

A quickie divorce

Sneaking in  
Snapping pictures, of course

Picking your nose  
Or storming down the street  
On a drunken spree

Stalking you  
Just waiting by a front door  
Trailing you through  
Airport security

Where a famous person can't  
Even get a D.U.I  
Or go on a racist rant

So you really shouldn't dare  
Go to every club in town

A star decides to shave their head  
Or ram their car into a tree

Come on and grab your ammo  
What have you got to lose?  
We'll all get liquored up  
And shoot at anything that moves  
  
Got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a laser sight  
Oh, I'm prayin' somebody tries to break in here tonight  
I always keep a Magnum in my trunk  
You better ask yourself, do you feel lucky, punk?

Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Pedal to the metal, hope I don't run out of luck  
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
My diesel rig is northward bound  
It's time to put that hammer down  
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by  
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel  
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel  
While I'm still waiting for my nails to dry  
  
Oh, I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror  
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight  
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight  
Well, I sure hope my seams are straight  
Lord, don't let my mascara run tonight  
  
Because I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck  
Got these eighteen wheels a-rollin until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
Oh, I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me  
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much  
But when I hit those big speed bumps  
My darling little rhinestone pumps  
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch  
  
But still I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Headin' down the interstate, just tryin' to make buck  
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon  
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a truck  
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck  
And I'm late for my appointment down at the hair salon  
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on

Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time

Baby someday, you'll look back and see  
That it's right here, that you should've been  
But you can run back to me  
  
And don't make me look for someone new  
When all I wanted is you  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I

I know I should be stronger but I lose all control  
Fighting with myself tryna hide what you don't know

The waiting here forever with this shattered heart  
Lying to myself tryna act like I don't care, no

And all the walls I've been building up  
Just crack and then break when you're around

And nothing I do to fight it matters now
