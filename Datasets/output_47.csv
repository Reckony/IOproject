Nine Inch Nails,The Warning,/n/nine+inch+nails/the+warning_20407823.html,"Some say it was a warning  
Some say it was a sign  
I was standing right there  
When it came down from the sky  
The way it spoke to us  
You felt it from inside  
Said it was up to us  
Up to us to decide  
  
You've become a virus  
That has eaten up its host  
We've been watching you with all of our eyes  
And what you seem to value most  
  
So much potential  
Or so we used to say  
Your greed, self importance, and your arrogance  
You piss it all away  
  
We heard a cry  
We've come to intervene  
You will change your ways, and you will make amends  
Or we will wipe this place clean  
  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away

Some other way

And now you're one of us  
The wretched  
  
The hopes and prays  
The better days  
The far aways

This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
The clouds will part and the sky cracks open  
And god himself will reach his fucking arm through  
Just to push you down  
Just to hold you down  
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss  
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this  
Back at the beginning  
Sinking  
Spinning  
  
And in the end  
We still pretend  
The time we spend  
Not knowing when  
You're finally free  
And you could be  
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it

How I used to like a good fuck every once in awhile  
I just wanted you to know

A place to bury everything I did  
And lie onto the ground  
If I illuminate I finally see  
The masterpiece itself

I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
Like it did back then, it'll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
  
Remember all the songs that we used to know  
Dancin' in the dark to the radio  
Lost in the rythmn, kickin' up some heat  
The memories are still so sweet  
  
Time's gone by but it's plain to see  
I still love you and you still love me  
Let's shake these troubles put 'em all aside  
see'mon we're gonna take that ride  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright

Passing time with a runaway moon  
Talkin' to myself  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
It's been too long since I held you girl  
Twice a thousand miles  
But my heart won't beat alone  
I need the love I left behind  
  
Hold back the dawn awhile  
This will all work out  
Don't let this dream die  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
And I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again  
  
Now the night is dark with diamonds  
And I'm standing inside the rain  
Giving up your love  
Was the worst mistake I made  
There's a sound I hear in the distance  
Seems it's calling out my name  
Well I'll pay most any price  
I just hope I'm not too late  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Oh, it's true  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Fish Song,/n/nitty+gritty+dirt+band/fish+song_20101233.html,"Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust  
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost  
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed  
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read  
  
[Chorus:]  
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room  
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon

I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows

Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows.

Just movin' slow...  
  
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's come  
And the days are gettin' long  
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along

Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night

Dream up ways to live with out her  
We made vows that I can not excuse  
Yes forever don't last the way it used too  
  
We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with  
The law says you might confess to  
Enough coals, hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose  
That forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Hammers, razors fill the trash  
You throw'em out when you use the last  
Get a new form son, don't become confused  
If forever don't last the way it used to

Used to walk, singing songs by the river  
Even when she knew for sure  
She'd have to go away

For one single day

She came from the land of the cotton  
A land that was nearly forgotten

She worked and she slaved so hard

Her silent heart touched, she helped me to know it:  
She is the universe I am the poet

I can hardly remember what then used to be  
  
Then  
There was someone I knew  
Looked exactly like me  
  
I was running and running  
With so much to boast  
  
And I had no idea  
What matters the most  
  
Now  
As the air in the night  
Becomes cooler and sweet

Later  
When all of this has turned to songs  
And faded pics  
  
Later  
When colored wooden blocks  
Turn into heavy bricks  
  
Later  
When you will greet me only  
With the shyest smile  
  
Who knows what later brings?  
And so meanwhile..  
  
Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.

You are sadly mistaken  
The time has come for evolution  
Fuck collusion, kill the five  
  
Whatever happens to the handshake  
Whatever happens to deals no-one would break  
What happens to integrity  
It's still there it always was  
For playing music just because  
A million reasons why  
(All) dinosaurs will die

Beautiful soldiers in their beds  
Making love inside their hands

Tonight could be their end  
  
With the weapons in their hands  
And their eyes closed as they stand  
Can they end it all tonight so easily?

Will they want to find a way  
To make it all right

What if lightning strikes them twice?  
Will they give up on their lives  
And finally divide?

Locked up in a box behind her closet door  
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder

When you just say goodbye  
I'll lay awake one more night  
Caught in a vision I want to deny  
  
And did I mention the note that I found  
Taped to my locked front door  
It talked about no regrets  
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor  
  
I rode the train for hours on end  
And watched the people pass me by  
It could be that it has no end  
Just an action junkie's lullaby  
  
New York City  
We were full of the stuff that every dream rested  
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky  
Caught up in the whole illusion  
That dreams never pass us by  
Came to a tattooed conclusion  
That the big one was knocking on the door  
What started as a mass delusion  
Would take me far from the place I adore

So i had to plan my escape, out the skins,  
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,  
Untill i call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,  
I wish moms would hurry up, so i can get buck wild,  
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,  
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst,  
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,  
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,  
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,  
Im seein' my death, and i ain't even took my first step,  
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,  
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars

before i had nickels and  
Dimes, i knew that i was goin' somewhere,

Would pac be alive, if u let pac drive,  
Swear to god to reverse it i give my left eye,  
With the right i visualized, the king of bed-stuy,  
Checkin his daughter tianna into junior high,  
If i was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive,in 2006 it might sound like
this,  
N.Y. 718 212, with sues rendevouz,  
Its like moulin rouge,  
High fashion, up town air force ones,  
And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses  
Lace dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes,  
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan,  
With that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit,  
Would u get u capped, and wrapped in plastic,  
Tell the captain, S Roge was happennin',  
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the magnum

On the drug scene, fuck the football team,  
Risk it, rupt ur spleens, by the age of 16,  
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,  
I mean, i wanna blow up, stack my doe up,  
So school i didn't show up, and fucked my flow up,  
Mom said that i should grow up, and check myself,  
Before i wreck myself, disrespect myself,  
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! i couldn't see it,  
Scarface king of New York, i wanna be it,  
Rap was secondary, money was neccessary,  
Untill i got encarcerated, kinda scary,  
See 74' march 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,  
Time to contemplate, damn were did i fail,  
All the money i stacked, was all the money for bail,

Notorious B.I.G.,Juicy,/n/notorious+big/juicy_20101878.html,"Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me  
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the  
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on  
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter  
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?  
  
It's all good baby baby  
  
It was all a dream  
I used to read Word Up magazine  
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine  
Hangin pictures on my wall  
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl  
I let my tape rock til my tape popped  
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock  
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack  
With the hat to match  
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha  
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far  
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight  
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade  
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner  
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner  
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri  
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)  
I'm blowin up like you thought I would  
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)  
It's all good (it's aaalll good)  
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
You know very well who you are  
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars  
You had a few, but not that many  
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty  
  
I made the change from a common thief  
To up close and personal with Robin Leach  
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day  
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way  
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy  
Girls used to diss me  
Now they write letters cause they miss me  
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff  
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff  
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast  
From the Mississippi down to the east coast  
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks  
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak  
Livin life without fear  
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears  
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool  
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school  
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood  
And it's still all good  
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis  
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this  
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa  
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur  
Phone bill about two G's flat  
No need to worry, my accountant handles that  
And my whole crew is lounging  
Celebrating every day, no more public housing  
Thinking back on my one-room shack  
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back  
And she loves to show me off, of course  
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source  
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us  
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us  
Birthdays was the worst days  
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay  
Uh, damn right I like the life I live  
Cause I went from negative to positive  
And it's all

Strictly gun testing, coke measuring  
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito  
Hitting fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's  
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease  
Muah!, may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours  
Four-four, and fifty-four draw  
As my pilot, steers my Leer  
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear  
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying  
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying  
So don't you get suspicious  
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious  
As I leave my competition, respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style  
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all  
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)  
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)  
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)

Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows  
My back don't bend, see papi is my kinfolk  
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke  
Soul benefactor the Benz, he made the rims poke  
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie  
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy  
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses  
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing  
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow  
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa  
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing  
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)  
On the flip side, the steel I'm gripping  
You thought all the floss had me slipping?  
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing  
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad  
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar  
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car  
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage  
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop  
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue  
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof  
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof  
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable  
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table  
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle  
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able  
This here hughe the most foolish of blues  
When I tell my mom the price  
She damn near sent me to my room  
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S  
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh

To orgies with hoes I never seen before

Oh I want her back in ma ride, back in ma ride  
I want no girlfriend  
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool,  
We can do this if you feelin' the same I do  
Come on girl, let's go to ma hotel  
Have a party all night in ma hotel  
Pop bubble smoke dope in ma hotel  
In 20 minutes girl  
Hit me on ma self

I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck  
wild juvenile rippin' mics and shit  
New York New York ready for the likes of this uh  
Then came the worst date May 21st  
2:19, that's when my momma water burst  
No spouse in the house so she rode for self  
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help  
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck  
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step  
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy  
The doctor looked and said, ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy""  
  
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream  
On the drug scene, fuck a football team  
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen  
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean  
I want to blow up, stack my dough up  
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up  
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself  
before I wreck myself, disrespect myself  
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it  
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it  
Rap was secondary, money was necessary  
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary  
C74-Mark 8 set me straight  
Not able to move behind the great steel gate  
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?  
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail  
  
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons  
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'  
Honey's is tantalizin', they freak all night  
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night  
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed  
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game  
And to my niggas livin' street life  
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest  
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'  
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'

Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight  
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try  
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die  
  
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw up  
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up  
Choppin' rocks overnight  
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' ta turn into the black Frank White  
We had to grow dreads to change our description  
Two cops on the milk box missin'  
Show they toes you know they got stepped on  
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon  
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat  
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack  
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me  
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze  
Celebrate, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight  
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And still I'm havin' memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed  
As I laugh pushin' the gas when my glocks blast  
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart  
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts  
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes  
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches  
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me  
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me  
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do  
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'  
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me  
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state  
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate  
Ma main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped  
He screamed, ""Thug Life"" and emptied a clip

Stop the dogs from barkin  
Then proceed to walkin

And taped up his wife

Wet em up no less  
Than 50 shots in his direction  
How many shots?

What kinda gats?  
Hitch links, Cocks, and Calicoles

Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that  
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now  
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted  
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways  
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day  
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway  
My forte causes Caucasians to say  
He sounds demented, car weed scented  
If I said it, I meant it  
Bite my tongue for no-one  
Call me evil, or unbelievable  
  
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes  
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?  
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear  
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me  
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream  
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut  
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill  
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer  
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver  
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi  
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC  
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

I will fear no evil -- for you are with me  
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me  
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies  
You annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows  
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
  
Niggaz in my faction don't like askin questions  
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin  
Givin pleasure in the Benz-ito  
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's  
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease  
MWA, may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours  
Four-four, and fifty-four draw  
as my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear  
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear  
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin  
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin  
So don't you get suspicious  
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious  
As I leave my competition, respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success escalator style  
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death  
controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh  
I spit phrases that'll thrill you  
You're nobody til somebody kills you  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you

Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino  
Ask Nino, he know  
Green with envy, the green tempts me  
to make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese  
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty  
live happily, ever after in laughter  
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster  
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead  
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do  
but tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed  
Incidents like this I take trips  
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)  
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour  
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore  
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin  
buy me lavender and fuschia Gators  
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters  
Rich bitch shit, drinkin Cristal  
til they piss the shit, uhh  
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches  
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me  
Reminesce on dead friends too

Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit  
You ain't worth spit, just a memory  
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range (I remember that)  
Silly cat, all suede in the rain  
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame  
before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane  
I can't recall his name (what was his name?) you mean that kid  
that nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?  
Gettin his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine  
A fuckin shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?

There was a girlie in the corner with a plastic face  
And then she disappeared without a trace  
I say without a trace  
Well now we're kicking back and we're sipping beers  
And there's a man telling stories about his inner fears  
We was all choked up and too close to tears  
Well then we moved on up to some margaritas  
And we started making faces at the senoritas  
Playing drinking games, but they were all too drunk to beat us  
Well now, my car broke down about an hour ago  
We were heading on down to New Mexico,  
But, well we did not see the gas was low

About halfway home

A grounded love,  
And some memories  
Why do I hurt the ones  
Who get close to me?  
Darling, are you listening?  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
Forget about the things we've done,  
And bring it back to one

We're all a little different,

Don't you let it scare you  
Don't you lose your touch  
And when your still waters start to run,  
Bring it back to one  
  
One more night,

I put the pieces down with the blame.

Washed me away.

Take me home.  
  
Oh No, said I'm out that door again,  
I left my house, my money,  
And my dearest friend.  
I'm not going back jack.  
I cross the river got a little  
Bit of business that I'm doing today.  
You didn't feel me,  
You can't really see no good,  
I made my life out a stack of wood.  
I've been moving cross the river today,  
But Who's Chariot?  
Take me home! Take me home.  
  
Whose chariot? Take me home.  
Hallaluyah! Coming home.  
Chariot, gotta, where will you take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Oh Chariot would ya pick me up, take me.

I asked myself why  
Can I never let anyone in ?

Come get me off the merry-go-round

Come feed me and then bring-a-me down

'Cause I was in a trance and I forgot it all  
Banging on about all that  
Revolution in her head

Well heaven must have sent ya  
To save me from the rapture

All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red  
It's blocking the sun light that shines overhead  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls,  
Voices inside you churn, watch the city burn  
  
Your own liberation will leave them behind  
All the slings and arrows that rain on your mind,  
Don't make it better break it 'cause  
It never mattered anyway

I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago  
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times  
I carry on and never once have even questioned why  
  
I'm innocent  
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders  
I'm innocent  
But the battles started are far from over  
  
We 're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night  
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down  
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own  
We carry on without even realizing why  
  
We're innocent  
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders  
We're innocent  
But the battles left us are far from over  
  
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies  
And ruined our streams  
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs  
That threaten our lives  
  
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands  
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night  
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed  
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see  
  
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today  
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why

Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way  
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing  
It brings me down, but I won't let them  
  
If I seem bleak  
Well you'd be correct  
And if I don't speak  
It's cause I can't disconnect  
But I won't be burned by the reflection  
Of the fire in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun  
  
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway  
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away  
There's more to living than only surviving  
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying  
  
Though you hear me  
I don't think that you relate  
My will is something  
That you can't confiscate  
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated  
By destruction in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun

Some will feel like you can't find your way

Heaven knows I've seen it all before  
Now don't get me wrong  
I've seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good we'll take you by the hand  
'Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no one's aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know it's like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision?  
Could you think for yourself and go on?  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So you'd best go along  
Don't let on if you can't find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire  
Your life's a throw

You've become  
And suddenly you're standing  
On your own  
Far from Home  
Far from Home  
And when we're face to face  
Look in my eyes  
And when we're face to face  
Tell me no lies  
You know we need help  
And I'm with you  
All of the way  
All of the way

Only love can take a man  
And turn him inside out  
Time to turn the page and start  
A whole new story now  
Once again we're standing

When mother earth was young and dinosaurs walked to and fro  
His skull contained but half a brain but he didn't mind at all  
He's a hot shot caveman, yah do dah [?]  
Who loved to fight and brawl  
  
He walked the misty plate in time to find whatever he could find  
Then at last he saw her there, covered with hair  
A cavegirl looking right his way, half naked, half well who can say  
Such a thing he'd never seen before, Well then need I tell you more  
The caveman fell in love, love, love  
And so he wielded his club  
  
Oooh oooh what could he do?  
You can't blame a fellow for trying his luck,  
He's just a simple caveman who wanted to---  
Well when the cavegirl came around she had some things to relate  
About the methods he used to communicate  
And she said--  
  
(Female spoken)  
I never expected a caveman to exhibit much finesse,  
But a fifty pound club ain't exactly a caress  
So if you want to call me, you better learn to talk  
Until you learn some manners buddy,  
Take a walk!

Soldiers with a dream.

With kakis and fatigues  
They're tough as nails and armed to the teeth  
With automatic M-16s  
  
Iconoclastic girls that know the plan  
To finnish the job like no one else can  
To fight so the city's safe for you and me

Looking for acts of violence  
Sweet little poison pussycats

They waste no time on busts  
They stand their ground and open fire  
Unload their might of justice

Shivering in the moonlight.  
Smell the gunpowder and sweet hot breath  
We're gonna have fun tonight!

A stiff salute to their courage and their passion!

A leader, a prophet -

Blank.  
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.  
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!

For an innocent dance.  
He left with his brain smeared  
All over his pants! cause he  
Didn't belong here, he  
Didn't belong here  
He never should've left  
That warm cage in a zoo!  
His face was so ugly  
What else could I do?  
Can you - really blame me, I  
Had to smash it.  
He left me no choice,  
He was just like the others.  
I just had to kill him.  
With my poor, dear, old  
Mother.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly fucked in the ass  
By a legion of forty ex-cons

Don't belong here

It's a hallucination  
It's a mystic vibration  
It's just intimidation  
It's the will of the people  
It's the church with the steeple  
It's the sacred devotion

If your friends and your neighbors push  
Why don't you push them back  
Don't you think the time has come  
To stand up and be heard  
Ain't no use to try and wait  
For the magic word  
It's a new generation  
It's an infatuation  
It's a beautiful body  
Both erotic and deadly  
It's the fear of the future  
It's just surgeons and sutures  
It's a spandex obsession  
It's a lasting impression  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
Baptized in electronic water  
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters  
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks  
And the righteous bath  
Death to the freaks  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
From the man whose voice sounds reassuring  
Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before  
And seen the world from shore to shore  
With the calmness and tranquility that oozes credibility  
With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense  
And it makes you feel just like a babe  
Daddy holding you tight and safe  
Hush babe everything's all right, Daddy's gonna stay with you tonight  
Now he's got you by the balls, he can sell you anything at all  
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines  
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy  
It's a new generation  
It's a divine inspiration  
Always ready to follow  
Ever willing to swallow  
All the doctor's prescriptions  
All the mystic inscriptions

It's the calm meditation  
Of a tranquilized nation

Everyone said, ""If you don't get straight  
You'll surely go to hell.""  
  
But Johnny didn't care,  
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,  
He didn't want to do what he was told  
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.  
  
His teachers didn't understand,  
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,  
Just because he didn't want to learn things  
He had other interests  
He liked to burn things!  
  
The lady down the block,  
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,  
So he took it the first chance he had.  
Then he shot her in the leg,  
And this is what she said  
""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""  
""Only a lad. Society made him.""  
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""  
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh  
""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""  
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""  
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
  
His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,  
Nobody could help.  
The little man had no gratitude.  
  
And when he stole the car,  
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.  
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,  
Who had to go and die.  
It made the judge cry.

It's not his fault that he can't behave,

Perhaps he'll go away,  
He'll go away

So you wanted to play  
Yes, you wanted to play

Melt,  
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt  
And I said yes  
And I said yes

With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand

With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips

Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream

My little place is three steps away  
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise  
He said ""Come on little baby, won't you please be nice""  
So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib  
Said, ""here it is baby, this is where I live""  
Won't you take a load off, can I fix you a drink  
Baby turned real slowly and said, ""Piggy you stink""  
Piggy said baby, do you have a smoke?  
Baby said no, she was tryin to quit  
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats  
When his jaw dropped open and he said... ""shit""  
Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times  
And though piggy was stupid,  
Baby sure didn't mind  
Baby said, ""lets go straight to the stars""  
And Piggy said  
""huh? .... whatever""  
Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park  
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix  
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks  
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their finger-tips  
So they figured it was best to clear out for a while  
Piggy had lots of friends, or so he would boast  
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control  
So they packed up his Lincoln, and head for the coast  
Baby started smokin again on the way  
Piggy's little habit was making him sweat  
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days  
To scam some cash up and make a few bets  
They went and shacked up in a place on the strip  
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick  
Baby turned to Piggy with a desperate plea  
""c'mon Piggy, you know what we need""  
But the problem, you see, was that they were broke as shit  
So Piggy asked Baby if she'd turn a few tricks  
She argued at first, but she finally agreed  
With a couple of shiners, she hit the street  
Now Piggy felt good, and piggy felt mean  
And Piggy was high on his self esteem  
So he pulled out his piece, in front of a cop  
But the cop said ""Fuck you"" and Piggy got popped

And I can't even get to paradise  
And a priest came up to me and touched my face  
He said terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
No demon, no man has got a clue  
But surely son, the end will turn out right for you  
'Cause I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
  
There's a little boy walking up the stairs  
Through a dark hallway that leads nowhere  
He comes to a door but he's afraid to knock  
And he bends down low and peers throught the lock  
And there's a tall man standing with a glistening knife  
And he's stooping over something that has no life  
With stifled tears he starts to turn away  
But a strange little voice seems to whisper  
""Stay!""  
He's always been a sucker for mystery  
And he's always been...  
  
(Chorus)  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
  
Won't somebody help  
Won't somebody help  
I'm all alone now with nothing to do  
And I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go  
And I'm stuck with two tickets to an awful show  
And my mouth's full of words but I've got nothing to say  
And I've been sitting in front of the TV set all day  
And my head's in a vice and it won't let up  
And my feet won't move and if that ain't enough  
The telephone rings... ""Hello!""  
  
I've seen children with such angry faces  
When you look in their eyes, it makes you want to cry  
There's a time and a place for everything  
There's a time and a place for everything  
  
Now it doesn't seem fair  
But who cares they're someone else's  
As long as they don't come close to mine  
There's a time and a place for everything  
There's a time and a place for everything  
  
So we packed our bags and went back to the hotel  
In back of the squalor and the living hell  
And they sell you this and they sell you that  
They sell you their sister for a buck and a half  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
And people disappear without a trace  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been...  
  
Well the mystery that intrigues me the most  
Is the one that makes men give up hope  
The pride and the search for even little things  
That might give a meaning, or even a hint  
Cause how can a free man not have hope  
When he hasn't even reached the end of his rope  
  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I don't want to close the gate  
I still think that it's not too late  
I know when I reach the end  
I want to start all over again  
  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery...

On a highway bad jet fighters come from all directions  
Shooting verbal missiles, find their target right on sight, right on sight

Staring at a paper he is lost inside his head  
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition  
All around, the bodies of the wounded and the dead, and the dead

Never see the sun go down  
  
Sometimes the challenge presses hard upon my brow  
And I know the time is now  
But my wits are stiff and swollen  
I pay my dues and limp a rough and rocky climb  
As I try to buy some time  
Before the dark has fallen  
  
I am but a man  
Can I stop encroaching shadows?  
Would that I could keep the black away  
I have a scheme to save the day  
  
I will find a golden eagle  
Resting somewhere on the ground  
And ride him ever westward  
Never see the sun go down  
And I'll ride him for circles

Oliver,Half Life,/o/oliver/half+life_20944201.html,"I'm awake in the afternoon, I fell asleep in the living room  
It's one of those moments when everything is so clear  
before the truth goes back into hidding  
I wanna decide cause it's worth deciding  
to work on finding something more than fear  
It takes so much out of me to pretend  
tell me now tell me how  
Make amens  
  
Maybe, I need to see the daylight  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately.... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
is there really no escape, no escape from time  
of any kind  
  
I keep trying to understand  
this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out  
I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that away  
It's fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing  
It takes too much out of me to pretend  
  
Maybe I need to see the day light  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
Is there really no escape, no escape from time  
or any kind  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
well c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets.... Fall in love.... Again  
  
Cause lately, something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
without you I get breaking down  
O, wake me  
I wanna see the day light  
save me from this half life  
let you and I escape

And she laughs and she cries  
And her life seems to be  
Such a worried and jumbled affair

I've searched her eyes  
And if you ask of Mary  
I'll tell you why

Through the mad, through the sane,  
Through the joy and the pain  
'Til she finds her place in the sun

And each song they know  
Can help them to grow

She's ever known before  
And want her as we may  
She just won't listen anymore  
But let her find a way  
And soon'll come a glorious day  
When everything's been sorted through  
The streets will be reported  
How people congregate to feel the love within her heart

To take a walk, just a little walk

Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others' arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
I held a knife against his breast  
As into my arms he pressed  
He cried ""my love, don't you murder me  
I'm not prepared for eternity""  
  
I wandered home 'tween twelve and one  
I cried, ""My God, what have I done?""  
I've killed the only man I love  
He would not take me for his bride  
  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others' arms entwine

Your pain is now through  
Please forget those teardrops  
Let me take them from you  
The love you are blessed with  
This world's waiting for  
So let out your heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door  
It's time we start smiling  
What else should we do  
With only this short time  
I know to be here with you  
And the tales you have taught me  
From the things that you saw  
Makes me want out your heart, please, please

Surrounding herself with phonies and fools

Once I realized how foolish I've been

And now it's time for us to lose control  
Take me in your arms like you did before

Here is what Christmas time means to me  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of streetlights, even stop-lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, hear the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day  
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  
Never moan, they're happy to be working  
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields

Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain

Olivia Newton-John,The Right Moment,/o/olivia+newton+john/the+right+moment_20103241.html,"Spinning on another wheel  
Going round in slow motion  
Caught up in another dream  
Drifting on a blue ocean  
When you gonna reach out  
Only you can turn your world around  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
But you don't want to start just yet  
You watch the seasons come and go  
You remember and then you forget  
All along the way  
You can make a better life  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
You can find another way  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
When you gonna let go  
And forget about the life you knew  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
Now you know that it's all borrowed time  
Still you waste another day  
But you watch and you wait for a sign  
All along the way

Olivia Newton-John,The Rumour,/o/olivia+newton+john/the+rumour_20103251.html,"This is the last time  
I'll look across this table  
And try to face a feeling I don't even recognize  
This is a sad hand  
That reached across and touched you  
When all we'd built around us came crashing to the ground  
  
There was a tide turning  
Somewhere deep inside us  
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears  
Oh there were good times  
But in between the dog days  
I felt the pain of rumour whisper in my ears  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no  
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
As the rain falls  
I listen to the radio  
And try to memorize the words to ""Georgia On My Mind""  
But we're no old song  
We never stood the test of time  
The lies inside the rumour left trust so far behind  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no  
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
And when we say goodbye  
Be sure to look me in the eye  
And know the real secret  
Was the thing we didn't have to hide  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no

You see my fascination  
Tell me I'm not mistaken  
Give me the information I need  
One, two, three

And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you

Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach?  
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet  
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free  
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze?

Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last  
No point regretting that it went so fast  
Time that we had was like sand in our hands  
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine  
  
I remember taking you home on that 86  
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss  
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street  
If you remember just how scared I use to be

I don't wanna be your fool  
Pick me up whenever you want it  
Throw me down when you are trough  
Cause I've learned more from what's missing  
It's about me and not about you  
I know I made some bad decisions  
But my last one was you...  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me googbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Verse 2]  
You say I can do it better  
Better than someone like you  
What I feel, can't write in a letter  
So I wrote this for you  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me goodbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over

Like a fall in a war, like a mother's open arms.  
Like a pawn in a game, hard to take.  
There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and pray.  
  
All the time we are gone, there's no reason, there's no way.  
Oh, the soul is the one so they say.  
There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and play.  
  
She never thought he'd be this way.  
Her arms aloft, she holds.  
But now it's all a memory.  
And it's gone...

Baby you're my only reason

The shell of a man who could never be his best

It was there, I saw it in your eyes

With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?

And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone

He'd kill me without any warning

With a sign on my back saying kick me

Feels like I'm constantly playing  
A game that I'm destined to lose  
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend

Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

We're just one big family, and  
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved

It cannot wait I'm sure

Scooch on over closer dear  
And I will nibble your ear

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and laughed

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Don't care if critics ever jump in line

My God, amazing how we got this far  
It's like we're chasing all those stars  
Who's driving shiny big black cars  
And everyday I see the news  
All the problems that we could solve  
And when a situation rises  
Just write it into an album  
Send it straight to gold  
I don't really like my flow, no, so  
  
Tell me what you want to hear  
Something that are like those years  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics never jump in line  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
  
Oh, got no reason, got no shame  
Got no family I can't blame  
Just don't let me disappear  
I'mma tell you everything  
  
So tell me what you want to hear  
Something that'll light those ears  
Sick of all the insincere  
I'm gonna give all my secrets away  
This time, don't need another perfect lie  
Don't care if critics never jump in line

Hours brought thirst and the rising sun  
  
Sun birds leave their dark recesses  
Shadows gild the archways  
  
Do not turn your face towards me  
Confronting me with my loneliness  
You are in a forest unknown  
The secret orchard  
And your voice is vast and achromatic  
But still so precious  
  
Lullaby of the crescent moon took you  
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face  
Granted you a hollow stare  
Another soul within the divine herd  
  
I have kept it  
The amaranth symbol  
Hidden inside the golden shrine  
Until we rejoice in the meadow  
Of the end  
When we both walk the shadows

The evening trees moan as if they knew  
At night I always dream of you

You have nothing more to find.

Long awaiting their king.

So there I was.  
Within the sobriety of the immortals.  
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.  
The garden sighs, flowers die.  
The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.  
She could not see me through the windows.  
In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.  
Graven face, she said my name.  
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.  
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.  
And I cried, I knew she had lied.  
Her obsession had died, it had died.  
When can I take you from this place?  
When is the word but a sigh?  
When is death our lone beholder?  
When do we walk the final steps?  
When can we scream instead of whisper?  
When is the new beginning,  
The end of this sad Madrigal.

Opeth,Windowpane,/o/opeth/windowpane_20345134.html,"Blank face in the windowpane  
Made clear in seconds of light  
Disappears and returns again  
Counting hours, searching the night  
  
Might be waiting for someone  
Might be there for us to see  
Might be in need of talking  
Might be staring directly at me  
  
Inside plays a lullaby  
Slurred voice over children cries  
On the inside  
  
Haunting loneliness in the eye  
Skin covering a secret scar  
His hand is waving a goodbye  
There's no response or action returned  
  
There is deep prejudice in me  
Outshines all reason inside  
Given dreams all ridden with pain  
And projected unto the last

May the lord eternal save his troubled child  
As he passes through rain and storm  
Behind the walls of this hallowed ark of wood  
Our prophets found a revelation, which they have understood  
Onto the lands of fearful heaven comes a flood erasing all  
Landing as if a ruthless bird of prey to crush all human souls  
  
The lighting colors the sky with flames of light  
Hell shines above us and the fires bright  
Erasing the works of the common man, all we hold dear is set alight  
  
Hebrew lyrics (2)  
  
Shattered glass reflects this shattered world barren is the landscape here  
Thunder roars as a lion caged, heat that comes like waves of fear  
Oceans rise and rage as we watch the world powers fall  
Redeeming their sinful ways with their souls  
May the truth fill their hearts, let them see the light, when they embrace
their gods

Seas cover the works of timeless art  
That once brought joy to human hearts  
In halls of infamy this day shall live

Like the fire raised at the witches' stakes  
  
Return all earthly possessions  
As ashes you return to earth, child of God, to face the divine lord who sits
upon the throne - eyes sad  
Go in peace and thy faith  
Evolve thy self and lose all hate  
So a heaven you may create  
  
In this world of sorrowful ways  
None shall live to see the light of day  
Some may survive to tell this tale  
If their belief shall conquer this gale  
Damnation is the punishment bestowed

Don't lose all faith cause you shake at night  
It's in the art of the process.  
In another rhyme beyond this place.  
The healing's fast enough...  
Done a thousand times a thousand ways until  
You've had enough...  
It's mercy you're asking for cheating life  
By taking more it's mercy you're asking for  
Take my life or give me more...  
The loss of prize possession to cure the mind's obsession  
Could trade your soul for that normal life  
Elite to all objections...

Up lose all confidence at your expense your courage swallows up

But it must remain clear that the two depend on each other  
Remember, evil is a part of the good and not the opposite  
There is no sadness without joy and there is no joy without pain  
There is no holy without impure and there can be no blasphemy without
holyness,  
Thus the two sides must live in harmony  
Unbalanced forever the evil urge brought lots of pain  
It is so hard to defeat it  
The evil urge sometimes arrives with heavy boots  
And sometimes in gentle cat's steps  
And even through blessed deeds it can drive you into deeds of wrong  
A here is the one which concurs his urge

I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true  
About how girls are put upon by men  
I know I musn't fall into the pit  
But when I'm with a feller  
I ferget!  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
I'm in a terrible fix  
I always say 'come on, let's go'  
Just when I oughta say 'nix'  
  
When a person tries to kiss a girl  
I know she oughta give his face a smack!  
But as soon as someone kisses me  
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!  
  
I'm just a fool when lights are low

I ain't the type that can faint  
How can I be what I ain't  
I cain't say no

And starts to talk purty  
Whatcha gonna do?  
Supposin that he says  
Your lips are like cherries  
Or roses or berries  
Whatcha gonna do?  
  
Supposin that he says  
That yer sweeter than cream  
And he's gotta have cream or die

And do fer him what he would do fer me

In a sombero and chaps  
Soon as I sit on their laps  
Somethin' inside of me snaps

Kissin's my favorite food  
With or without the mistletoe  
I'm in a holiday mood!  
  
Other girls are coy and hard to catch  
But other girls ain't havin' any fun  
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match  
I have a funny feeling that I won  
  
Though I can feel the undertoe  
I never make a complaint
