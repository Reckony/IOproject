Westlife,Loneliness Knows Me By Name,/w/westlife/loneliness+knows+me+by+name_20145896.html,"Loneliness is always looking for a friend  
It found me once and it has been around since then  
Loneliness is never waiting by the door  
It sweeps right through and it will never be ignored  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Loneliness knows everything I keep inside  
My endless thoughts in the silence of the night  
Loneliness is the one who made me see  
Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Less is more and that would be the vacant space  
The cried out tears and a never ending maze  
I have found what only loneliness provides  
A strength within knowing I will find

Westlife,Lost In You,/w/westlife/lost+in+you_10186824.html,"There's no more waiting

I get lost in you  
  
What is this feeling  
I've never known before?  
That I should touch you  
Swearing to surrender ever more  
That's what I came here for

Lost in your wonderful ways

With no shoes upon my feet  
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat

In your sea of broken dreams  
When all your hopes are sinking  
Let me show you what love means

Love can build a Bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a Bridge  
Don't you think it's time?  
Don't you think it's time?  
  
I would whisper love so loudly  
Every heart could understand  
That love and only love  
Can join the tribes of man  
I would give my heart's desire  
So that you might see  
The first step is to realize  
That it all begins with you and me

It's our finest hour  
We can do anything, anything  
Anything, anything

Talk to you

And just reach out your hands

Westlife,Seasons In The Sun,/w/westlife/seasons+in+the+sun_20145957.html,"Goodbye to you my trusted friend  
We've known each other since we were nine or ten  
Together we've climbed hills and trees  
Learned of love and ABC's  
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees  
Goodbye my friend it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that spring is in the air  
Pretty girls are everywhere  
Think of me and I'll be there  
  
We had joy, we had fun  
we had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed  
Were just seasons out of time  
  
Goodbye Papa please pray for me  
I was the black sheep of the family  
You tried to teach me right from wrong  
Too much wine and too much song  
Wonder how I got along  
Goodbye Papa it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in the air  
Little children everywhere  
When you see them, I'll be there  
  
We had joy, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song  
Like the seasons have all gone  
We had joy, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song  
Like the seasons have all gone  
  
Goodbye Michelle my little one  
You gave me love and helped me find the sun  
And every time that I was down  
You would always come around  
And get my feet back on the ground  
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in the air  
With the flowers everywhere  
I wish that we could both be there

Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

And the road has been too long

Lies the seed

In the spring

With my home across the street  
I ain't got no place to turn to now  
While you're cooking for that creep  
  
What's the answer to this pain  
I want to get back to her love again  
There she's sitting in that room  
  
When she walked 'cross the street  
Could she feel there's a heat  
From my heart as it beats with her love  
In her eyes other guys, see the fair that is there  
But she might never know  
But she might never know  
  
As I turned so she waved, this was all that she gave  
So what was there to trade in love  
Just the past that was cast, in the groove of the move  
That she might never know  
She might never know

Dear mummy, dear daddy,  
You had plans for me, I was your only son.

You knew just what he would become.  
  
Run along to school,  
No child of mine grows up a fool,  
Run along to school.  
  
When you tried to tell me what to do,  
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you,  
One thing that I know for sure

They made rules for fools, so get wise

I'm handsome, tall, and strong.  
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me,  
As if to say ""Hell, what went wrong?""  
  
Where were you last night?  
You look as if you had a fight.  
Where were you last night?  
  
Well I think that you may just be right,  
But don't try to keep me in tonight,  
Because I'm big enough to break down the door.

We can't help but worry,  
You're in such a hurry,  
Mixing with the wrong boys,  
Playing with the wrong toys.  
Easy girls,  
And late nights,  
Cigarettes, and love bites  
Why do you have to be so cruel?  
You're such a fool

I've heard it all before  
There it goes again, the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says ""put your troubles down beside me""  
Things have always been the same  
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight

A red hot town where the girls are pretty

Chasing my dream down the line  
Heading out for trouble,

Sniffing around your door  
In the still of the night  
I feel my heart beating heavy  
Telling me I gotta have more.  
  
Now I just want to get close to you  
An' taste your love so sweet  
And I just want to make love to you  
Feel your body heat.  
  
In the still of the night  
  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night.

All I'm dreaming of  
I just can't let the feeling go  
  
After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
Now the world is full of wonder  
You've turned my life around in just one day  
I love the spell you've put me under  
Just one kiss can take my breath away

After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
All the lonely days and nights  
Were well worth going through  
I'm so glad I didn't give my heart away  
So I could give it all to you  
  
I've been waiting such a long time  
For a love that's real to come my way  
Gonna take some getting used to  
Now that love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now

And I'm realizing that  
You're not coming back  
And it's finally hit me all at once  
All at once I've started counting teardrops  
And at least a million fell  
My eyes began to swell  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And that's all that matters now  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
  
I looked around and found that you were  
With another love  
In someone else's arms  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
All at once the smile that used to greet me  
Brightened someone else's day  
She took your smile away  
And left me with just memories all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone

In my own head thinking  
How you could be staring in  
Got my number too  
And I'm writing you  
Contemplating on the paper what I should do  
On the fireplace with the mail man  
Should I tell you or should I hold it in  
If my heart wasn't in it  
Baby you could just forget it  
I'd be gone in a New York minute  
  
You never give me attention  
I know you never had bad intentions for us  
So I'm writing you but I always fail to mention  
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss  
So I'm gonna hold it in

I tried to stay but it never got better  
I couldn't tell you face to face but I,  
I had to let you know  
Sometimes I want to hit the door  
(I'm writing you Dear John)  
Sometimes I think that I've had enough  
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough,  
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks,  
You know I'm listening  
Some days I'm really touchy and  
Some days I'm willing to forget and  
Some days I'm still in love with you  
Some days I'm sad and blue  
  
When I don't check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I know that it's not just you  
It's some of my negligence too  
And I can't go through with mailing this to you

No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide  
Looking back, I could have played it differently  
Learned about the man before I fell  
But I was ever so much younger then  
  
Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine)  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
  
Didn't I know how it would go  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart  
  
Wasn't it fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
But in the end, he needs a little more than before  
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took some to understand him  
Hoo ooh I know him so well

Sinking to rise no more  
Searching for that open door

Led to my regret

Nothing to do but lift my head

Whitney Houston,Love Will Save The Day,/w/whitney+houston/love+will+save+the+day_20146423.html,"Sometimes life can make you crazy  
It can really put a body to the test  
You try so hard to make sure everything is right  
And you find you've only wound up with a mess  
  
It's a common situation  
Even though you feel abandoned and alone  
Child, you ain't the first to experience a hurt so  
Don't panic when you bit the danger zone  
  
What you need's a little change of heart  
Forget this fear and frustration  
Love will always play the greater part  
When you battles wear you down  
Here's my advice  
  
When you're feeling down and out  
And you're got troubles on your mind  
Love will save the day  
When you're feeling full of doubt  
And fear has got you in a bind  
Love will save the day  
  
When your world's falling apart  
All you got to do is say a prayer  
And love will save the day  
There's answer in your heart  
So let your light shines, my dear  
And love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
  
Many things in this world bring you down  
It's a wonder you can make it through the day  
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep  
And there's always something getting the way  
  
And when you turn on the evening news  
Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see  
Well there's no question  
That we need a new direction cause  
We all could use dome peace and harmony  
  
What you need's a little change of heart  
Forget this fear and frustration  
Love will always play the greater part  
When you battles wear you down  
Here's my advice  
  
When you're feeling down and out  
And you're got troubles on your mind  
Love will save the day  
When you're feeling full of doubt

There you were again (there you were)  
Oh these lonely times  
They never seem to end  
You're too far  
I know I should be there where you are  
  
Today I did some shopping  
Just had to clear my mind again  
I can't stop thinkin' bout you  
I hopped into a taxi  
In a moment I was home  
Home again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tossing and turning in my sleep  
I can't take being without you  
I'm gonna catch the next plane out  
I got to get to where you are  
No matter how near or far  
I got to get there where you are  
I know

I want to be where you are  
I need to be where you are  
I want to be I want to be baby

Whitney Houston,Who Would Imagine A King,/w/whitney+houston/who+would+imagine+a+king_20146413.html,"Mommies and daddys always believe  
That their little angels are special indeed  
And you could grow up to be anything  
But who would imagine a king  
  
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be  
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea  
Or maybe a carpenter building things  
But who would imagine a king  
  
It was so clear when the wise men arrived  
And the angels were singing your name  
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive  
That's what heaven stood to proclaim  
  
One day an angel said quietly  
That soon he would bring something special to me  
And of all those wonderful gifts he bring  
  
Who would imagine, who could imagine  
Who would imagine a king

Born in the war  
Birthday punching.

He says he likes a man who's dressed in season  
But no-one else ever stares, he's being so kind

Everybody hears me  
But I look like a fool now  
With a cry and I shy out

But it's nice to find a woman who's keen on living

Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you

It was more than a handshake then  
I know it still is  
But there's a plain fact  
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs  
I get the willies  
People know nothing about their own soft gut  
So how come they can sum us up  
Without suffering all the hype we've known  
How come they bum us up  
  
How many friends have I really got?

She was happier than she'd ever been  
As he praised her for her grace  
But his expression changed, she had seen  
As he leant to kiss her face  
  
It ended there  
He claimed a late appointment  
She quickly turned  
To hide her disappointment  
  
She ripped her glittering gown  
Couldn't face another show, no  
Her deodorant had let her down  
She should have used Odorono

That Sally couldn't go to the meeting  
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce  
And she ran inside weeping  
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture  
Of the new Messiah  
She picked up the book of her father's life  
And threw it on the fire  
  
[Chorus]  
She knew from the start  
Deep down in her heart  
That she and Tommy were worlds apart  
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part  
Is to be what you'll be.""  
  
The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,  
Love will find a way',  
So Sally decided to ignore her dad  
And sneak out anyway  
She spent all afternoon getting ready  
And decided she'd try to touch him  
Maybe he'd see that she was free  
And talk to her this Sunday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She arrived at six, and the place was swinging  
To gospel music by nine  
Group after group appeared on the stage  
And Sally just sat there crying  
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture  
Right in the very front row  
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge  
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy hit the stage  
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed  
The crowd back in a rage  
  
But soon the atmosphere was cooler  
As Tommy gave a lesson  
Sally just had to let him know she loved him  
And leapt up on the rostrum  
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure  
And touched him on the face  
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man  
Threw her off the stage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down  
Mingling with her tears  
Tommy carried on preaching  
And his voice filled Sally's ears  
She caught his eye, she had to try  
But couldn't see through their lights  
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men  
Had to carry her out that night  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy left the stage  
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch  
And a gash across her face, oh  
  
Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said  
""Don't say I didn't warn you.""  
Sally got married to a rock musician  
She met in California  
Tommy always talks about the day  
The disciples all went wild  
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek  
To remind her of his smile

Nothing ever goes as planned,  
I just couldn't face going home  
It was just a drag on my own.  
They finally threw me out  
My mother got drunk on stout,  
My dad couldn't stand on two feet,  
As he lectured about morality.  
Now I guess the families complete,  
With me hanging round on the street  
Or here on the beach.  
  
The girl I love  
Is a perfect dresser,  
Wears every fashion  
Gets it to the tee.  
Heavens above,  
I got to match her  
She knows just how  
She wants her man to be  
Leave it to me.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat  
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
I see her dancing  
Across the ballroom  
UV light making starshine  
Of her smile.  
I am the face,  
She has to know me,  
I'm dressed up better than anyone  
Within a mile.  
  
So how come the other tickets look much better?  
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.  
How come the girls come on oh so cool  
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?  
  
Come sleep on the beach  
Keep within my reach  
I just want to die with you near  
I'm feeling so high with you here.  
I'm wet and I'm cold  
But thank God I ain't old  
I should have split home at fifteen  
Why didn't I ever say what I mean?

What did I see?  
Where have I been?

Even if it takes a million years  
  
The song is over

Searchin' for a note, pure and easy  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by

How do you feel when the pollen falls  
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls  
  
And they're all in love

Where the past is the hero and the present a queen  
Just tell me right now where do you fit in

Stay young and stay high

I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me  
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish  
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around  
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it, as my tears fall again  
It's only by the music I'll be free  
There's something in the whisper of the trees  
Millions hear it, still they can't believe  
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves  
As an empire of dead men leave their graves  
Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls  
Don't listen to me or words from men above  
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds  
Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing

Blind to it, as my tears fall again

Becomes part of the machine.

Always playing clean.

Can't hear those buzzers and bells,  
Don't see lights a flashin'  
Plays by sense of smell.  
Always has a replay,  
'N' never tilts at all

The Bally table king.  
But I just handed  
My pin ball crown to him.  
  
Even on my favorite table  
He can beat my best.  
His disciples lead him in  
And he just does the rest.  
He's got crazy flipper fingers  
Never seen him fall

Spun in with a craftsmans weave  
Wound so tightly to protect him from the light  
And all shapes of water that drop from the leaves  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew he would be a chiller  
And he wound it tighter some more  
Wound it so wide and the ends of his legs got sore.  
  
He said, ""No, now I can't feel my feet  
Just when I thought it was time to take a stroll on down the street  
I'm leaving, looks like I can't leave  
What do you know?  
What's all this moving around with inside me?  
  
What kind of 'piller could touch the world of a miller  
Chopping trees to build a new store  
Nobody sees a lonely bump on the tree  
Except a lump who's crying for more  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a chiller as he wound it tighter
some more  
Anybody stands in the caterpillar's place is moving in a standing run  
  
He said, ""No brother, I just need some room to fly,  
I spent all of my days just trying to keep dry  
Oh I'd take a waterfall or a drop from my eye  
I can't see nothin' from here anyway, I might as well make room and try  
Might as well try  
  
Oh no, I just need a little room to play

Put a little money in those hats and those tins  
Give them hope in a hopeless world  
  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
Searchin' for love in these hateful times  
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak  
Ease my mind, ease my mind  
  
And on the corner there stands a young girl  
The home she left was in the better part of town  
Daddy did things she never talked about  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Somebody out there gotta listen  
Somebody out there got to know what Pops been talkin' about  
Raise your hand, raise your hands if you're with me  
Give us hope in a hopeless world  
  
You've got to listen to the voice inside  
Peace and love don't compromise, realize  
Time is passing by  
Can't be standing still!

A land of sunny rocks and funny trees  
I guess (Yes,) I'm on the moon again  
A heavy earth exchange a lighter breeze  
Got no coat and got no money  
A pair of tennis shoes to last through May  
A crater for an outdoor pool  
A few good cats to help me pass the day  
  
Havin' a good time, here today  
Watching the sun shine, matinee  
Never the wrong time, time we stay  
Living the moontime, time we play  
  
From here I watch the world go by  
Working in the moon-time bar and grill  
The word from Earth my time is up  
But here upon the moon time stands still  
Got no telecommunications  
Cables haven't gotten out this way  
The man in the moon is a musician  
That's the way we pass the lunar day  
  
Havin' a good time, here today  
Watching the sun shine, matinee  
Never the wrong time, time we stay  
Living the moontime, time we play  
Living the moontime, time to live it up!

I told her roll around little she'll be alright  
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face  
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place  
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya  
And hopefully your burnt Gucci dress will remind ya  
Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy why yall  
But if you want to play hunny go get a baby doll  
Holla at me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh uh huh  
Check and make sure I'm looking cute for huh  
Check and make sure I'm packing lute for huh  
Cause I'm about to shut down the bar for huh  
And later open up my car door for huh  
7 PM I leave the set and then  
No more acting back to rapping again  
Red carpet hectic getting me in  
What happened last week sure it could happen again  
Mos def full funk when ya looking at the front looking like a jet magazine
beauty of the month  
Shades low laying liggy low on the cut  
Told myself you're the one to shake it up with  
Bounce  
Over to your table can get me on announce  
Observe the curves body fat about an ounce  
Hormones pumping out dangerous amounts  
Grabbed ya arm turn around girl  
Jump  
Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front  
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want  
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling  
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Come on  
Jump on  
The only floor is jumping  
Come on  
Just let it flow (jump on)  
Act like you know

Hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large

Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen  
My whole auroa gleamin'  
Who that kid in the green v  
Envy brother schemin'  
  
I ain't thinkin' bout them  
Racing chicks in the pink b.m.  
With my speakers tweakin'  
Freakin' off this weekend  
  
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers  
Money can't break us but the places it can take us  
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight  
And we goin' have some fun tonight

Now how we do it  
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)  
Now how we doin' it  
(you know it's Big Willie style)  
  
I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down (boom)  
Non bettin' willie watchers standin' around  
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us  
How bad they want to be us (parlay)  
  
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack  
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black  
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar  
A round for everybody with these big willie cards  
  
From civllians to stars they want to know who we are  
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar  
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit

It's Left Eye with a tight crew  
Representin' like it's ladies night  
Comin' right through  
Don't be spiteful  
  
Plus an eyeful  
Sportin' hot pink  
Rocks in the link  
In the drop with a mink  
  
Like my shit don't stink  
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm  
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot  
Left Eye ready for action  
  
The main attraction  
I'm in the fast lane passin'  
Breakin' you down like fractions  
While we be rappin' about things that really happen  
  
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen  
With mademouselle from gezals to versace  
With a sweet smell  
This female leadin' the posse  
  
Got jokes like Cosby  
In the lots where the cars be  
With no apologies it's Left Eye  
Big Will let the champagne spill  
  
Is it a mans thing for real  
Can us girls roll wit y'all  
What the deal

Convoys and whips on the strip  
Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick

Entertainer  
Gold handle cane and matchin' gators  
Swervin' lane  
  
In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition  
In soul position and can rock a whole convention  
Movie screens to the club scene  
My whole crew lookin' clean  
  
Shine with a diamond gleam  
Step above where the players be  
Don't hate me  
One is where they rate me

Behind the door marked V.I.P.  
Eating grapes under the A.C.

Yo, yo, yo, yo

Point Blank  
My name to be etched in stone  
My destiny preordained  
Trying to live righteous  
Fighting for life, this my life  
That's why I liked on my vices  
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless  
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless  
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi  
You and your boys trying to decide, what to write  
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged  
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered  
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted  
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid  
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz,  
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge.  
  
Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends  
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen  
Giving false accounts of your account's amounts  
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception  
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish  
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I won't shield my eyes

Will Smith,Chasing Forever,/w/will+smith/chasing+forever_20146936.html,"Early mornin' wake up  
Gently with the Caress on your hand  
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan  
Sunshine peekin' through the venitian blinds  
  
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time  
I got a question, if the prodda dressin' and the Gucci  
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci  
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough  
  
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?  
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin' for real  
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel  
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine  
  
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw  
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more  
We could deal with whatever together  
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin' forever  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to stay with you forever  
I want to spend all my life with only you  
I want to stay, lets stay together  
Chasing forever, with only you  
  
Chasin' forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene  
Should we pursue with somethin' real or just chasin' a dream  
Or casin' the scene  
Fore I die I plan  
  
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands  
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure  
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature  
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good  
  
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work  
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind  
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine  
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust  
  
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous  
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight  
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right  
It's a race to a strange place, most see never  
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel  
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no  
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain  
You searchin' for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'  
  
Finally found a person, worthy of all  
Instead of pushin' me down, you want to cushion my fall  
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing  
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring  
  
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week  
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek  
I'll tell you what I see in the future  
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin' you mom and callin' me dad  
  
Havin more good times than JJ had  
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it  
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

You know then I mess around I go world trade on them  
Bangin' out them multi-plastic still got negativity to bring  
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing  
  
Take your place allow me to flex a taste  
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase  
Face me the star of stage and TV  
My face be seen in almost every country  
  
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee  
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from west Philly

Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that

Hundred million dollar bill kid  
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid

Really don't act silly  
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly  
  
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus  
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers  
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah  
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up  
  
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa  
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada  
Vertex is me the magnanamous

Jealousy swinging on me made his attack  
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)  
You believe that  
It hurt me at first but it's cool  
  
Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel  
Now everywhere I turn a dead end  
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens  
And they be screaming out

Did you see it's that brother from

Now can I please get

Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic  
  
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent  
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me  
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe  
I like my steaks thick and my jets private  
  
And my son to ride in the cockpit  
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot  
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips  
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip

My life got flipped-turned upside down  
And I'd like to take a minute  
Just sit right there  
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  
  
In west Philadelphia born and raised  
On the playground was where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool  
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school  
When a couple of guys who were up to no good  
Started making trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  
  
I begged and pleaded with her day after day  
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way  
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.  
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  
  
First class, yo this is bad  
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.  
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?  
Hmmmmm this might be alright.  
  
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that  
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?  
I don't think so  
I'll see when I get there  
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  
  
Well, the plane landed and when I came out  
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out  
I ain't trying to get arrested yet  
I just got here  
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  
  
I whistled for a cab and when it came near  
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  
If anything I could say that this cab was rare  
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air'  
  
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes smell ya later'  
I looked at my kingdom  
I was finally there  
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

Crazy mama how your scent played with me  
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking  
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking  
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me  
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me  
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand  
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man  
I put my finger up don't say nothing  
He ain't here is he? We can play or something  
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him  
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him

Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma

Southwestern, crib like a villa  
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla  
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms  
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm  
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?  
  
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up  
From the hospital that first night  
Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right  
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset  
  
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette  
That night I don't think one wink I slept  
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept  
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt  
  
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself  
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please  
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs  
Love, knowledge, discipline too  
I pledge my life to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try  
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)  
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us, you and I  
  
Five years old, bringin comedy  
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me  
Just like me  
Wait an see gonna be tall  
  
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all  
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be  
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC  
Haha, I want to kiss you all the time  
  
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat  
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?  
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh  
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy  
  
I pledge to you, I will always do  
Everything I can  
Show you how to be a man  
Dignity, integrity, honor an  
  
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it  
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it  
It didn't work out with me an your mom  
But yo, push come to shove  
  
You was conceived in love  
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track  
Remember one fact, I got your back

It's a full-time job to be a good dad  
You got so much more stuff than I had  
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times

See me-I'm  
Tryin to pretend I know  
On my PC where that CD go  
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone  
  
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong  
But just in case  
It's my place  
To impart  
  
One day some girl's gonna break your heart  
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex  
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son  
Throughout life people will make you mad  
  
Disrespect you and treat you bad  
Let God deal with the things they do  
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too  
Always tell the truth, say your prayers  
  
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears  
You're living proof that dreams do come true  
I love you and I'm here for you

11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets  
By 18, I started seeing the sun in the streets  
My mom started trippin' on me  
Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully  
Like, I trust you but please call me  
And when you have kids of your own you'll see  
I'ma be here when all your friends won't  
But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand  
Now here I am with a family runnin' the lines she ran on me  
We ain't always see eye to eye but Mom, on your principles  
Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so  
I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck  
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck  
My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck  
She thought he was really and polite, Chuck  
And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitably  
You see Chuck, you gon' see me  
Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy  
Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies  
Flock like we was players from the NBA  
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say  
To this girl named Mya  
I was diggin', he told her I was a liar  
Told her I be cheatin' on women  
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'  
He told her her life would be better with him in it  
That's the friend I chose  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road

So take your fool telling me I told you so  
Momma used to say, ""Take your time young man  
I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand  
But, you'll always know exactly where I am  
And when I'm not there in my place the Lord will stand  
Will study the world, only the wise succeed  
And when you're eyes tell lies your heart should lead  
You're gonna do dirt we all gon' sin  
But when you realize it, apologize and never do it again  
Mom told me don't rush to get old  
If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold  
It's like possibilities too much to behold  
An emotional shield from life's blustery cold  
Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard  
Childish disregard 'cause my head was hard  
Now, no question opposed, ugh  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass  
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you  
What you say? She said.  
What you mean? He said.  
Boy don't you play, she said.  
What you mean? He said. Damnit.  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.  
You testing me? You messin up again  
You done boy.

The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today  
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen  
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasn't like that then.  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution.  
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot  
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation  
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor  
get your life in order

Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early  
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout  
Tried to help lead black folk the right route  
Delayed,Negative voices, many, once in prison  
for unwise choices that he once made  
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him  
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again  
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic  
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)  
So check the gift, everything no negative  
That's what happens when you  
steer black folk away from negative

Every now an' then I get a chance to smile,

It grows and grows but still, my eyes are dry.  
Though my heart is breakin', tears refuse to start,  
So I've got to find a new way to cry.  
  
I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.  
It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.  
And until I forget you and can smile again,  
I've got to find a new way to cry.

So far away from home so far away from home  
  
Don't know a soul who has not been battered  
Don't have a friend who feels at ease

I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
Looking back down at me smiled reassuredly  
I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The statue of liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower come on the ship that sails the
moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an American tune

The night you walked away  
With the one who promised you a life of joy  
You thought my life too simple  
And your was much too gay  
To spend it living with a country boy  
I'm writing you this letter  
I write you every day  
I hope that you've received the ones before  
But I've heard not one word from you  
And every day I pray  
That you will not forget your country boy  
While you're living in the city  
With riches round your door  
Is this your love  
Is this your kind of joy  
Or do you find  
There's something missing  
Does your heart cry out for more  
And do you sometimes miss your country boy  
  
A cottage in the country  
With roses round the door  
Could not compete  
With flashing city lights  
But it's all I have to offer  
Except for one thing more  
A heart so filled with love  
That it could die  
Well it's time to end this letter  
The light of dawn is near  
A lonely night has passed  
But there'll be more  
Just one more thing in closing  
For all the world to hear  
Come home I love you  
Signed your country boy

Willie Nelson,Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond Of Each Other,/w/willie+nelson/cowboys+are+frequently+secretly+fond+of+each+other_20649386.html,"Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  
Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas.  
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.  
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.  
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.  
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.  
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.  
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?  
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his
brother.  
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.  
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.  
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.  
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?

Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back  
  
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away  
Hear that lonesome whistle blow that's your cue and by now you know  
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee  
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my
trail  
  
This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away  
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right  
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me  
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your
flame  
  
And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away  
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low  
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line  
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be
long  
  
This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind  
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl let's rise and shine good
mornin' ya all  
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day  
When I kissed my baby in the station door the whistle blew like it never
before  
Of the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away

When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,  
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.

Down every lonely street that's ever been  
Stella blue. Stella blue.  
  
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying.  
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,  
Gonna make them shine, shine  
  
It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,  
There's nothing you can hold, for very long.

It seems like all this life was just a dream.

How much you mean to me.  
My world would end if ever we were through.  
I can't begin to tell you  
  
How happy I would be  
If I could speak my mind like others do.  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever we're apart,  
  
But when your near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart.  
So take the sweetest phrases  
  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
I've said them all to you.

We've been dreaming  
But who can deny,  
It's the best way of living  
Between the truth and the lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
See who I am,  
Break through the surface.  
Reach for my hand,  
Let's show them that we can  
Free our minds and find a way.  
The world is in our hands,  
This is not the end.  
  
Fear is withering the soul  
At the point of no return.  
We must be the change  
We wish to see.  
I'll come into your world,  
See trough your eyes.  
I'll try to understand,  
Before we lose what we have.  
  
We just can't stop believing  
Because we have to try.  
We can rise above  
Their truth and their lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear their silence  
Preaching my blame.  
Will our strength remain  
If their power reigns?

But I'd rather weight it out

No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent  
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich  
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit  
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since  
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips, wit'  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything)  
  
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring  
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me  
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you  
Take you places where they using different language to greet you  
Smile and shake when they meet you  
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get
enough of me  
'Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me  
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me  
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want  
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me  
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'ma need it in a rush  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more  
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure  
You don't even have to call me, just say my name  
I'll be right there waiting for you  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

Wit no metal to waist  
I flow great  
And that'll level ya face  
But I'll still let a nigga have it  
You talk greasy but you still a fagot  
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards  
I got my money right  
Game on top  
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock  
I'm from the city  
Of the triflin' hoods  
But when you see me  
Gotta smile on my face  
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good  
Yea, I dodged the hood  
Slums came up out that  
Rap game about that  
To gain pay wit out crack  
See Imma youngin' wit' too much on my plate  
To let some small change have a youngin' dumped in a cage  
I seen niggas make sells  
Niggas get knocked and make bail  
And take lives, they worries ain't jail  
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well  
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell  
But me I don't do much just keep to myself  
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth  
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self  
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf  
So I'm here  
For sum reason though they hate it to death  
The love's gone only hatred is left  
Only achin' and stress  
A king not be mistaken for less  
And this here is for the taking  
This is history in the making  
  
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust  
Cause the hate's from most of your own people  
They're fake and they're all see through  
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks  
Rather him be down in the dumps  
And out on his luck  
But I'll be damned if my grind stop  
My mind tickin' like the time watch  
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not  
Presently there  
I touch minds everywhere  
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near  
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare  
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair  
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life  
Son reached  
Deceased  
No time to blink or think twice damn  
Wonder when it gonna be my time  
To meet death  
I'm stressed need to ease my mind  
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine  
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine  
U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring  
And we all got problems  
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em  
The top, but I rose from the bottom  
And I'm here now  
Ain't no body harming young  
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young  
Ya time's up I'm just warning young  
Cause this here's for the taking,  
This is history in the making

My ink got her gone, Wanting to know who tattoos me  
Head game right, Just said she'd like to ride (Yeah)

Before I leave the club, I'll put her number in my sidekick  
Swagger on some different shit, She tell me that she like it

I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it  
I been at work on the grind for a minute  
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Countin' my benjis  
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it  
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish  
When you stay all on your grind you can get it  
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen  
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention  
I be so high, try me, come visit  
You make a choice, hope you like your decision  
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted  
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician  
Ain't fuck with me then she probably was trippin'  
Lightin' 'em up just like we electricians  
Get to this money, get high, my intentions  
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine

I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor  
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures  
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter

Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper  
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through  
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to  
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool

'Cause I be going hard, roll the camera  
Life just like a movie I'm the star  
Wish you was in my position  
You too broke to play the part  
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back  
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'  
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'  
Straight out the burg,' where we drink and we smash niggas  
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mayne  
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne

In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'  
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'  
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin' and we ain't sleepin'  
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'  
We just freakin'  
You rollin' with short dog baby  
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady  
Come to my house I give 'em everything they want  
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women  
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, G.H.B., Marijuana  
She can suck it if she wanna  
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends  
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend!

Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em  
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em  
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning  
If the flight is private, we probably should board it  
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it  
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing  
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know  
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches  
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show  
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow  
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go  
Started small but now we all in them bigger game  
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats  
You talk shit, I won't respond back  
What they gon' get, and you don't want that  
That nigga will forget the deal  
Remember what? get for real

My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille  
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker  
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga

I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once  
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'

Doing features while watching a double feature nigga

Now I just stunt on my own  
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best, homie that's what they call me  
It's lonely at the top, got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me  
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's  
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's  
My dime piece only recognize the best tree's  
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe  
You in her face (You in her face)  
I let her breath  
  
From debated on, to waited on  
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on

Bitches ain't say shit to me  
But now they won't leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone,  
'Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing, but they singing my songs  
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up, no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell 'em bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all  
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall  
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star  
Cause we are, young, gifted,  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions  
Yeah, I said it, motherfucking millions

You was unable plus earn advance  
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance  
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost  
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost  
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype  
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics

Break it down base, treble through my dancer

Here comes one-time the ball was so fine  
Heat is blazin' the kids were playin'  
His partner was shady tryin' to slave the babies  
  
Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in  
Brooklyn  
All this while he let the fiends cook it  
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up  
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up  
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy  
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady  
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'  
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens  
Even though her leg was bitten  
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins  
Paleface cop who done popped the desk  
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste  
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block  
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti  
And his black partner, he was scared to speak  
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street  
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks  
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat  
They call him desk duty, Robocop  
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the  
Block  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son  
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo  
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care  
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor  
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her  
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face  
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her  
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her  
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her  
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid  
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks  
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked  
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five  
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live  
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?  
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten  
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'  
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat  
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about  
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store  
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw  
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw  
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores  
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position  
Transformation from critical to, stable condition  
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical  
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical  
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it  
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it  
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up  
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up  
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts  
And for some, another way out, is music and sports  
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot  
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side  
Staying alive was no jive  
At second hands, moms bounced on old men  
So then we moved to Shaolin land  
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose  
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot  
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one  
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun  
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend  
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen  
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes  
Making my way on fire escapes  
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed  
The combination made my eyes bleed  
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all  
Sticking up white boys in ball courts  
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater  
Times is ruff and tuff like leather  
Figured out I went the wrong route  
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out  
Catchin' keys from across seas  
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's  
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin  
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival  
I peep at the shape of the streets  
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep  
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.  
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15  
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much  
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,  
The court played me short, now I face incarceration  
Pacin' going up state's my destination  
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us  
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff  
But as the world turns I learned life is hell  
Living in the world no different from a cell  
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base  
Smokin' bones in the staircase  
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess  
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed  
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?  
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth  
Who explained working hard may help you maintain  
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain  
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks  
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot  
Leave it up to me while I be living proof  
To kick the truth to the young black youth  
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer  
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear  
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted  
That what? That life is hectic

Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant  
Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit  
  
It's manifested the Gods work like appliances  
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences  
The ninth chamber leave you trapped inside my hallway  
You try to flee but you got clamped by the doorway  
  
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence  
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt now how you restin'

Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways  
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas  
Now that's a money thing  
Yo yo  
  
I was Dashing through the hood  
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray  
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way  
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine  
Yo son we gotta make that cream whether raps or Nixon times  
  
They call me Rollie, watch me polly with the wide body Dinali  
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey  
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki  
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy  
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block  
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy  
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy  
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti  
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby  
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giuliani  
like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi  
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party  
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body  
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me  
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky  
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread  
then call myself Collar Ratsi  
Professionally trained, I am for your artery  
I give the autographs but charge for photography  
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody  
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys  
Spark the broccoli, spas off this ghetto opery  
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse  
Seen  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
Come, come, come  
One for the dough, son  
Give me the reasons  
  
They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly  
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy  
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy  
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty  
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?  
While the stage catch shells from forceful gun play  
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack  
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back  
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart  
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart  
Brought to a halt from a front full assault  
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results  
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts  
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts  
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes  
It was layin' in the sip drive from chest five

Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em  
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em

Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check

So alarming, without a word being spoken  
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look  
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books  
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed  
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook  
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks  
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot  
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up  
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather  
Yet heavier than weight, when my mind state starts to break, take cover  
Over RZA instrumental, I'm damn near invincible, it's simple

Tell me, what are they like?  
They got holes in the top, five round holes  
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them  
But his fingers went right through the bone  
So then, they've... mastered it  
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?

Seeing police niggas reaching  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my...  
  
[Inspectah Deck]  
Fleeing the crime scene speeding  
Beefing leaving behind cream  
Not even peeping that I was leaking  
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten  
Still jakes are creeping  
Don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend  
Keep the ruger peeling who's squealing  
Few knew the dealings  
Keep the steel concealed in  
Cause we got no time for feelings  
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing  
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing  
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro  
They boost his ego path and broke down  
Reduced to zero  
Cops feel we poors hoping I'll reveal my source, source  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my soul  
Oh oh, oh oh

Outside the check cashing, flashing  
Dipped in fashion  
Five cherry-faced fagots tried to cash in  
They keep laughing, Ghost you get ya face bashed in  
Who gave you these privileges son? why you maxing?  
And we..  
Feigning to take those move slow  
I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose  
And I heard you keep a banging hammer  
Golden brass diamonds embroideries  
That was stolen that you haven't reported g  
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup  
Don't make this big stick up bigger  
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose  
Rather than froze  
Had the Jim star on my hand  
Yo what the fuck yo! that's when I ripped Timothy  
Snatch and dip john like imbaggable  
Had the mini axe tool, faxed him  
Shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dumb

To watch relationships get destroyed

Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

Playing with a dynamite stick, where did I go wrong?  
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp  
If ya lukewarm leavin' ya clothes and boots torn  
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's  
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on

What is hip-hop to hot nickels?  
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word

And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty  
Baggy Dun Gurees, dick need room to breathe  
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese  
Ain't no rules to the game  
If it is we ain't playin'  
In your business like EPMD, ""So whatcha sayin'?""  
You co-designin' that bullshit yo man tryin'  
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat  
Slugs flyin'

Yo, ya  
Check, the code echoes from magazines to the big screen  
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream, kids fiend  
From the urban to sub-urban  
Roll upon me thirstin' like ""Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant""  
We roll longer than dice in a casino  
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0  
Behind the tinted windows I lie low  
On some hydro tryin' to slide from the 5-0  
But now, get wild similar to Ol' Dirty  
On third time felon just hit with over 30  
No worries, style have 'em so thirsty  
First degree heats are quittin' on me  
Cold turkey, no mercy  
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines  
But a thousand shoutin' my name that's why I came  
But first bring the cash burst, then the outburst  
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse  
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle  
Trouble with ya here and face the tec-muscle  
Even the best buckle win, I take it to the extreme  
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get cream  
This life

It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what

Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants  
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent  
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar  
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up  
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes  
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast  
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp  
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps  
Back to the dormatory, where niggas  
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory  
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade  
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad  
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't  
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped  
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back  
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down

From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother  
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors  
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it  
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it  
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion  
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned  
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt  
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted  
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light  
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions  
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen  
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old  
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano

Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers  
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers  
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German  
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning  
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight  
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like  
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?  
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings  
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto  
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro  
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple  
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle  
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline  
Plump breasts, was filled with saline  
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine  
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team

Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?  
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?  
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets  
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding  
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus  
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit  
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room  
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker  
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener  
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel  
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional  
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in

Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest  
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider  
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?  
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?  
The unclean man from the unclean land  
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest  
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless  
Put a price on things, that are priceless  
The fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness  
Who really has the power, is is theirs, is it ours?  
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?  
Do we have a press or President?  
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?  
Who got the evidence?  
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence  
  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Let's start the show, c'mon!  
Let's go  
Say one, two, three, four  
  
I oversee the world  
You taught many of 'em, many dudes  
I'm moldin' rappers and showed 'em how to eat  
Chef, the senator of thoughts  
Democratic gats  
Saved by the judge  
The flavor, that was brought about that day  
Steaks come out, raw  
  
Say oh! Clap your hands

Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances  
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead  
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride

On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back

Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene

My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds  
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin  
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin  
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces  
  
[Break]  
  
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital

And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death

Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?

The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts

The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points

We was laughing, at all the girls that passed  
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss  
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)  
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far  
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!  
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer  
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner  
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""  
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""  
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.  
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block  
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)  
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete  
I picked him up, then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was  
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?  
It's always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time

But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma  
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck  
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed  
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give  
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next  
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real  
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal  
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do  
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt  
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you  
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory  
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story  
But he carried on, with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.  
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now  
No life to live, doc says two more years  
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

Verse One:  
  
  
Arrival of the Carnival  
  
New beats, I never recycle  
  
While your looking for samples  
  
You might get trampled  
  
Surprise, hey  
  
I'm back with lightning and thunder  
  
I heard you over saying that i was a one year wonder  
  
You dumb or some, i went to refugees  
  
Silly felony, when i'm done  
  
Collect royalty from record company's  
  
Clouds getting darker  
  
Suns getting nearer  
  
I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer  
  
The back of a building  
  
Your body's found by children  
  
Playin' hide go seek  
  
All we found was his skeleton  
  
In the back of a car  
  
You spawned with the wrong guard  
  
You know my empire strikes back hard  
  
Listen hard, war  
  
This is the day after action  
  
Projects, cannons  
  
Being launched at the palace  
  
Vision, revelation  
  
Sky know apocalypse  
  
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss

Verse Two:  
  
  
Aiyyo, Back on earth  
  
The party is in the tunnel  
  
On the west side of the river  
  
Went mad quiver  
  
Rats get fed to the alligator  
  
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor  
  
Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima  
  
I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror  
  
I was on the highway pushing a black viper  
  
A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper)  
  
A blue range rover, he says pull over  
  
I didn't know he was a DT undercover  
  
I screamed out my lungs  
  
This is discrimination!  
  
He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station  
  
Who me? not me! it couldn't be  
  
I was in the Grammys with Brandy  
  
Didn't you see me on tv?  
  
Bullshit, y'all all in the same game  
  
He tried to run me off the road  
  
Like he was rosco, rico or dre  
  
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show  
  
Cause when its time to go  
  
All i gotta press is turbo  
  
Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west  
  
Things got serious, that's when i bust a left  
  
you-Turn, my eyes burned  
  
My concern was a truck coming  
  
Head on collision within a chase position  
  
Close one, i almost went up in a blaze  
  
Running from what appears to be a masquerade  
  
Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind  
  
Reality stuck when i got to the borderline  
  
The headline reads every ghettos sad story  
  
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity...

Chorus repeat (2X)  
  
not, the record (fades out)

She said, ""Just keep all the lyrics hardcore""  
Listen to my talk and get up, I'm on the corner with my...  
  
Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck  
I got a story to tell, heeeeeeere we go  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof  
One night, he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose  
  
Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, what should I write next?  
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress  
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect call from Jeff  
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""  
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""  
""Yo, I got bad news""  
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the ill street blues  
""The friends will make you, then too can break you  
They plan an execution like Fu Man Chu""  
""Who?""  
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""  
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""

""Who used to sell bang""

""DT's found his hand in the back of Binnigans...""

""In a plastic bag with a note attached""  
""Saying what?""  
""A million and a half or he won't be back""  
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""  
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""  
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?  
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?  
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke  
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?

You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes  
You wanna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised  
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left  
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death  
You provoke the cycle, call Michael  
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh  
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple  
Like the colour, you holler, ballin' for your mother  
No-one hears you even though you knock  
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock  
Things done changed since your spark got hot  
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock

Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine

Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom  
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong  
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed  
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph  
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all  
Temperature forty below  
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold  
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa  
I can't front  
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense  
So I could see dead people

Realize I'm the same man my father was  
y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac  
The way I clean my ride  
Old grim tilted to the side  
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize  
About the philosophies of life in its reality  
Keep the right mentality  
Don't fall into vanity  
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me  
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here  
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you  
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you  
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil  
For the Lord is wit me  
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands  
You two were so close  
That I finally understand  
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters  
I'ma miss em  
No matter what I'mma be wit em  
Peace

Wyclef Jean,Fresh Interlude,/w/wyclef+jean/fresh+interlude_20147489.html,"Yo yo, this Wyclef, alongside DJ Skribble (for the ladies)  
Yo Skribble I have one question  
Could you please answer this for me?  
I gotta know this yo  
  
What makes a DJ  
What makes an MC  
What makes the ReFugees  
Why are kids getting jealous?  
  
'Cause we F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
  
Hey you, player, with the dibble and the dabble  
You want to battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble  
Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session  
Skribble where you from man  
Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey  
With a universal tag, plus I got  
You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art  
Bring your best MC's  
'Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival  
Show up, with a mic, and a rifle  
Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day  
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it ""oh my word""  
So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint  
He's shook, callin' Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint  
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden'  
I had to take him out ""Three the hard way!""  
The moral of this story don't blame the record company  
If your record ain't selling you lack creativity  
  
But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh?  
Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't  
What you want me to say?  
  
""And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against me!""

They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Aiyyo  
What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz ""My Love's Your Love"" will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange, shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one, look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial  
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being ""Born Again""  
It never happen, watch who you call fam  
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum, way before it happened  
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?  
C'mon!  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts

You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks  
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo  
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer  
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard  
Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church

Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say ""No Woman, No Cry"" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)

And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child  
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan

The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation  
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements  
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements  
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor  
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh  
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets  
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it  
Metal detectors replace music classes  
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses  
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose

Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts  
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks

First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door

When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English  
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas

And sa fa say, na boolay  
Grammy night, we took 3 away  
22 million sold, I can't believe this  
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?  
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
""Clef, your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones""  
No more struggling, good life we loving it  
You could live it too, if you only publish it  
So here we go, so what's the scenario?

Yo who you pushin' weight for  
Dog I ain't no rat  
Cause rats get found in the back of garbage trucks  
With they mouth taped up  
Lookin' like sittin' ducks  
Well you don't look like a sittin' duck and your mouth ain't taped up  
What more small the market, Clef  
You get stuck up  
With what  
From a fiend  
I just bought a twenty-two  
Now it's funny you should say that  
Cause the gun looks bigger than you  
Now get your ass back in the house  
Shut up!  
?  
From B.K. back to N.J.  
Crouchin' tiger style  
Let's go  
  
Feel it  
Feel it  
Peace God  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Peace God  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Speak God  
Wyclef Jean bout to hit the streets hard  
Peace God  
Peace  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Masquerade, my message to the streets, y'all  
  
Yo peace God  
These words came from a revelation  
Whether you free or you going through incarceration  
Inhale, exhale herbal meditation  
Put the fire arms away  
Cause we don't want no confrontation  
Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk  
Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork  
So, peace God, even through war we bring peace  
And after the blood shed then your first son deceased  
And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end  
The alpha, omega, the present, and the future  
So hold on to your Winchester  
Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester  
Peace God, even though we ice the wrist  
Guzzle the fifth  
Protect us with a crucifix, Lord  
And bless me with an extra clip  
So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye, yo peace God  
I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard  
But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card  
I wasn't born this way it just came to be  
Sellin' crack through a alley where the fiends rally  
Where the dealer was the president  
And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government  
And stick ups was only natural  
It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you  
Peace God  
Yo only God got the answer  
And sorry bout ya mom dyin' of cancer  
But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner  
You a big man now, the black Tony Montana  
But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy  
Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies  
Until we meet again feel my words through my pen  
And stay pure in the city of sin  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Yea, oh!  
Check me out, look  
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain  
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)  
And last album, they don't like me to tell this  
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)  
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody  
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies  
So they can lock us up one at a time  
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines  
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop  
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!  
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable  
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels  
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts  
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck  
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody  
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty  
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals  
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal  
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack  
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back  
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom  
Though I make big money, still handle small problems  
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit

I'm fat with the ink pen  
Like Ali Boom Bayay  
Okay I'm on my second wind  
Used to roll dice when the love was on my side, man  
Four, five, six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
D.A. on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone  
I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected  
Check it  
Like when I rhyme don't big punch wreck it  
Check it

Lyrical dagger like alcohol I got pull your liver

See that refugee local

Come chill on the spot with me

So get all your friends and your families and come along  
Move to the beat that's all we do  
We got Jerusalem  
Everyday we offer praises like King Soloman  
  
Don't be nervous  
I'm your guardian angel, I know you're nervous

The matterings of all matter  
Masters and their extended batters  
Internet intelligence firm  
Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable  
Man's mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Let's ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earth's water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields

It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down

DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many

I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain  
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy  
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD  
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard

I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""  
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""  
""When you get older now and you understand that""  
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""

She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose  
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at?

Ain't no such things as war heroes  
Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!)  
My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam  
Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on

She called her girl Mary  
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.  
She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely  
I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary  
So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?  
The devil said, ""Clef, take her ass home!""  
God says, ""Repect her, her man's in the pen""  
This kid pushed me from behind, ""Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!""  
Then his girl looked at me, she winked! I blinked!  
Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct  
Aww, cool-n-shit! I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp  
Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link  
He said, ""Son, do you know who I am?! I'm no man, but one man  
who? The son of Sam!""  
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation  
Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock! He released!  
then breathe, His aim went off balance  
The music got tense  
That's when I knew I was in trouble! The street is like a jungle!

It's too hot in New York man, give me  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet

So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
'Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home, mama whooped on my ass  
Said I'll be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin'  
Beatin' on his wife while the kids were watchin'  
Later that day we was out on the porch  
And fantasize we was out of New York, we woke up in

I'm in the club 'fore I entered the stadium  
I bring the vibe like the days of the Tribe  
Before I had the fame I was servin' the fries  
So who better to know about a nine-to-five  
Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes  
Now my daddy, he can rest in peace  
From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach, let's go

Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?

But it's gon' take more than words  
For you to be a father, uh-huh

You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home

Wait a minute girl! You're my joy, happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling  
You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time  
Studied all the words to the rhyme  
You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon  
There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight

But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care  
Be a man, no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow!

A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice

You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home

But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates  
Never thought you'd leave me alone  
  
Time through the rain has set me free  
Sands of time will keep your memory  
Love everlasting fades away  
Alive within your beatless heart  
  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love

Owaranai kanashimi wo aoi-bara ni kaete  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love

Owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Dry your tears with love  
If you could have told me everything  
You would have found what love is  
If you could have told me what was on your mind  
I would have shown you the way  
Someday I'm gonna be older than you  
I've never thought beyond that time  
I've never imagined the pictures of that life  
For now I will try to live for you and for me  
I will try to live with love, with dreams  
And forever with tears

No need to be hurt anymore  
  
You said, ""I miss you so much  
Every night thinking of you  
And facing loneliness""  
  
But when you feel sadness  
Never can I stay with you  
  
I'm not the one you need  
Close your eyes and forget me  
There's nothing I can do anymore  
  
I lost my way  
I've been walking in the night of tears  
There I found someone was holding you  
As the night was falling down  
With my love also vanished my vision of you

You said, ""I need you always  
Everyday thinking of you  
And living loneliness""

We're going to where no one has gone before

Thinking of when I would hold you gently  
And I'd look into your eyes  
And I would be the one to calm your shaking  
When you would cry  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life

You hide your answers within every smile  
Time and time again I'd lose my chances  
To reconcile  
Even if I had my time over  
It would take a while  
To reveal all my best intentions  
That I let slip by

From a far away land

Than the picture in his hand  
She had eyes  
That would draw him in  
They took a plane ride  
Together they would find  
Her long lost smile  
They went home again  
Back to her friends  
Back to repair her heart  
He loved this girl  
With all of his heart  
He wanted her mind  
Her secrets and her trust  
She would never do him any harm  
He'd give her the world  
If it sat in his palm  
One rainy day  
It was dark in the sky  
She turned and she said to him  
With grey in her eyes  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
His heart turned to liquid  
And it trickled from his eyes  
All he could do now  
At this point in his life  
Was to go home again  
Back to his friends

Cast away on a desert island...  
The game and coconuts is plentiful  
You pick 'em right off of a supermarket shelf  
And all the man-eaters are parked away  
Down in garages  
While their selfish owners drinking to escape  
Lord of flies with cocktails in his conch shell  
Don't rescue me, no  
This is my home sweet home dear  
Don't rescue me, no  
I am far from alone here  
Cast away on a desert island  
Me and one nation are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
Cast away on a desert island

XTC,Me And The Wind,/x/xtc/me+the+wind_20147768.html,"Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are pulling kites and pushing tress  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are feeling freer than air should ever be  
Should ever be should ever be should ever  
  
And when you lured me into your syrup  
All I could think of was what a lovely way for me to go  
I never really realised that  
  
Just like the struggling summer flies that  
I was drowning no matter how sweet or how slow  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you cracked the whip  
While you cracked the whip  
  
I danced imprisoned in your drumbeat  
Your tune of spring had me whirling like a mad march  
Merry hare  
It never really came to mind that  
  
The strings of your instrument were strangling me  
Inside their snare  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you held the hoop  
While you held the hoop  
  
Now that I'm out and I'm shouting in doorways  
Freed from a love more like murder  
I should be singing but in liberation  
Feel like a ship with no rudder  
  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Have I been such a fool

XTC,Melt The Guns,/x/xtc/melt+the+guns_20147731.html,"Programmes of violence,  
As entertainment,  
Brings the disease into your room.  
We know the germ,  
Which is man-made in metal,  
Is really a key to your own tomb.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
Children will want them,  
Mothers supply them,  
As long as your killers are heroes.  
And all the media  
Will fiddle while Rome burns,  
Acting like modern-time Neros.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
I'm speaking to the Justice League of America.  
The you S of A,  
Hey you,  
Yes you in particular!  
When it comes to the judgement day and you're standing at the gates with your
weaponry,  
You dead go down on one knee,  
Clasp your hands in prayer and start quoting me,  
'cause we say...  
Our father we've managed to contain the epidemic in one place, now,  
Let's hope they shoot themselves instead of others,  
Help to civilize the race now.  
We've trapped the cause of the plague,  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
If we listen quietly we can hear them shooting from grave to grave.  
You ought to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.

XTC,Merely A Man,/x/xtc/merely+a+man_20147794.html,"Higher.  
  
I'm a king, yes, I'm a head of state.  
But I'm the kitchen boy who'll wash your dirty plate.  
I had no message and the message was,  
We're all Jesus, Buddha, and the Wizard of Oz.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll be lifting humanity higher.  
Higher.  
  
I'm all religious figures rolled into one,  
Gaddafy Duck propelled from Jimmy Swaggart's tommy gun.  
Don't promise rainbows with some golden pot,  
In fact what I can offer I know you've already got.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.  
Higher!  
  
And you know it's true.  
We should chase superstition and fear from our hearts,  
If we're going to survive and take levels of sanity higher.  
Kick it up...higher.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.

XTC,Mermaid Smiled,/x/xtc/mermaid+smiled_20147810.html,"From pools of xylophone clear  
From caves of memory  
I saw the children at heart  
That we once used to be  
Borne on foaming seahorse herd  
Compose with trumpeting shell  
From lines across their hands  
A song as new as new moon  
As old as all the sands  
Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild  
Lost that child 'til mermaid  
Smiled  
  
Summoned by drum rolling surf  
As laughing fish compel  
The young boy woken in me  
By clanging diving bell  
Breakers pillow fight the shore  
She wriggles free in the tide  
I'm locked in adult land  
Back in the mirror she slides  
Waving with comb in hand  
I was lucky to remain beguiled  
Grown to child since mermaid  
Smiled

XTC,Miniature Sun,/x/xtc/miniature+sun_20147795.html,"I'm twelve o'clock,  
All daylight hours,  
I'll warm your bed,  
I'll grow your flowers.  
Like I'm a miniature sun.  
This ball ignited when she told me I was her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I'm king up here like a miniature sun.  
  
No life comes close,  
I'm rising higher,  
On holiday,  
On ball of fire,  
You made a miniature sun.  
There's no more shadows in this world she says I'm her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I radiate like a miniature sun.  
  
Now everything looks right today,  
A billion watts of bright today.  
And I'm a blazing kite today.  
I think I'll float around her house,  
And tell her exactly how she makes me glow.  
But then the other man leaving merely doffs his hat,  
And I'm the last to know.  
  
Now everything looks wrong today.  
An out of tune sung song today.  
I've grown from big King Kong today,  
Right down to miniature...  
  
Don't come too close,  
I'll burn your arm,  
I'll bleach your hair,  
Dustbowl your farm,  
I'll blind your eyes,  
You blinded mine,  
I'll spin with rage,  
All summertime,  
You made a miniature sun.  
Just take a look up in the nightsky, I'm not the only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that vain little boy that I was.  
I'm all to blame now,  
Look out below here I come!  
  
Man crashing down like a miniature sun

XTC,My Bird Performs,/x/xtc/my+bird+performs_20147776.html,"(Colin Moulding)  
  
Fine art never moved my soul  
No vintage wine designer clothes  
But my world shakes for me  
My bird sings sweetly  
A different kind of tinsel  
Decorates my tree  
Yes my bird performs  
A thousand Cheshire cats  
Grin inside of me  
Yes my bird performs  
There she goes  
Shakespeare's sonnets leave me cold  
The drama stage and the high brow prose  
But my world shakes for me  
My bird sings sweetly  
The brightest fireworks  
Are lighting up my sky  
Yes my bird performs  
The cage is open  
But she's no desire to fly  
'Cause my bird performs  
There she goes  
And you keep saying what you got  
You keep saying what you got  
Look out!
