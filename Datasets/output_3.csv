Britney Spears,Rebellion,/b/britney+spears/rebellion_20526391.html,"You might not believe it  
But trust me this is true  
You fall for their poison  
And become a part of their crew  
I'm in a rebellion  
And I'm up against the truth  
So will you join me?  
Or will you be taken too?  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
Your body starts breaking in  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
Be wary of others  
The ones closest to you  
The poison they feed you  
And the voodoo that they do  
But in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth  
Don't just stand there  
Do what you got to do  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
With everyone yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
The eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in  
I'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin  
But in rebellion there's a glimmer of light  
And nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion

Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out

And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop

Tried to talk about what's goin' on  
You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong""  
In your smile there's a sign in red  
It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""

Signed a note back to town  
It was there that the workers slaved all week  
Waiting for payday to come around  
  
Break out, come on if you're coming  
Cause baby i just can't stay  
I want to take out the walls of this joint  
I want to blow this town away  
  
Now i ain't into fast livin'  
I ain't into dying young  
And i ain't looking to be forgiven  
For any of the stupid things that i've done  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
A notion it was good to be alive  
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion  
I want to break out baby tonight  
  
I want to dream, that i got a place  
I want to scream in somebody's face  
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race  
All night long  
  
Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight  
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight  
It was down in the cool dirty living  
With the man with the master plan  
Some girl who can beg forgiveness  
And a ticket to the promised land  
  
Down where they'll tear your guts out  
Making out what you're all about  
Making while we were blasting like a ??  
I want out i want out i want out  
  
Want out to the outside  
Well i'm a small fool  
I want to shout i'm bound for nothing  
I want to shout about something too

It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive

I wanna win what ain't ever been won

Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line  
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard

He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need  
And then very carefully he'd proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name  
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light

As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing

Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, in the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning

Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake

Alright now  
  
And then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed  
As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well, electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well, tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, starry-eyed and laughing, I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah, tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused, misused, strung out ones and worse  
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
(Yeah)

Your kiss was taken from me  
Now all I have is this...  
  
Your kiss, your kiss, your touch, your touch  
Your heart, your heart, your strength, your strength  
Your hope, your hope, your faith, your faith  
Your face, your face, your love, your love  
Your dream, your dream, your life, your life  
  
I'm runnin' through the forest  
With the wolf at my heels  
My king is lost at midnight  
When the tower bells peal  
We've got no fairytale ending  
In God's hands our fate is complete  
Your heaven's here in my heart  
Our love's this dust beneath my feet  
Just this dust beneath my feet  
If I'm gonna live  
I'll lift my life  
Darlin' to you  
  
I'm countin' on a miracle  
Baby I'm countin' on a miracle  
Darlin' I'm countin' on miracle

You can see the lights going up out in Soldiers Field  
Getting ready, for the county fair

So come on, hey we're goin' down there

Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears

Now you'll be hangin' tight when we hit the top  
And that rollercoaster's ready to drop  
And your braggin', how you wasn't even scared  
Well baby you know I just love the sound  
Of that pipe organ on the merry-go-round

So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
At the north end of the field they set up a stand  
And they got a little rock and roll band  
People dancin' out in the open air  
It's James Young and the Immortal Ones  
Two guitars, (baby) bass and drums  
Just rockin', down at the county fair

We let that fortune wheel spin around  
Come on mister tell me what's waiting out there  
On my way out I steal a kiss in the dark  
Hope I can remember where our car's parked  
Baby, out at the county fair  
  
Now off down the highway there's the last stream of cars  
We sit a while in my front yard  
With the radio playin' soft and low  
I pull Carol close to my heart  
And I lean back and stare up at the stars  
Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go

You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
You said your love had never died  
You were waiting for me at home

I ran till I thought my chest would explode  
There in the clearing, beyond the highway  
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone  
I rushed through the yard  
I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard  
Up the stairs I climbed  
The room was dark, our bed was empty  
Then I heard that long whistle whine  
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried  
Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang  
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain

Keep up their rusty guns and went back home  
And the governor was sent down from population control  
And marshall all was past  
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith  
For the time for hope they passed

With death on their fingertips

Reached from the rocky mountains into the old dead sun

Burning in my soul

Bruce Springsteen,Galveston Bay,/b/bruce+springsteen/galveston+bay_20025044.html,"Fifteen years Le Bing Son  
Fought side by side with the Americans  
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam  
  
In '75 Saigon fell  
And he left his command  
And brought his family to the promised land  
  
Seabrook Texas and the small towns  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
It was delta country and reminded him of home  
  
He worked as a machinist, put his money away  
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin  
And together they harvested Galveston Bay  
  
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up  
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter  
Steer out through the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company  
In the highlands of Quang Tri  
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai  
And shipped home in '68  
  
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds  
In a boat that'd been his father's  
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son  
And cast his nets into the water  
  
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell  
And the Communists rolled into Saigon  
He and his friends watched as the refugees came  
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on  
  
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk  
Of America for Americans  
Someone said, ""You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out""  
And brought in the Texas klan  
  
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor  
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea  
In the fire's light shots rang out  
Two Texans lay dead on the ground  
Le stood with a pistol in his hand  
  
A jury acquitted him in self defense  
As before the judge he did stand  
But as he walked down the courthouse steps  
Billy said ""My friend, you're a dead man""  
  
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside  
Billy stood in the shadows  
His K-bar knife in his hand  
And the moon slipped behind the clouds  
  
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was as still as glass  
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass  
  
In the early darkness Billy rose up  
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water  
Kissed his sleeping wife  
Headed into the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Of Galveston Bay

We went back inside sat down had a few drinks  
But all he kept talking about was

Well there's a girl that lives up the block  
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads  
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess it's two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times,  
She says when she feels like crying  
She starts laughing thinking about

Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Think I'm going down to the well tonight  
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will  
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture  
A little of the glory, well time slips away  
And leaves you with nothing mister but

Untouched

He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down  
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime  
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99  
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away  
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""  
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make  
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away  
  
Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay  
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away  
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man  
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand  
  
Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead  
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head  
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time  
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that killin' line

Bruce Springsteen,Jungleland,/b/bruce+springsteen/jungleland_20025021.html,"The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map

Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
  
The kids asleep in the backseat  
We're just countin' the miles you and me  
We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore  
We just stack the bodies outside the door  
  
The wise men were all fools  
What to do  
  
The sun sets in flames as the city burns  
Another day gone down as the night turns  
And I hold you here in my heart  
As things fall apart  
  
A downtown window flushed with light  
Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five)  
A martyr's silent eyes  
Petition the drivers as we pass by  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate  
Strung up at your city gates  
And you're the last to die for a mistake

There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow  
I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else  
You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell  
You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell  
You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth  
Like you had no further use for, for life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time  
'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind  
Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart  
'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts  
  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
So here's one for the road  
Here's one to your health  
And to life itself, rushing over me

When you want to do something that's new  
And it seems really, really hard to do  
You feel like quitting, you feel you're through  
Well I have some advice for you  
  
Don't give up  
Keep on trying  
You're gonna make it  
I ain't lying  
Don't give up, don't ever quit  
Try and try and you can do it  
Don't give up, yeah  
  
If you want to catch a ball  
But you're having no luck at all  
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose  
It hits your belly, your chin and toes  
Well, try and try and try again  
Keep on trying until the end  
You put your hands out in the air  
You'll catch the ball  
Yes this I swear  
  
Don't give up,  
Keep on going  
You're on a boat,  
So keep on rowing  
Don't give up, don't ever stop  
Try and try and you'll come out on top  
Don't give up  
  
You got yourself rollerskates  
You put them on  
And you feel great  
You stand up  
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all  
You get back up, then you trip,  
You skip and tip and slip, and flip  
You try and try and try some more  
Soon you're skating across the floor  
  
Don't give up, keep on moving,  
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving  
Don't give up, don't pack it in  
Try and try, and you'll win  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no  
Don't give up!

Faced again with the same mistakes,  
So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,  
But life proves me wrong everytime,  
Takin roads that lead me nowhere,  
How do I expect to get there,  
But when will I learn to just put you first.

I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on. Can I move on.  
(Oh)  
When I awake it's you that makes  
Me strong,  
And I know that you've been with me all along,  
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,  
With you life is so easy why do I  
Make it hard,  
Oh takin' roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.

I get out of my own way, let you have your way.  
Cause I realize I'm no god on my own,  
I'm there for you, I'll sell for you  
I can't live without you.

I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Yesterday has come and gone  
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is  
And I see that I was wrong  
For ever doubting I could win  
  
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same  
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Life's too short to have regrets  
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget  
Only have one life to live  
So you better make the best of it  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins

Rebecca Lynn became my heart's desire  
Long about the start of second grade  
Mrs. Roosenbloom let me sit beside her  
So we'd pass notes and after school we'd play

Singing ring around the rosie  
Pocket full of dreams and posies  
Patty cake and baker's man  
Tag your it, kick the can  
  
And I think I hear my mama calling  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
High school days with me and Becky learning what it really means to be in love  
Give and take, holding back for Heaven's sake  
And fighting for a week and making up  
I said please Becky won't you marry me  
Prom night in my car out by the curb  
She was so surprised, first she laughed and then she cried  
And somewhere in my heart I'm sure I heard

Mama flashed the porch light for me  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
When love is wrong it dies and that's the way it goes  
But when it's right, your love grows

Now that's a common little miracle I know.

The summer she turned sweet sixteen  
He finally found his nerve  
And took her out to see  
And what she saw through her tears  
Were seven hearts for seven years  
  
CHORUS:  
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watch their feelings grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
The tenth time he carved their names  
Caroline's dad was giving her away  
There beneath the shelter of  
The tree of hearts they pledged their love  
  
And then four hearts down the road  
They brought the first of two born home

And they played beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watched their children grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart

And where to throw my cape  
I call my co-stars brother  
I call my co-stars name  
I play both good and evil parts  
I sing to Verdi's grave  
  
And every single morning  
By 10 a.m I'm dressed  
My rehearsals last for hours and hours  
With diligence I have been blessed  
Some people, they call me monster  
Some people, they call me saint  
My talent feeds my darker side  
Yet no-one will complain  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
I've sung for Kings in Europe  
And Emperors in Japan  
  
And after each performance  
People stand around and wait  
Just to tell me that they loved my voice  
Just to tell me that I'm great  
I am an opera singer  
I will sing when you're all dead  
I sing the mountains crumbling apart  
I sing what can't be said  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
Most people seem to know my name  
Or at least know who I am

You've got your grand piano.  
And you don't even play piano.  
  
I'm the one who plays piano.  
You don't even play piano,  
But you part the waters.

I stay inside  
I wonder why  
  
And the cement mixer gets it all ready  
One good turn at a time  
Then pouring it slowly and steady  
You're showing me where I can sign  
What I can expect to find  
But how you can you say you'll be happy

We lived in a cabin, I fished along side of him  
I fell under the spell of his sorcery  
  
When he cast me adrift at the end of the summer  
It was not for another but his own privacy  
I fell apart like a rose, but the scent of my longing  
Remains and it weeps like an old willow tree  
  
At night when it's still, with a yellow moon rising  
When his candle is snuffed and he's deep in a dream  
I move like a cat, and crawl into his window  
And lie down beside him in a golden moonbeam  
  
The smell of his skin is just like the summer  
When our love was as fresh as the grass in the fields  
And ever so softly I kiss his eyelids  
Before slipping away, my secret concealed  
  
Though I'm in it alone, I'm still in it, In love

As long as you'll join me in that emotion  
Half of lovin' is no fun  
Give it all, give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Don't leave me guessing alone  
Don't walk me half the way home  
You can do that tomorrow  
Just give me give me all night.

Carly Simon,Grownup,/c/carly+simon/grownup_20027320.html,"I stood in the doorway in my white nightgown  
Red roses on cotton, I stood three feet from the ground  
the grownups inside used words I didn't know  
But still I enjoyed the show  
  
They looked so lovely, they looked so self-assured  
And I just like them would know it all when I matured  
And I wouldn't be afraid of the darkness or the bears  
Or the cracks in the ceiling upstairs  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones, they call me a grownup  
  
Lat night at a friend's house a little girl was there  
She stood in the doorway playing with her hair  
She looked up to me as if I could do no wrong  
As I got up to sing my song  
  
I sang it with a shiver in my throat and in my knees  
Feeling just as small as a thistle in a breeze  
But the child's imagination carried me along  
And saw me through my song  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones call me a grownup

Carly Simon,Libby,/c/carly+simon/libby_20027223.html,"If all our flights are grounded  
Libby, we'll meet in Paris  
Dance along the boulevards  
And have no one to embarrass,  
Puttin' on the Ritz in style  
With an Arab and an Heiress,  
Libby we'll fly away - hey  
Leave behind our blues  
Trade them all in  
For a Paris breeze.  
Libby we'll fly  
  
See how dark the circles grow  
In a town that has no light  
So many eyes just staring out  
Into the bloodshot night  
And Libby, I hate you to cry, and I  
Want to share it all with you,  
And if it brings us to our knees  
We'll trade it all in for a Paris breeze.  
Libby we'll fly.  
  
They say it don't come easy  
They say that love is blind  
And if you're afraid to be close  
Then love is hard to find  
And if you spend too much time winning love  
There's no time to be kind  
And Libby, I'm guilty of your crimes,  
I'm just another passenger.  
Travelling on these crazy high seas  
Very likely be the same  
In a Paris breeze,  
Libby we'll fly  
  
If all our flights are grounded,  
Libby, we'll go to Paris  
And wish we were back home again  
Or sailing on the ocean  
Just a window and a drink  
To set our dreams in motion  
But Libby, we'll fly anyway, hey  
And leave behind our blues  
Half sung melodies  
Trade them all in for a Paris breeze,  
Libby we'll fly.

Carly Simon,Life Is Eternal,/c/carly+simon/life+is+eternal_20027306.html,"I've been doing a lot of thinking  
About growing older and moving on  
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on  
For a long, long stay  
But just how long and who knows  
And how and where my spirit will go  
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone  
Or evaporate on a breeze  
Won't you tell me please  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight  
  
Here on earth I'm a lost soul  
Ever trying to find my way back home  
Maybe that's why each new star is born  
Expanding heaven's room  
Eternity in bloom  
And will I see you up in that heaven  
In all it's light will I know you're there  
Will we say the things that we never dared  
If wishing makes it so  
Won't you let me know  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight

And your house is up for sale  
We divided your railway watches  
Between the four of us  
I fought over the pearls  
With the other girls  
But it was all a metaphor  
For what was wrong with us  
As the room is emptying out  
Your face so young comes into view  
And on the back porch is a well-worn step  
And a pool of light you can walk into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
Can you clear up the mystery of the Sphinx?  
Do you know any more about God?  
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin  
On the face of the moon?  
Have you reconciled with Dad?  
Does the rain still make you sad?  
Last night I swear I could feel you  
Moving through my room  
And I thought you touched my feet  
I so wanted it to be true  
In my theater there is a stage  
And a footlight you can step into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
In the river I know I will find the key  
And your voice will rise like the spray  
In the moment of knowing  
The tide will wash away my doubt  
'Cause you're already home  
Making it nice for when I come home  
Like the way I find my bed turned down  
Coming in from a late night out.  
Please keep reminding me  
Of what in my soul I know is true  
  
Come in my boat, there's a seat beside me  
And two or three stars we can gaze into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you forever  
Like a river  
  
I'll never leave, always just a dream away  
A star that's always watching  
Never turn away  
We'll never leave, always just a thought away  
A candle always burning  
Never turn away  
The moon will hide, the tree will bend  
I'm right beside you  
I'll never turn away

Your eyes were pale like the moon  
We'd sit on the porch in Summer  
Listen to the breezes  
Spinning melodies  
I dressed you up like a god

And the woods are full of tigers  
And freedom's for the birds

And you've taken on a wife

Or does it sneak up on you  
That there might be something more

Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me

Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart

Somewhere this life isn't crazy  
But I've traveled the world far and wide  
And I say they're wrong  
  
Don't sell me  
Stories that music's a lady  
It's not when the singer's alone  
At the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]  
At the end of a song  
There's no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And there's nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
It's lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But we've come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song

The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,  
And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.

Let's come of the line, now, at Sunset and Vine  
But I'll go ya one better, if you've got the nerve

We were buggin' each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine  
I flew past La Brea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were: At Deadman's curve  
  
(SPOKEN) Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve

Is how to live without it  
I just can't seem to find it.  
  
So I've made my mind up I must live  
My life alone  
And though it's not the easy way  
I guess I've always known  
I'd say goodbye to love.  
  
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine  
Surely time will lose these bitter memories  
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in  
And to live for something I could live for.  
  
All the years of useless search  
Have finally reached an end  
Loneliness and empty days will be my  
Only friend  
From this day love is forgotten  
I'll go on as best I can.  
  
What lies in the future  
Is a mystery to us all  
No one can predict the wheel of fortune  
As it falls  
There may come a time when I will see that  
I've been wrong  
But for now this is my song.  
  
And it's goodbye to love  
I'll say goodbye to love.

He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon

You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned ten just the other day  
He said ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on lets play  
Can you teach me to throw? "" I said, ""Not today,  
I got a lot to do"" He said ""that's okay""  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
And said ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm going to be like him""

So much like a man I just had to say,  
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head, and he said with a smile  
  
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later, can I have them please? ""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon

But we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said ""Id like to see you if you don't mind""  
He said ""Id love to Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu.  
But It's sure nice talking to you, Dad,  
It's been sure nice talking to you........ ""  
And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me,  
My boy was just like me..............

Not fit for a dog in New York  
  
Everybody bites on the Big Apple  
Leave the hungry in tears  
But no one gives a damn no one really cares  
How they feel they're just paper people not real  
  
You need a gun to walk into New York  
  
Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge  
Who can help you this time  
Now you're down to your very last cent  
Still you're askin' me who was your friend  
I was your friend  
  
New York poor New York  
Who turned the lights out in New York  
  
New York poor New York  
Just another blackout in New York  
  
Girl dead on the 26th floor  
But no one knew her name  
Found her body behind the door  
Too young for the game  
  
New York poor New York  
Devils in the subway New York  
New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
Talkin' talkin' talkin', watch out  
Harlem touching midtown New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Talkin' 'bout New York New York  
Money's getting tighter New York  
They're burning the bridges to New York

Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around  
Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street  
Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played  
Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea  
In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again  
  
Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man  
Came down on day when no-one was looking and it  
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobody...helping no-one else  
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through  
You'd better know what you're going through now  
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon  
  
That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything  
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking  
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance  
From the people you meet.  
  
Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes  
'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again.  
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost  
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost  
I want back, I want back  
Back to the time when the earth was green  
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean  
Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine, no.

As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet

Underneath her her kiss I was so unguarded  
Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy  
  
She was so much younger then, wild like the wind  
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country  
but deep beneath her curls,  
Beneath this misty pearl, there was more to see  
  
She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife  
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted  
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

I want you so to know there's no bridge between us  
All those gates have opened now, and through the light has shone

It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed  
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head.  
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun  
Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on.  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked 'till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.  
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait I was sad but I had to go,  
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget.  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door.  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed,  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.  
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread  
I'll tell you everything I've learned, and Love is all, he said.

You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along

That love was meant for beauty queens  
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles  
Who married young and then retired  
  
The valentines I never knew  
The Friday night charades of youth  
Were spent on one more beautiful  
At seventeen I learned the truth  
  
And those of us with ravaged faces  
Lacking in the social graces  
Desperately remained at home  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""  
And murmured vague obscenities  
It isn't all it seems at seventeen  
  
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs  
Whose name I never could pronounce  
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve  
They only get what they deserve.  
The rich relationed hometown queen  
Marries into what she needs  
With a guarantee of company  
And haven for the elderly""  
  
So remember those who win the game  
Lose the love they sought to gain  
In debentures of quality  
And dubious integrity  
The small town eyes will gape at you  
In dull surprise when payment due  
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen  
  
To those of us who knew the pain  
Of valentines that never came  
And those whose names were never called  
When choosing sides for basketball  
It was long ago and far away  
The world was younger than today  
When dreams were all they gave for free  
To ugly ducking girls like me  
  
We all play the game and when we dare

Repenting other lives unknown

'Tis thou, 'tis thou canst save amid, despair  
  
We slumber safely till the morrow  
Though we've by man outcast reviled  
Oh Maiden, see a maiden's sorrow  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child  
  
Ave Maria  
  
Ave Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Ave ave dominus, dominus tecum  
  
The murky cavern's air so heavy  
Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled  
Oh Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child

A song, a song  
High above the trees  
With a voice  
As big as the sea

In your palace warm

A child  
A child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
Let us bring him

But I didn't get far  
'Cause the radio played  
Every song that I sang with you  
  
Yesterday's gone  
And it may be true  
But you know that  
I'll never get over you  
  
It's just a game of love, love love

Foolin' with your heart girl

They just don't understand

Tell me I should live without him

Judge a book by its cover

Oh and I know his heart is true  
I don't need anyone  
To tell me what to do

'Cause it's understood  
When the love is good  
Nothin' else is gonna do

Play it once I could disappear  
Some rules to the game of me  
Get it right for both of us  
  
Just say what you wanna say

Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me

Open up your heart  
Even if it's hard  
Say that you need me  
Then let him know  
Baby don't put on a show  
  
You say that you need me  
Tell him how you feel  
Let him know it's real

Cats were born to give chicks fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever 'til you sizzle

Let me show you  
How much I need you

I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you

Upper hand, but now I know that I'm  
Really not that strong  
If I could only make you understand  
I'd give you the world  
But for a start  
  
Baby just have a heart

I need my love to be here...  
  
Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of his hand  
Nobody can  
Deny that there's somethin' there  
  
There, running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love him is to need him everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
I'll be there

Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there

For all that I can give  
The spark that makes the power grow  
  
And I will stand for my dream if I can  
Symbol of my faith in who I am  
But you are my only  
And I must follow on the road, that lies ahead  
And I won't let my heart control my head  
But you are my only  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
And I know what I've got to be  
  
Immortality  
I make my journey through eternity  
I keep the memory of you and me  
Inside  
  
Fulfill your destiny  
Is there within the child  
My storm will never end  
My fate is on the wind  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild  
We don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
I'll make them all remember me  
  
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true  
Every ounce of me must see it through  
But you are my only  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way  
I will make them give to me  
  
Immortality  
There is a vision and a fire in me  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
  
With all my love for you  
And what else we may do  
We don't say, goodbye

Eye to eye, so close, so far away  
  
That distant look is all you've got to say  
Everytime I try to talk to you  
Every word is lost in space  
Drifting further apart in every way  
We've come to be the ones that love is out of sight  
It's so clear that we just don't see  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

To go on and on, when the feeling?s gone  
I can say now, that it's to late  
To try and change your mind

Just one touch - I'm mesmerized  
I just can't help myself

So many tomorrows we have left behind  
The future becomes harsh

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse  
That never left the post  
I lay in my room  
Starring up at the ceiling  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower  
And to them my life  
To drink a toast I walk in the park  
Just to kill those lonely hours

All afternoon  
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune  
This is love this is it

And I decide that love is a bore  
Love seem sure around the new year  
Now it's April

I'm holding the last  
We had our day  
Now that's all in the past  
Spring came along  
A season of song  
For love's sweet promise  
But something went wrong  
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic  
Sulfur and molasses was the dose  
Didn't help me a bit  
My condition must be chronic  
Spring can really hang you up the most

Winter was a gracious host  
But when you keep praying  
For snow to hide the clover  
Spring can really hang you up the most

Tough times were around me but better times ahead

A friend who taught me right from wrong  
And weak from strong

What, what can I give you in return?  
  
If you wanted the moon  
I would try to make a start  
But i, would rather let me give my heart

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah  
But in my mind  
I know that they live on and on and on and on  
But how do you thank someone  
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?  
Well it's not easy  
But I'll try  
  
If you wanted the sky  
I would write across the sky in letters  
That would soar a thousand feet high  
To you, with love  
Those awkward years have hurried by  
Why did they fly, fly away  
Why is it sir children, grow up to be people one day?  
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside?  
What, what is there that I can buy?  
  
If you wanted the world  
I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrawl  
These words withe letters ten feet tall  
To you, with love

How I missed my peace of mind

Still the smell of you was on my face  
But you were too busy  
To notice me last night

I can't make it alone  
I can't take it  
I can't make it alone  
Oh no, ooh, oh no  
  
Then I tell myself I'll put you down  
Don't want to see your face around  
Don't call me up anymore  
When I hear your voice it's in my ear  
You're kissing on the phone  
It makes it all come clear

I try to tell myself  
Don't need you anymore  
Don't want you hanging around my door, oh no

I can't take it, I can't make it alone

Just took her youth and happiness  
As with the boy she vanished in  
The secret sweetness of their sin

So they roamed from place to place  
Although she realized she'd sinned  
She grew caution to the wind  
As she followed him around  
While he slowly dragged her down  
  
So overpowering was her love  
The it had made a captive of  
The young girl's heart and soul and mind  
In other words: love drove her blind

Had she been wise and she'd have known  
She could feed him love alone

When he would quit her just for crumbs  
He needed fresh young meat to love  
And left her heart and mind to starve

To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces

While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of ""Ruby's Place""  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression

How I feel when you're near  
How I feel by your side  
How I'm glad I'm alive

Doesn't mean anything  
How my home's anywhere  
Knowing that I know you care  
And how nothing I see  
Beyond you and me

Was to give and give

I followed him around in traveling shows  
Along the main county lines  
Watching him drinking his mind away  
Not ever knowing my name at time  
Each night when the show closed down  
He used to tell me of his dreams  
He was wearing new French suits  
While I mended my torn jeans

Then one night in Santa Fe  
The horses stop going around  
There he was my poor rich man  
Lying on the Mexico ground  
All the sad music of his life  
Is still spinning in my mind  
The carousel starts up again  
And I found my place in life

Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you

Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore

Exactly what we choose just not to believe

Got a ticket to my destination.  
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.  
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.  
Homeward bound,

Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.  
  
Ev'ry day's an endless stream  
Of cigarettes and magazines.  
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories  
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting

I'll play the game and pretend.  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

There's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come

And gonna fill my guts with poison

Walk on guilded splinters

Drink poison in my chalice

And you all feel my malice  
I put gris-gris on your doorstep  
So soon you be in the gutter  
I'll make your heart melt like butter

WRITER SONNY BONO  
  
  
Monday knows what it's all about  
She's the kind of girl that can do without  
She was mature at sixteen years  
She grew up fast she was raised on tears  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
Her ma was wind and her pa was rain  
She made her home in an empty train  
Her clothes were patched  
And shoes were worn  
She played with the sun  
And fought with the storm  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She bought a book and learned to read  
So no one could learnt what she heard  
She even ate a hershey bar  
To make her kisses sweeter  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She wonder by night  
When the sun was disarray  
Cause every one notice her in the day  
She wrote in her book  
That a flower is good  
But why is a weed so misunderstood  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She learned how to sing  
And she learned how to pray  
She learned it all in one short day  
But she never learned black from white  
She never even learn how to fight  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do

I dropped by to pick up a reason  
For the thought that I caught that my head  
Was the event of the season  
Why in crowds  
Just a trace of my face  
Could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change  
But a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on the ground  
When the messenger  
Wrote me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan  
Who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world  
Could have easily known me much better  
She said  
You're strange, but don't change  
And I let her  
In a while when the smile on my face  
Turned to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who gets sick  
Does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face  
Is moving much faster  
  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know  
Why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
I don't know, why don't you ask her

Chicago,Come In From The Night,/c/chicago/come+in+from+the+night_20029977.html,"How many times have I seen you running  
Just one step ahead of the past?  
So many nights have I seen it coming  
I try to talk to you when you pass  
  
I don't know who you were before I met you  
You keep your secret safe with a mask  
It's almost as though the truth is out to get you  
You're just a runaway from the past  
  
Girl, we've got a love worth keeping  
Maybe there's a way to let it go  
Someday when your demons are sleeping  
Let me know, let me know  
  
Come out of the darkness, baby  
Come in from the night  
You can let the light  
Wash it from your mind  
Open the blinds  
  
So many times have I seen you crying  
Never knowing what it's about  
I do my best, I just keep on trying  
To find a way inside to let it out  
  
Girl, we've got a love worth making  
It would be a shame to close the show  
Now you got a chance worth taking  
Let me know, let me know  
  
Come out of the darkness, baby  
Come in from the night  
You can let the light  
Wash it from your mind  
  
Come out of the darkness, baby  
Come in from the night  
Open up your life, leave the past behind  
Open up the blinds

Chicago,Cry For The Lost,/c/chicago/cry+for+the+lost_20030054.html,"Something I forgot that I used to know  
Keeps on coming back around.  
Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn  
Like a light from down the hall.  
Suddenly some old familiar music  
Songs I know I've never heard before.  
I gotta play along I can't refuse it  
I hear the call.  
  
We've all been so proud of our blindness  
No kindness to share  
  
[Chorus]  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say  
To bring us together.  
  
We can make it better  
We can make it right.  
  
We hide behind the veil of our own success,  
While we're following the rules.  
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands  
To the never changing truth.  
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,  
Justice needs to try her other arm.  
Some of us could push a little harder  
To sound the alarm.  
And I see children marching  
And I hear the drums again  
  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say.  
If we hope and pray,  
It will come, give it half a chance.  
Everyone, understand  
In our hearts and our mind,  
You know there's nothing left to hide,  
We're already there.  
  
I used to cry.  
Cry for the lost I was walking away.  
I used to try to find a reason.  
Then I looked inside,  
I used to mind every time I was walking away,  
I gotta find what I'm feeling  
To bring us together.

As the highway driver braces  
For a race with time  
To reach a destination  
Of his own imagination  
  
A child of the sky  
A rider on the wind  
I can fly  
A prisoner of time  
A dimensional crime  
Lost am I  
  
Winter stars above me  
With a woman who can love me  
And moonlight swept embraces  
Fill my space with joy and peace  
The sweet vibrations  
Of a lover's celebration

my sister and I had an act that couldn't flop,  
my sister and I were headed straight for the top,  
my sister and earned a 'thou' a week at least, oh yea  
but my sister is now unfortunately deceased,  
I know its sad of course  
But a fact is still a fact  
and now all that remains is the remains,  
of a perfect... Double... Act  
  
Watch this!  
Now you have to imagine it with two people,  
its swell with two people,  
  
First I'd,  
Then she'd  
then we'd  
but I can't do it alone  
then she'd  
then I'd  
then we'd  
but I can't do it alone  
  
She'd say what's your sister like  
I'd say men,  
she'd say you're the cats meow  
then we'd wow the crowd again  
  
When she'd go  
I'd go  
we'd go  
  
Then those ding dong daddies started to roar  
whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor,  
yelling, screaming, begging for more,  
and we'd say  
Ok fellas, keep your socks on,  
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

But I simply cannot do it alone  
  
So what'd ya think huh?  
Come on you can say

I know you're right the first part is shit.  
But the second part, the second part is really nifty,

She'd go  
I'd go  
we'd  
  
Then those two-bit johnny's did it around  
to cheer the best attraction in town  
they nearly tore the balcony down,  
and we'd say: ok boys we're going home,  
but before we go here's a few more partin' shots,  
and this, this we did in perfect unison

Now you see me going through it  
you make think there's nothing to it

And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know oh  
One day you'll find that I have gone  
But tomorrow might rain so I'll follow the sun  
All the time you couldn't tell me that one day I'd be glad  
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted

Miles of sky and empty space  
Mirrors my soul  
I'm out here on my own  
  
I got a new job and a couple new friends  
There's even someone special,  
I think I could start again  
But every time we touch  
It reminds me of us, and  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time I close my eyes  
To go to sleep at night  
I wake up and I see your face  
Even in my dreams  
I can't get anyplace  
I can't shake off your lovin' chains  
Your lovin' chains  
  
So I moved back east just to face my tears  
To say what needs sayin' before you disappear  
But old friends say you're gone  
Long since moved on, now

I think I'm never gonna climb this mountain  
Of my feelings for you  
I'm gonna have to live here in your shadow  
Until the skies are no longer blue!

With the dark eyes burning,  
I am opening the wall.  
Can there be no other chance?  
I feel my fortune's turning,  
And I wish for nothing else at all.  
Looking up I see her signal with her fingers through her hair  
Telling me the hands are clean.  
On the

From where the lanterns light the parlors on the street  
Better not wage another her  
And though there are not many things a pawn would  
I'll beat.  
We enjoyed the difference.

Never thought of what I might need, need, need  
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
Feels like I'm four years old all over again  
Because I'm just running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making  
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love  
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
It feels like I'm four years old all over again  
'Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
I'm so alone, I feel so alone, so alone in this world  
Got everything I want

Tony told us this world was ours  
And the Bible told us every girl was sour  
  
Don't play in her garden, and don't smell her flower

Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,  
So you can hear my message, my confession,  
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched
him, like he touched me, like he touched you,  
So carry on his legacy, something I must do, so I trust you lighting candles,
concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room,  
First thing I did when I heard was call puff,  
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,  
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take
us to the ledge.

My niggas are smoking on that loud  
Bitch try to flunt, Imma blow your back out

Fucking with these ratchets no purses they got baskets  
Its a hand out, bitches(...)guess they addicts  
And I ask them are you in like Patrick  
Playing with the pussy like it's madden  
Fire like a dragon

Been leadin as hoes, but they pretty like a pageant  
She said she'd let me cut, I had to stab it, for real though

Never cop bottles, with broke niggas  
In the corner, post it up(or pour shit up), what the dome give her  
Money flowin like a wet pussy, that's a long river  
So you got your bitch on lock, I'll slim jim her  
It's that time of the month fuck timber  
All my niggas got a bottle with a blunt lit up  
Before you pop up, throw your set up  
(hop in this bitch, lights lit up?), leave with her, a big spender, (bitch

(...)Illuminati all through your body  
She blow me like a twelve gang shawty you feel me  
Pull up in the 'rari, the fuckin life of the party

You're famous girl for breaking hearts  
  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
You're famous girl, girl, girl

Keri would've said my love knocks her down  
Keisha would've told me I was sent from heaven  
Sorry B, I don't wear no ""Halo""  
You were first to play the game, though  
Sorry I bust the windows out your car  
I might of cheated in the beginning  
I was wrong for writing ""Disturbia""  
But I meant it in ""Forever"",  
We were supposed to be together  
And I can't let you go  
  
Said you thought you find the right man  
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me  
Like, damn I let you down, down, down  
Yes I'm famous girl for breaking hearts  
  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart

I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart  
(that I would break your heart)  
  
Many hearts we shoulda left unbroken  
Empty words are better left unspoken  
Too much pressure, I wished I was frozen  
See, we lost our way now  
I hope you're happy being famous, girl  
  
You're famous girl, girl, girl

They wanna keep us away from one another  
But Maybe they're right for a change

The endless roads between the distant lights  
Do you still find yourself  
On strange and long highways  
Drifting into unknown phase  
  
Do you still dream of summer days  
The sunlight dancing on white rolling waves  
The everlasting taste of innocent desire  
The atom splitting of its fire  
  
Do you still dream?  
  
Do you see that tunnel showing any sign of light  
Does fear still wake you in the night  
  
Do you still dream?

Better looking up than looking down  
Don't try to beat it, twist and defeat it  
Leave those kind of complications never to be found

Oh how we wish somehow

Misunderstood like the  
thorn of a rose  
Before the summer came,  
Your beauty washed away  
Like pretty petals in the wind and rain

And it's all for you  
The streets of this town  
Speak only one name  
And that name is you  
  
So when the time comes around  
I want you to know  
You can count on me  
When it all comes down  
You'll know where I'll be  
Standing right next to you

Pastel shades and a candy stripe parallel  
Good time love, oh that I'd been much older  
Go messing with the boys from the in crowd  
But all I could do was wish them farewell  
  
What's that strange music  
What's that fully rhythm  
They call it Blue Beat, but you can call it young love  
You can call it tamla dream  
Down at your local Motown machine  
I need to be loved  
Down at your Twisted Wheel  
  
And I can see that little stage  
All the hands up in the air  
Bombers and blues gonna see us through  
Got my new lime suit mohair  
With a single vent sixteen inch  
Got my two-stroke wheels outside  
We only need the High Numbers now  
And anything on stateside  
Down at your Twisted Wheel

Christina Aguilera,Fell For The Enemy,/c/christina+aguilera/fell+for+the+enemy_20877038.html,"It started as a game  
The bet was on my heart  
But when I looked away  
You caught me off guard  
The tricks were hard to catch  
But now I see right through  
No more hurting me  
No more loving you  
Just wasted all my time  
Empty promises and lies  
Now my fantasy has died  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
I fell for the enemy  
  
A fantastic debut  
Taking part in your masquerade  
I starred as a fool  
And while the music played  
I gave my heart to you  
Boy, how was I confused  
I was only being used  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
I fell for the enemy  
  
I ate the apple off of your tree  
I can feel the poison running through me  
I keep getting stronger  
Boy, you wish that I was weak  
But now you're never gonna break me  
'Cause I know you're the enemy  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me

All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be  
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing  
Listen, all I want to do right now is have your contact on me

Can you put your hands my waistline  
Want your skin up against mine  
Move my hips to the baseline  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
Hang a please don't disturb sign  
Put my back into a slow grind  
Sending chills up and down my spine  
Let me get mine, you get yours

Understand that you can't question me  
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault  
It can't help your jealousy  
If you can handle the fact that  
What we have has got to be commitment free  
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'  
Underneath the sheets

So, come on and freak my body  
We can get nasty, naughty  
All night a private party

Work me like a 9 to 5  
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'  
Cause this is a physical lovin'  
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'  
Gotta hit that spot just right  
Work me like a 9 to 5  
  
We have a physical thing  
We'll make love, but don't fall in love  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
You spend time  
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine  
No strings attached  
I want your body, not your heart

How to grow up living in a war that she called home  
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm

Every time my father's fist would put her in her place  
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room  
Hoping it would be over soon

Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""  
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done  
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss  
  
Mama used to warn me  
To beware of those Latin lovers  
She said I gave my heart too soon  
And that's how I became your mother  
I said hey mama, you seem to forget  
I'm not in love yet  
Sweet talk don't win me over  
But I realized  
Big brown eyes can hypnotize  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
Hey  
  
Skin the color of cinnamon  
His eyes light up and I melt within  
Feels so good it must be a sin  
I can't stop what I started  
I'm giving in  
He brings life to my fantasies  
Sparks a passion inside of me  
Finds the words when I can not speak  
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me  
  
Mama used to warn me  
Not to rush love with another  
She said I'm not trying to lecture  
I just care about my daughter  
Ay mama, you seem to forget  
I never will let  
A man control my emotions  
But when he smiles (when he smiles)  
I feel like a little child  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
  
Caught between my mama's words  
And what I feel inside  
I'm wanting to explore his world  
But a part of me wants to hide  
Should I risk it, can't resist it  
This has caught me by surprise  
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico  
I can't hold back no more  
Let's go tonight  
Ooh, hey  
  
You adore me, never be lonely, oh  
  
I am full blood boricua (boricua)  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (on his arm)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero (oh, quiero)  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
  
I can't help, what I'm feeling  
Infatuated  
Oh oh, oh  
Infatuation  
Hey

It is now time  
The one and only  
There never will be another  
Christina Aguilera  
That's how music should sound  
  
Oh yeah  
I've waited for some time  
To get inside the minds  
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside  
It's like an endless ride  
Feeling the lows and highs  
Of every lyric and melody  
Every single rhyme  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength  
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith  
In his good faith  
  
I'm going back to basics  
To where it all began  
I'm ready now to face it  
I wanna understand  
What made the soul singers  
And the blues figures  
That inspired a higher generation  
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers  
They gave so much of themselves and dedication  
  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
  
Oh yeah  
Hey ha

Man made electric light to take us out of the dark  
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark  
  
This is a man's world, this is a man's world  
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You know that man makes money to buy from other man

Christina Aguilera,My Destiny,/c/christina+aguilera/my+destiny_20514688.html,"Song Lyrics  
What if I never knew  
What if I never found you  
I'd never had this feeling  
In my heart  
  
How did this come to be  
I don't know how you found me  
But from the moment I saw you  
Deep inside my heart  
I knew  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
I wanted someone like you  
Someone that I could hold onto  
And give my love  
Until the end of time  
  
But forever was just a word  
Something I'd only heard about  
But now you're always there for me  
When you say forever  
I'll believe  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
Maybe all we need  
Is just a little faith.  
Cause baby, I believe  
That love will find a way.  
Hey..  
  
Oh baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
From now till eternity  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny

Conceal thy good intent  
  
Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere  
  
And slightly dopey gent

Sweet comic valentine  
  
You make me smile with my heart  
  
Your looks are laughable  
  
Unphotographable  
  
Yet you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than greek  
  
Is your mouth a little weak  
  
When you open it to speak  
  
Are you smart?  
  
But don't change a hair for me  
  
Not if you care for me  
  
Stay little valentine stay  
  
Each day is valentine's day!

Feeling so so lonely  
Wishing someone hold me  
All I have is three little notes playing in my head  
  
Outside I can cover all the scars  
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard  
'Cause all I have are three million melodies to kill all the hurt  
Now I'm ready gonna sing 'em all out  
Sing 'em out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning, Imma sing all night  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
There's no place to hide  
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free  
I'm singing 'cause, I'm winning Imma sing for me  
  
I stand and believe in who I am  
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up  
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free  
My stage is the greatest in the world  
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true  
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny  
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out  
Sing it out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out

You know the way to make me crazy  
I want to give it to you  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional

You take me high and low you know  
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go  
You're such a mystery to me  
  
But baby hot or cold, you got a hold  
Of my imagination  
I think you know what i mean  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional

Sometimes north or south of love

Tell me you can hold on

Can you lift your head high,  
And stay strong  
Will you give up, give in,  
When your hearts crying out,  
That it's wrong  
Will you love you for you  
At the end of it all  
  
In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin' that  
The one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone  
Find a path that is your own  
Love will open every door  
Its in your hands  
The world is your  
Don't hold back and always know  
All the answers will unfold  
What are you waiting for  
Spread your wings and soar  
  
The boy who wonders  
Is he good enough for them  
Keeps tryin' to please em' all  
But he just never seems to fit in  
Then there's the girl who thinks  
She'll never be good enough for him  
Keeps tryin' to change  
And that's a game she'll never win  
  
Now In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low

Is where she come face to face  
With her fears  
Her reflection-so foreign to her  
After all these years  
All of her life she has tried to be something  
Besides herself  
Now time has passed  
And she's ended up someone else with regret  
  
What is it in us that makes us feel the need  
To keep pretending  
Gotta let ourselves be

For a feather falling quickly  
  
And I wrote your story  
But I'm afraid of how it ends  
And though my friends are doing well  
And I'm still on the mend  
  
I'm going to lay back down  
Hope the wind takes me around  
I gotta find some courage in this town  
'Cause nobody's going to save  
Somebody who won't change  
I tried to be brave  
  
Nothing's coming easy  
And all at once  
I feel a little queasy  
Oh but if you lost my remedy  
Won't you please come and be with me  
It's not like there's much better  
But his grasp is as green as mine  
I can't say that I'm satisfied  
Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye

I gotta find some courage in this town  
And everybody's afraid

Christmas Songs,Christmas Dinner,/c/christmas+songs/christmas+dinner_20674346.html,"(Paul Stookey, 1963)  
  
And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
Outside standing, lonely boy-child  
Cold and shivering in the night  
  
On the street, every window  
Save but one, was gleaming bright  
And to this window walked the boy-child  
Peeking in saw, candle light  
  
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys  
Ducks and geese, cherry pies  
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady  
Table bare and tears in her eyes  
  
Into his coat reached the boy-child  
Knowing well there was little there  
He took from his pocket,  
His own Christmas dinner  
A bit of cheese, some bread to share  
  
His outstretched hands  
Held the food and they trembled  
As the door, it opened wide  
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner  
Gently said she, Come inside  
  
The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table  
Glasses two and her last drop of wine  
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas  
And especially, yours and mine  
  
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
That in that town, the happiest Christmas  
Was shared by candle light

Christmas Songs,First Christmas,/c/christmas+songs/first+christmas_20674664.html,"This day a year ago, he was rolling in the snow  
With a younger brother in his father's yard  
Christmas break, a time for touching home,  
The heart of all he'd known  
And leaving was so hard  
  
Three thousand miles away,  
Now he's working Christmas Day  
Making double time for the minding of the store  
Well he always said, he'd make it on his own  
He's spending Christmas Eve alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
She's standing by the train station,  
Pan-handling for change  
Four more dollars buys a decent meal and a room  
Looks like the Sally Ann place after all,  
In a crowded sleeping hall  
That echoes like a tomb  
  
But it's warm and clean and free,  
And there are worse places to be  
At least it means no beating from her Dad  
And if she cries because it's Christmas Day  
She hopes that it won't show  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the apartment stands a tree,  
And it looks so small and bare  
Not like it was meant to be,  
Golden angel on the top  
It's not that same old silver star,  
You wanted for your own  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the morning, they get prayers,  
Then it's crafts and tea downstairs  
Then another meal back in his little room  
Hoping maybe that ""the boys""  
Will think to phone before the day is gone  
Well, it's best they do it soon  
  
When the ""old girl"" passed away,  
He fell apart more every day  
Each had always kept the other pretty well  
But the kids all said the nursing home was best  
Cause he couldn't live alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the common room they've got the biggest tree  
And it's huge and cold and lifeless  
Not like it ought to be,  
And the lit-up flashing Santa Claus on top  
It's not that same old silver star,  
You once made for your own  
First Christmas away from home

Where the water lilies grow.  
On the jukebox Johnny sang,  
About a thing called love.  
And it's ""how are you kid? What's your name?  
And what do you know?""  
  
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky  
I lay down on the ground.  
The arms and legs of other men  
Were scattered all around.  
Some prayed and cursed, then cursed and prayed  
And then they prayed some more.  
And the only thing that I could see,  
Was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me.  
When we got back, labeled parts one to three,  
There was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me.  
  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
A rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,

I looked at him he looked at me,  
All I could do was hate him.  
While Ray and Philomena sang,  
Of my elusive dream.  
I saw the streams and the rolling hills,  
Where his brown eyes were waiting.  
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes,  
That waited once for me,  
That waited once for me.  
  
So drunk as hell I left the place,  
Sometimes walking, sometimes crawling.  
A hungry sound came through the breeze,  
So I gave the walls a talking.  
And I heard the sounds of long ago,  
From the old canal.  
And the birds were whistling in the trees,  
Where the wind was gently laughing.

Sweets and the bualadh bos  
Fifty wild boys to a room  
Sing lamh, lamh eile, the dish ran away with the spoon  
Black shoes and stockings for those who say don't  
Blue is the colour outside  
God made the world  
The snake tempted Eve and she died  
Wild Christian brothers sharpening their leathers  
Learn it by heart, that's the rule

The priest in confession condemns my obsession  
With thoughts that I do not invite  
I mumble and stutter  
He slams down the shutter  
Goodnight - (Good night to you too, Father)  
Stainless as steel  
Lord, you know how I feel  
Someone shoot me while my soul is clear  
I don't think I'll last  
But my vow to abstain was sincere  
Arch-confraternity men to the fight  
Raise up your banners on high  
Searching for grace  
Securing my place  
When I die

Oh God, he kept a very close eye on me  
Hung round my bed in the darkness, he spied on me  
Caught me in the long grass so often, he died on me....  
Ballrooms of romance in Salthill or Mallow  
I stood like John Wayne by the wall  
Lined up like cattle, we waited to do battle and fall  
You can't wine and dine her in an old Morris Minor  
So ask her before it's too late  
I danced on girls' toes - accepted rejection as my fate  
Drink was my saviour, it made me much braver  
But I couldn't hold it too well  
I slipped on the coach and ruined my approach as I fell
