Prince,2045 Radical Man,/p/prince/2045+radical+man_20150065.html,"How can a non-musician discuss the future of music  
From anything other than a consumer point of view?  
These people make decisions for the bulk of us  
Without consulting any of us  
Sales and distributions of our futures  
If this world were fair and right  
They'd give up the car keys this very night  
Damn, hit it  
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Flash forward, 2045  
What did you stand for in the life of your prime  
When faced with the final judgment of today  
Who profited from the game  
That you and your niggas play  
Radical man, save a life  
Come on, take a stand, give that money back  
Let's make a plan, the brand new currency  
Taking care of one another you and me  
Radical, radical  
Flash backward, 1999  
In a world shockful of viruses  
How'd y'all stay alive?  
Depending on this so-called man  
For everything you got comes from his hand  
Food, water, the clothes you wear  
How many of y'all niggas really care?  
We don't care  
Let's define this word, nigga  
Someone who stays high  
Watching their life go by  
Someone content with riding it behind, nigga  
They come in all colors, white, black, Puerto Rican  
But the main niggas we speakin' 'bout  
Wear suits and buy and sell corporations  
With only one thing in mind  
Break it up  
That is the destruction of the  
So-called radical man by 2045  
Let's get radical  
Let's get radical  
Watch me now  
Schooled in the art of digital games  
When the war broke out they called your name  
Everyone of color put on the front line  
Holocaust Avenue, 2009  
Get an education, good job, who says?  
Fool with the gold fronts drinkin' Alize  
They don't play by the rules makin' no sense today  
Gotcha on line so you think it's okay  
Better built cell block, mos def say  
That's where you gonna stay, nigga  
Where you gonna stay, nigga?  
Oh my God, it's the Green Mile  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical man  
What's up, y'all? What y'all wanna do?  
Ain't nobody up in that crew know  
How to really run that computer  
And make it flow  
If you ain't born with it  
You know, talkin' about the to and fro, hit me  
Come on, you know way down  
What George say, fall around, alright  
We claim Miles Davis, not Michaelangelo  
We playin' D-flat in the funk  
You better act like you know  
We don't care what Albert Einstein did  
I'd rather know, rather know  
How they built the pyramid, hey  
James Brown, Chuck D. and Jimi  
Turn me up louder now  
And I don't think y'all hear me  
2045, we will stay alive  
2045, God is on our side  
The whole pop scenario is just nothin'  
But a dream  
The day you wake up is the day  
You get the real cream, nigga  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
This is the funk the industry most fears  
All of us getting together  
In a locked board of directors  
I don't think so  
Ain't nobody runnin' this  
It's all about DNA, the radical man  
Where will you be in 2045?  
30 million people right now  
Are being wiped off the face of the planet  
By a disease they claim has no cure  
In the matter of a blinking eye  
All of us right now can testify  
Take a stand, radical man, oh

Last night I wanted some inspiration  
But I didn't have any dreams  
Coupled with the fact that you belong 2 another  
Whose name is self-righteousness  
So evil girl, if one of us has a date  
With the undertaker, which one will it be?  
You can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy  
This is the best day of my life

And he tries 2 release upon Eve the nectar

Spoke of man in harmony and love abound

Describing the man who willingly died

Less than the tears in your eyes

Prince,5 Women,/p/prince/5+women_20111455.html,"It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again  
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win  
  
March was a cold one in more ways than one  
Went down to the nightclub lookin' for the sun  
Lookin' for a light that could brighten up a day  
That's been darker than a hole since you went away  
  
April usually brings showers  
This time it was a hurtin' kind  
This woman said she wanted my baby  
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind  
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew  
The baby would never really have a father  
Cause I still, 'cause I still, 'cause I still, still, still, huh  
Be stuck on you  
  
It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
Get off my mind, baby  
Fallin' in love all over...you I'll never win  
  
May was her name, she was jumpin'  
Jumpin' from plane to plane  
Actress or model or somethin'  
Can't even remember her first name  
  
June brought an Easter bunny  
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late  
Told a made-up story to a busy-body of our only date  
What a sketch!  
  
July was a heartbreak, extraordinary  
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary  
It felt so much, so much like yours  
But it only made me, made me want you more  
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here  
I want you very...huh, it's you I fear  
  
But it took five women to get you off my mind  
It took five months, five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again  
I fell in love all over with you, I guess I'll never win

It had been so long since I heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no  
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before  
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door  
  
And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you  
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth

I love you so much  
I just can't wait to get my arms around you  
And feel your touch  
If I don't see you real soon baby girl  
I might go insane  
I know it's only been about 3 hours  
But I love it when you call my name  
  
I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war  
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for  
What's the matter with the world today?  
The land of the free? Somebody lied  
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home  
They'll only see you and me making love inside

I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you  
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before  
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws  
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause  
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real  
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you  
I'd have to take you from your man  
I might be tempted to break the law round here  
Because your beauty, it gives one pause  
It slows me down

And a gentle touch  
A different perspective  
That's as bright as a button  
But then you wake up one morning  
And it all counts for nothing  
Cos she's turned into her mother  
  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out like your mother  
I couldn't stand it  
And I'll be damned if  
I'm gonna live with another  
  
It's not the way she looks  
It's not the food she cooks  
Her kind of indignation  
Don't cause me trepidation  
But to live with a woman like this  
Would take a masochist  
Or someone who could get and could stay permanently pissed  
  
(repeat)  
  
You're a grown woman  
Good at what you do  
I'm happy as hell  
When I'm alone with you  
As you stroke my body  
And soothe my brow  
With everything  
That the law will allow  
  
I'm a grown man  
Over 21  
I've got an ugly face  
But I have a lot of fun  
So if spill a glass  
Or break a dish  
Don't get on to me  
Like some haranguing witch  
  
Don't turn out like your mother  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out like your mother  
I couldn't stand it  
And I'll be damned if  
I'm gonna live with another  
  
It's not her looks  
Or the way she cooks  
That wakes me up in a cold sweat  
It's just the knowledge  
That if it happened  
I couldn't drink enough to forget  
  
Don't turn out (etc)  
Don't end up (etc)

And rowed from ship to shore.

Our poems and letters have turned to deceptions

Which reminds me of my duty: I was lost and now I look  
For the turning and the signpost and the road which takes you down  
To that pool inside the forest in whose waters I shall drown

And you lose your resistance  
Slipping down on the darkest side  
You can push too hard  
You can run too fast

Little by little the wheel turns around

Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas, Duke is real  
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers  
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs  
That's cause my dogs ain't there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The more hits we make, more money to burn  
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned  
It don't matter who's hot, who's out  
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, I'm fresh off the plane  
Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain  
M-I-A  
Dom P., palm trees, 9O degrees  
Arm freeze, mom please, ain't nothin' but cheese  
Caribbean Sea, Malibu breeze  
Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens  
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please  
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans  
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me  
Pop bottles, models, be all on me  
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be  
Front on me and see where you all gon' be  
Six feet deep  
When the heat seek, niggas be misty  
From 155th to 11Oth Street  
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
See this is the part I like right here  
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor  
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses  
See man, hold on, I need to break it down  
Yeah  
One time like this  
  
Now would you clap your hands  
Your hands you clap  
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped  
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that  
But you never see me standing on the corner like that  
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted  
Never boosted, never shoplifted  
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'  
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting  
I rock Sean John everyday  
Boutiques from France to the USA  
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent  
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent  
Cause, I'm droppin' hits  
Daily  
You burn me?  
Really?  
Think Bad Boy been played a million times  
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes  
Damn, we still payed!  
  
We still payed!  
Yeah, we got it made!  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'  
We champagne poppin'  
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'  
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'  
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'  
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in  
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in  
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in  
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun  
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him  
Your man got a lot to learn  
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned  
One day you goin' actually learn  
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn  
I stay on my J-O-be  
Nigga, me, P. Diddy, B. are-O-be  
  
[P. Diddy]  
The fam baby, Bad Boy  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
Yeah, I want to dedicate this to everybody that been down with us  
From day one  
Shakin' them asses on the dance floor  
That's all we're tryin' to do  
Mo' money, no mo' problems  
2OO1, Bad Boy forever

Puff Daddy,Best Friend,/p/puff+daddy/best+friend_20112046.html,"[Puffy] (Mario)  
I've seen a lot of things in my life  
Alot of ups and downs  
Made a lot of mistakes  
No matter what, you've always been by my side  
You've always been my best friend  
You're the love of my life (Oh)  
You're everything to me (Oh)  
You never left my side (You're my best friend)  
I love you so much (Yes, you are)  
You're my best friend  
  
[Puffy]  
Since the beginning of time  
All you did was bless men  
Too young to understand but now you my best friend  
How could they doubt you, never think about you  
Don't they know nothing's possible without you  
  
Faith without fear that's how they raised me  
Words of man kill but never phase me  
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me  
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?  
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living  
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in  
Gotta be more than just to lust women  
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen  
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due  
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew  
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through  
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord  
  
1 - [Mario Winans]  
Lord, you mean the world to me  
Before I was born you chose me  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Even catch me when I'm falling  
You're the closest one to me  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole wide world to see  
That we've always been and we'll always be  
Best friends  
  
[Puffy]  
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far  
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star  
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight  
Then give it to you and let it shine bright  
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth  
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit  
Can't you see that He spread love for you  
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you  
Willies with mac millies know how you get down  
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town  
Just remember when you pray, God is love  
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs  
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him  
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him  
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him  
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Puffy]  
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed  
Been two and a half years since my world crashed  
I needed help, God gave me the power  
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour  
Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?""  
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me  
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out  
Never wavered once, gave me no way out  
Your time to die, don't even stress the date  
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take  
I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith""  
""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great""  
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering  
Ground started to shake, everything trembling  
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands  
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on  
  
Repeat 1 While:  
  
[Puffy]  
You mean everything to me  
You've been with me from day one  
Even when I thought nobody was there  
You were there  
You're my best friend  
I love you like no other  
There is no feeling like this in the world  
If you can relate to what I'm feeling  
Put your hands in the air for me  
Let me see you  
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me  
Clap your hands, come on  
Thank you Jesus  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Always catch me when I fall, yeah  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole world to see  
That you've always been, you'll always be  
My best friend  
I love you Jesus  
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses  
As I forgive those who trespass against me  
Thank you

Than to stand here and testify

Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse

The young Don the Heron mover  
You know my hustle I bring the fo' pound to the tussle  
Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle  
So chill 'causeo let me blow for my niggaz  
Runnin round get down like motherfuckin gorillas  
Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop  
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered  
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money  
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny  
Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give  
But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po  
Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa  
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same  
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the cane  
Papi know my face, so he don't expect it  
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it  
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him  
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him  
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept  
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth  
It's the D to the E, M to the O N  
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin  
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap  
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat  
Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine  
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine  
Chorus: Puff Daddy  
I be, that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit  
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit  
That nigga that you can't get along wit  
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit  
That nigga that you see in the videos  
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes  
That nigga that'll die for his main man  
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan  
Verse Two: Jadakiss  
Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?  
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get  
I'm only sizin you niggaz from the waist up  
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup  
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder  
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup  
Nobody badder, since the, baby Finster  
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter  
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips  
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip  
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip  
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb  
Blown the hall pearl wide bill long gone  
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?  
Worldwide while you simply thought where you lived at  
Chorus  
Verse Three: Sheek  
You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car  
Tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are  
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us  
Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish  
Bad Boys, and we all eat together  
When it go down, then we draw heat together  
Since I made the connection with the big man  
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land  
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped  
And what you call weight, I know cats who sniff that  
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?  
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin  
Anything to do with money you can count J in  
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin  
Cream of the crop, and we ain't never gonna stop  
Hittin you in your head with that butter from The Lox

Where I'm tryin' to get to  
Sometimes I hear voices  
I can't see it, can you see it?  
Turn the lights on  
Check this out  
  
Make money's the motto, staying desparados  
New chance of hitting the lotto  
Let's take it to the neck wit this bottle  
Get in the Eldorado  
And break from this bitch at full throttle  
You like fuckin' fashion models?  
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks  
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats  
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles  
And leave a nigga hurting on the block  
Sounding like when you gargle  
Them hero niggas that plot  
Them zero niggas get got  
And never get a chance to bust shot  
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot  
Then I'm on the run wit a gun smoking hot  
All around the world's where I go  
Places that only I know  
Goodfella not gunshotto  
And I'm tellin' niggas, make money's the motto  
Fuck the niggas that squable  
And I hit them back and fourteen hollow, take that

Don't go Don't go

Don't fuck wit my money  
I won't fuck wit your money  
If you fuck with my money  
I make you like one of them presidents  
Feel me?  
  
Representing my money for the love of my money  
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy  
Now don't miss it, if I catch them coming for me  
When I try to tell a dummy  
You took it like I was saying something funny  
Took it like my word wasn't shit, like I wasn't legit'  
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget  
That's something I'll never permit  
When I feel my eye twitch things happen  
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch  
Trying to keep things low-low  
They don't really know, though  
Bad Boy the motherfuckin' logo  
Stay on your toes  
They shouldn't get it mistaken  
Hope they don't think I'm faking  
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken  
You know the rule of thumb be  
Don't try to take nothing from me  
I rule it wit a street stay slummy  
Make money's the motto, fuck the niggas that squabble

Where I'm coming from, where I'm trying to get to  
Shit is really deep, my shit is deep  
  
They don't have a direct understanding of me  
Fuck what they planning for me  
I just won't accept the bullshit that they handing me  
Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me  
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me  
And all that negative shit pertaining to me  
What ya think I claiming to be  
A straight heart staying with me  
I can tell it's about to go down  
I told them, slow down before I send the low down  
And skip out of town  
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta  
The situation is serious and getting hotter  
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger  
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga  
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver  
Like I told them, just to let him know 'til' he figures out  
It's make money's the motto  
Something ya'll should follow  
And I don't got no time for the squabble  
Ya feel me?

Sometimes you just get fed up

Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams  
In the future can't wait to see  
If you'll open up the gates for me

Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't  
If I wanna floss, I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When you rolled up in the Escalade  
Saw that dub you gave to the valet  
Knew that it was game when you looked at me  
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling  
Saw you later in the corner booth  
Raising up a toast so I would notice you  
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know  
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control  
  
2 - All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yeah  
  
Repeat 1  
  
When I took a chance  
Thought you'd understand  
Baby credit cards aren't romance  
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours  
What I need from you is not available in stores  
Seen a side of you that I really feel  
You're doing way too much, never keep it real  
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road  
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?  
I've got to go

Ayo ma' peep this  
My game's tight like the way your jeans fit  
Please believe it  
Yeah you independent I can see  
I'm glad you got your own dough  
You can spend that on me  
And why not, we can stack our dough  
And buy blocks  
If I got you got  
Watch, they hope we might slip  
But we keep a tight grip  
And make hits like this, holla!  
  
[Jennifer Lopez]  
You think the money that you make  
Can substitute the time you take  
To get the keys into my heart  
Think you can win my heart  
Don't know what's in my heart  
I think you need to take some time  
To show me that your love is true  
There's more than dollar signs in you  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

You can't go nowhere ain't got nowhere to turn  
Yeah yeah ain't no way out.  
Ugh check this out  
  
[Verse 1 (Puff)]  
  
Ready to call it quits from all this shit  
Even resign from the niggas I been ballin' with  
I'm second guessing all this negative energy  
It's making me realize why niggas really envy me  
I feel no sympathy it's tight ill  
Plus I get slight chills when I write wills  
Tired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills  
No tellin' what I might feel about my glory  
2 sides to every story  
That's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me  
The more the pain the more the game come with this territory  
I might dispose feelin' like my life been chose  
All I know in my life lotta ice and hoes  
When it's on  
My man there gat in his hand  
What you do when you got a master plan  
But half done ran  
Here's ya chance to prove you love 'em  
It's on and subbin'  
So hot it's feeling muggy. Really though.

I gotta live my life you know. You gave me the ends. No matter  
How bad it gets there ain't no way out no way out.

I shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun  
Man a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1  
Wind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh  
Despite the bullshit black still here  
Makin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's  
Via partaking flicks  
No matter what we have to  
Come strapped with our gats  
We don't want to  
But y'all make us act like that  
It's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you  
La Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do  
Man handle tracks that be laced by Nas  
Rolex watch security straight from the Mosque  
Yo I'm all on my own G who should I trust  
niggas bust B. I. G. Now it seems they want us  
It's like no matter what I do

It takes heart just to live in these streets  
You niggas lift the heat  
Take the bitter with the sweet  
They can't hurt me  
No more than they already did  
They killed Big in my heart he forever lives  
There's no way out  
Like you got Berrettas to my wig  
We were slugged then another blood  
Shed my ribs uhh  
Now the question is Will I survive?  
Nigga gotta make it home I gotta still provide  
And I get the vibe niggas wanna live to try  
Ain't no tellin' what this Bad Boy feel inside  
Blood hate the sweat pain be intensified  
I'm feelin' stranded as if I can't hitch a ride  
Now I tell my seed minimize the genocide  
Plus I'm dangerous so numb I feel painless  
And you know what you  
Tell them niggas who can't touch you  
You grab ya nuts and say muthafuck you!  
You invited got dones be indicted  
And if you kill me  
Me and Big reunited what nigga what nigga what nigga

I need y'all to hear me out there  
Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh  
  
Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin  
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product  
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic  
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic  
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps  
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at  
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet  
Of the almighty, a God to the black child  
I told moms I would be somethin  
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin  
Listen up, I got a story to tell  
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell  
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire  
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire  
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong  
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone  
But nope, I hold my stance in stone  
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin  
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto  
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child  
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip  
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages  
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush  
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push  
Thank God for my life I came through the room  
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel  
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil  
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils  
I foiled your plans and made you aware  
And turned America's dream into a nightmare  
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers  
The first B. I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers  
So ""Who Shot Ya,"" 9 to 5 muh'fuckers  
""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers  
And it's back, better than it ever was  
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was  
So I deliver the truth uncut  
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up  
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""  
For the past ten years, the future is us  
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer  
The preview is over, now enjoy the feature  
Niggaz  
  
I wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long  
Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga  
As we continue on!  
You are now listenin to the sounds  
Of the world famous... You know my name  
You know my name

I look in the clouds, hope you past the sun  
Hope you right next to God and he calling you Son  
Taking you in, Angels breaking you in  
This is heaven and no longer do you have to sin  
And may God bless your mom and your two children  
Your wife, your family and all your friends  
Everybody stay strong, the good die young  
Where we from it's all wrong, we all confused  
Never know what we have til what we have we lose  
Think Big, we just lost a very big jewel  
Hip-hop itself is at a pit-stop itself  
Seeing Big die I wish the shit would stop itself  
It hurts, you're probably too good for this earth  
Genius at his work  
Made dirty cats wanna get a clean shirt  
Pop Cristal and rock they ice work (word), go Big (go Big)  
Everybody wanted to know Big  
Made the rap biz, glitter like showbiz  
Ask anybody, who could flow Big  
All the cats shined, but you would glow Big  
Frank White lyrically, moved niggaz spiritually  
Made you wanna get a cup, fill it up with Hennessee  
Front in the club and light a dutch where the women be  
If you seen the show then I know you felt the energy  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 8X]  
  
Just to let y'all know, everything is all real  
But it's sad when a good fella catch a raw deal  
And pain is a part of life that we all feel  
Today this whole rap game is getting more ill  
It make me look back, to where he took rap  
Dude brought the East back, y'all better believe that  
He never had a warning, One More Chance  
Was right before him everybody must answer when God's callin  
I flew B's wit him, I blew trees wit him  
Couldn't wait to go on tour across seas wit him  
People seem to get lost and, blow things out of proportion  
Life is worth more than the coffin  
I need answers, and they better be the truth  
Hurts like a bad tooth, we losin mad youth  
Lyrically there'll never be no one above you  
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 4X]  
  
Right now I know you missin it, smokin in peace  
After all this bullshit don't cease, huh Big  
Right now, you and Pac in harmony, probably huggin  
While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is buggin  
All these gang wars, Big, show me a sign  
As for your son I'ma raise Shorty like he was mine (no doubt)  
It seems that the devil got his stinkin back whooped  
And we should pray for Jesus, and ask for forgiveness  
I can remember all the studio time, getting twisted  
Bottle after bottle, Bacardi Lime, I miss it  
We clicked like heels when we first met the  
Junior Ma-f-i-a and Big Po-ppa  
Nearly broke down four times writin this verse  
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts  
But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at  
Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at  
But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite  
The only time you see your family is funeral night  
Christopher Wallace, Frank White, holdin it down  
I guess you with the real king in New York now  
For real  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 6X]

Puff Daddy,What You Gonna Do?,/p/puff+daddy/what+you+gonna+do_20112078.html,"It's a Hell Up in Harlem fuckit another day  
Another dollar wake up to the barking from the Rottweilers  
Pull the collars make em sit for the Godfather  
Then I holler to Justin my son run the water  
For the shower trust fund scholarship sure to give him power  
Baby momma call she pick him up in about an hour  
Now free to go free to blow with the calicos  
And the navajos it's just the way this player knows  
Anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam  
Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land  
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?  
He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish  
What is this? Three niggaz dressed in black  
Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat  
One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack  
Put my finger on the trigger  
Then I asked him, ""Whatchu want nigga?""  
Chorus: Puff Daddy  
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go  
Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'  
You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow  
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go  
(repeat 2X)  
Verse Two: Puff Daddy  
I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family  
Wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, ""He ain't make it""  
Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief  
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?  
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street  
All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese  
She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation  
On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh  
That's why niggaz wanna twist my shit, flip my wig  
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills  
Before they draw, niggaz threw me to the floor  
Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket  
They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens  
Love to see a nigga stop breathin  
I heard a voice sing out, ""Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?  
Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads""  
G'night Bone  
Chorus  
Verse Three: Puff Daddy  
Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision  
Watching my life go down, like Christian  
Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis  
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game  
And deuce deuces can't stand the pain  
Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard  
They just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka  
Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers  
Three headed for my chest straight, the other two  
Came a little late, and just barely missed my face  
I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars  
One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars  
Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid  
And own the world, bone all the girlie girls  
That's when I finally figured out  
That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father  
And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions  
No more confessions only suggestions  
I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up  
From the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there  
Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum  
Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them  
Niggaz didn't even get to peep  
Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat  
Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet  
Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead  
They fled, and they waved, hot lead  
If I ain't duck, I'd be on my deathbed  
Sucker move, for that they don't get no props  
Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots  
We in the block, no Land posters just old posters  
Of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures  
I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car  
Took me in the saloon and said, ""Puffy, there you are""  
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots  
Washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches  
I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth  
Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt  
That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin  
That's when I heard the bustin, yeah

Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars  
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar  
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?  
No one important, just another nigga flossing  
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real  
You just a clone wit' a production deal  
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water  
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya  
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth  
Hottest niggas out  
Alot better, the shit's too strong

Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit  
You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret  
Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with  
You can't run, you can't hide  
Bad boy 'till the day we die  
  
Tell they all like jordan in the fall  
On top of the hill like lauren, killing 'em soft'  
What you grillin' me for?  
Kept my name good, we from the same hood  
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood  
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me  
Wanna grind on me  
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me  
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping  
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching  
At all times, put it all on the line  
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares  
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust  
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust  
It get like that though, when you stack that dough  
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close  
So put up you guards, keep faith in god  
I promise y'all the world'll be ours  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Your games amaze, but a lot of ways, many choices  
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices  
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year  
So I listen back cause the street is missing that  
What a world we live in  
So cold I'm shivering, slipping  
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit  
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'  
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'  
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen  
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine  
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm  
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?  
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work  
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt  
In a verse I show the whole earth my work  
It got to get better because it can't get no worse

I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick  
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort  
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court  
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf  
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt  
Me, I always had, so I never go for self  
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt  
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down  
Kick your door down, surround the block

Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round

Copped my cd, now all ya'll wanna be me  
See me on the tv, beds will dip in 3-D  
Peep the cd, chromed out and phoned out  
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out  
I gets it on, money keep growin'  
Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone  
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone  
Like a splinter I enter  
So why should I throw my blows in those  
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles

Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]  
Why did you have to be this way  
Baby all you had to say  
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be  
But you planned a great escape  
Bright and early before I wake  
We both knew we had to break  
You could of chose a better way  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head

You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]  
It was cold the way you left  
Still the pain is in my chest  
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me  
If you put away your pride  
And look deep into my eyes  
It would of been to your surprise  
That I got up to apologize  
But you were gone

Woke up in the morning, you were not there

You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Break: Carl Thomas]  
Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone  
It's time to carry on  
I thought that you made me happy  
But it's this thing that's come between us girl  
At one time you were my world  
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away  
  
[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]  
(Uhh) I dreams filthy  
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey  
Huh, what a set up  
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off  
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off  
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land  
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies  
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up  
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin ""Bastard!""  
Cryin, know my friends is lying  
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers  
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant  
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot  
Giving cats the opposite of diets  
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye  
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me  
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)  
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter  
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like  
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest  
Silencers so you can't hear it  
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me  
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

And the pleaser to my man Plug 3  
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)  
  
Mike G:  
Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push  
And like a champ just knock it on out  
Never ever once sellin' out  
(Oh let loose the juice)  
My buddy helps me to

Keepin' jimmy in total control  
Without Buddy I'd be on a roll

Q-Tip:  
Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times  
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find  
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together  
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)  
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close  
If you be my buddy I will toast  
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille Macgillicuddy  
You can be mines and I can be your buddy  
  
Dove:  
The best buddy's in evening wear  
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)  
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D  
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg  
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed  
  
Afrika:  
Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle  
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you  
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)  
  
Mike G:  
And I watched and then I checked my swatch  
To see the time  
The Soul had formed a buddy line  
And that buddy was (mine all mine)  
  
Pos:  
Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul  
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds  
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands  
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)  
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware  
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh  
Sometimes he cry  
When he think about his girlfriend on his side  
She held him down, she made him better  
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather  
And she thinkin about her life  
With no more work just being a wife  
But instead her love, she gave it to a man  
Who fought against her lovely plans  
So when she go to work, plus go to school  
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool  
She want the ease that come after pain  
She fights for love, thats her campaign

Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out  
I train for the pressure and come out fresher  
Equipped for the game, you know my name  
It makes me better

And then...  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx

You gotta shake a fist at a thousand different fears

I didn't give up then, but I made another plan  
If Satan didn't want my soul I'd sell it to the man  
I tried to find the number, but it wasn't in the book  
I'd get the money anyhow, no matter what it took  
No matter what it took  
  
No paragon of virtue, at least I'm not a thief

I went down on the street and I tried to make the deal  
A Land Rover drove right by with Satan at the wheel

For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year  
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me  
  
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away  
Don't you hear me calling you  
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand  
  
For my life  
Still ahead  
Pity me.

Does it plague you at night?  
Do you feel good feel good?

Queen,Going Back,/q/queen/going+back_20112639.html,"I think I'm going back  
To the things I learnt so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
Now, there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more colouring books  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can't play the game of life to win  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
And, now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
And every day can be  
My magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears  
And live my days instead of counting my years  
Then everyone debates  
The true reality  
I'd rather see the world  
The way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom's all we lack  
So catch me if you can  
I'm going back

Oo hoo oo hoo  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company

My very good friends and me  
We'd play all day with Sally J.  
The girl from number four  
Very soon I begged her won't you  
Keep me company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Come marry me for evermore we'll  
Be good company  
  
Now marriage is an institution sure  
My wife and I our needs and nothing more  
All my friends by a year  
By and by disappeared  
But we're safe enough behind our door  
  
I flourished in my humble trade  
My reputation grew  
The work devoured my waking hours  
But when my time was through  
Reward of all my efforts my own  
Limited company  
  
I hardly noticed Sally as we  
Parted company  
All through the years in the end it appears  
There was never really anyone but me  
  
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe  
But no-one's there to see  
I ponder on the lesson of  
My life's insanity  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company

I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile  
I'd never seen anything that came within miles  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Stuck in the traffic  
Stuck at the lights what do I see  
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me

Rather buy me a new carburetor  
So she made tracks saying this is the end, now  
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now  
  
When I'm holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive  
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive  
  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), gotta feel for my automobile  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), string back gloves in my

Pretending they know what's best for me,  
But I know that I am their experiment,

Queen Latifah,A King And Queen Creation,/q/queen+latifah/a+king+queen+creation_20112732.html,"Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive  
The Queen Latifah the King of 45  
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor  
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a  
A sample sound the she added a compound  
Word this is for those who haven't heard  
A King and Queen combine minds and trample  
Those who oppose us here's an example  
  
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set  
The competition is petty and ready to step  
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one  
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one  
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken  
Queen Latifah's outspoken  
Use your imagination, picture this  
Any male or female rapper trying to diss  
Here for excitement and enticement  
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment  
Teach the youth, feed the needy  
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti  
The mother of civilization will rise  
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation  
Secondary but necessary to reproduce  
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack  
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind  
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher  
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys  
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy  
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King  
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring  
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation  
  
Technician, musical musician  
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction  
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most  
Creativity, you get a double dose  
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test  
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)  
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one  
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one  
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum  
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em  
I rock, never hyperventilate  
Others get tired, could use a commercial break  
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias  
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me  
Just listen, I'm unstoppable  
You want a mission? This one's impossible  
Beats rock all night with no curfew  
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue  
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it  
If the style fits, I wear it  
Many attempts were made, none was recognized  
45 King said sample soundified  
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next  
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet  
Studio mixer, I got the formula  
And said the man from self, I'm warning you  
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur  
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa  
On top, it's a usual act  
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios  
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing  
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing

With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by

Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate

Close your eyes  
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep  
Close your eyes  
And I will close mine  
Close your eyes  
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep  
Close your eyes  
This is divine  
Music play  
Something dreamy for dancing  
While were here romancing  
It's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be near by your side  
So won't you close your eyes...

Queen Latifah,Come So Far (Got So Far To Go),/q/queen+latifah/come+so+far+got+so+far+to+go_20830126.html,"Hey old friend let's look back  
On the crazy clothes we wore  
Ain't it fun to look back  
And to see it's all been done before  
  
All those nights together  
Are a special memory  
And I can't wait for tomorrow  
Just as long as you're dancing next to me  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
What's gone is gone, the past is the past  
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend together  
Side by side and year by year  
The road was filled with twists and turns  
Oh, but that's the road that got us here  
  
Let's move past the bad times  
But before those memories fade  
Let's forgive but not forget  
And learn from the mistakes we made  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So don't give up and don't say when  
And just get back on the road again 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend come along for this ride  
There's plenty of room so jump inside  
The highway's rocky every now and then  
But it's so much better then where I've been  
  
Just keep movin' at your own speed  
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need  
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on  
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone  
We got so far to go  
  
Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So shine that light, take my hand  
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far

Queen Latifah,Dance For Me,/q/queen+latifah/dance+for+me_20112734.html,"It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you  
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?  
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC  
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)  
This MC stands for ""Microphone Commando""  
When I command that you take a hand  
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now  
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)  
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)  
A battle, put me in it, I win it  
The mission is music and rhythm  
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system  
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in  
Heart into the music, music I take part in  
One try, one God, and one destiny  
Just dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 2x)  
Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to  
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""  
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat  
Ample samples, this for example  
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel  
Your plans of moving to the front lines  
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine  
I hop, dip, and spend with the children  
So get down with the sound and you will lend  
To let me bring while I bring  
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating  
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit  
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it  
So if you want to know what the plan is to be  
I order you to dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 2x)  
My voice is your choice at a stage show  
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""  
With powerful lyrics I'm armed  
To let a sucker step up and get bombed  
By a beat created by my producer  
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to  
This here is a moment of truth  
So take the record to the DJ booth  
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb  
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some  
People dancing, I can spot 'em  
When I take control, you know I got 'em  
Stop the music? That's not a question  
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions  
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be  
I order you to dance for me  
""Dance to the music"" (Repeat 6x)

Queen Latifah,Evil That Men Do,/q/queen+latifah/evil+that+men+do_20112735.html,"You asked I came so behold the Queen  
Let's add a little sense to the scene  
I'm living positive not out here knocked up  
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up  
  
This rhyme doesn't require prime time  
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine  
Back again cause I knew you wanted it  
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it  
  
Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled  
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track  
From KRS to be exact  
  
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking  
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking  
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you  
About the evil that men do  
  
Situations, reality, what a concept!  
Nothing ever seems to stay in step  
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers  
Here are some things I want to cover  
  
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?  
Because she's living on welfare  
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan  
So she's in no man's land  
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal  
  
KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!  
  
Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident  
  
[KRS-One]  
But there's no response from the president  
  
Queen Latifah:  
Someone's living the good life, tax-free  
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free  
And that's just part of the message  
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do  
  
Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?  
When someone can put a quarter in a video game  
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street  
You can't treat him the same  
  
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind  
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds  
You to a doom, a fate worse than death  
But there's still time left  
  
Stop putting your conscience on cease  
And bring about some type of peace  
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind  
It will benefit all mankind  
Then there will be one thing that will never stop  
And it's the evil that men do

Someone who is dedicated only to me

So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile

A woman can bear you break you take you  
Now it's time to rhyme can you relate to  
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream  
  
Ayo let me take it from here Queen  
Excuse me but I think I'm about do  
To get into precisely what I am about to do  
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue  
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you  
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed  
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed  
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes  
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)  
  
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)  
  
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see  
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me  
Not for being one but for being with one  
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some  
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on  
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting  
We are the ones that give birth  
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First  
  
I break into a lyrical freestyle  
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles  
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two  
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do  
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)  
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)  
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse  
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""  
  
Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind  
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme  
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse  
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe  
A female rapper with the message to send the  
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen  
  
My sister, can I get some?  
  
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb  
  
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am  
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American  
You dig exactly where I'm coming from  
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some  
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid  
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay  
Pay me every bit of your attention  
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention  
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm  
Of which is now systematically given  
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister  
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another  
Plus one more, all four  
Have a job to do, we doing it  
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it  
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E  
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E  
  
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder  
Cooling on the scene with my European partner  
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax  
When I get there, that's when I tax  
The next man, or the next woman  
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming  
And I'll recite the chapter in verse

Queen Latifah,Latifah's Law,/q/queen+latifah/latifahs+law_20112739.html,"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of  
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of  
Being forced to put suckers in their place  
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face  
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you  
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two  
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me  
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me  
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two  
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?  
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down  
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown  
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par  
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for  
This is Latifah's Law  
BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me  
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me  
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life  
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life  
Fire and desire make you go a little higher  
When I grab the wire of the mic  
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot  
Cause I roll like the homicide squad  
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and  
Left you in the litter to consider coping with  
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen  
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again  
Get a grip on the African way  
Cause there's a sucker born every day  
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw  
And this is Latifah's law  
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you  
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to  
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band  
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed  
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin  
A funky message from beginning to end  
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land  
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland  
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense  
In case you forgot, just check your conscience  
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine  
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine  
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew  
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do  
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call  
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails.  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces  
With distant gay traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales.  
  
Then you came along with your siren of song  
To tempt me to madness!  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness  
Of a great love for me.  
  
Ah yes! I was wrong  
Again,  
I was wrong.  
  
Life is lonely again,  
And only last year everything seemed so sure.  
Now life is awful again,  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.  
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,  
All I care is to smile in spite of it.  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.  
Romance is mush,  
Stifling those who strive.  
I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be, while I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H  
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates  
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise  
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys  
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking  
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking  
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred  
When you address me, address me as ""Your Highness""  
One of hip-hop's finest  
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo  
It makes me no difference  
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me  
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?  
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic  
And draw attractions  
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles  
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them  
The result with a pen and a pad  
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
I can't wait until the party is jam-packed  
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""  
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly  
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be  
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell  
Guard as well as you can or step  
Off the premisis, in one minute it's  
Going to explode in a style that's limitless  
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move  
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool  
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss  
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust  
Literature that flows like liquid  
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it  
So don't say nothing  
Just listen up, follow instructions  
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said  
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads  
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands  
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams  
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery  
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me  
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this  
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness

Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams,  
quiet walks by quiet streams  
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Well then it takes a twist  
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cause he's scared to get dissed  
I don't walk baby  
I don't bite neither  
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper

Yes he was  
Word up, the type you have on a plate  
Cause I only met him last night  
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right  
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo  
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?  
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand  
Now what was in your plan?  
I really didn't understand  
We're only going to the movies  
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony

You can make me smile a little and give me convo  
All I might require from my man is intelligence  
And all them other material things is irrelevant  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen  
And you know how to treat a queen  
Then step to the scene  
We can sit alone in a room and deal  
We can take a ride listening to music and chill  
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do  
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you  
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey  
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are  
Money ain't gone make me love ya  
And even with your car  
So cease with that attitude  
With that attitude you won't be getting far  
  
And I love all of my brothers with a passion  
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction

So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught  
And I agreed because I already knew this  
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect  
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set  
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free  
For God so loved the world he gave to me  
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline  
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness  
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water  
And dive into the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Some MC's have gold and African vein  
And using each other to compete with  
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine  
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it  
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting  
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting  
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking  
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me  
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks  
Dying to have a lover of my likeness  
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""  
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Word of mouth is always everlasting  
And everlasting are the words that I bring  
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey  
And music is made by Mark the 45 King  
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass  
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace  
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs  
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping  
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness

I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste  
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness

From the coast tonight  
Remember making love in the rain?  
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound  
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain  
I'm not much without you, can't leave  
If I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around

And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour  
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew

Hoist the sail and we'll be gone

From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare  
  
Is this all that's left  
Of my life before me  
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs  
No happy ending like they've always promised  
There's got to be something left for me  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies

From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare (Lies behind my stare)

How many more lies will they tell me  
All I want is the same as everyone  
Why am I here, and for how long

Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away

10 P.M., I feel the rain coming down  
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm  
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour  
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine  
  
Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall  
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall  
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin  
(""What are you doing out in the rain?"")  
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks  
(""I've been waiting for you. Come in."")  
  
Mary, Mary just a whore for the underground  
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation  
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you  
You know too much for your own good  
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here  
My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam  
What we need is trust, to keep us both alive  
Help us make it through the night  
  
I've no more want of any faith  
Binds my arm and feed my mind  
The only peace I've ever known  
I'll close my eyes and you shoot  
  
No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength from my lips  
I pray I feed you well  
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long  
For what you gave to everyone  
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed  
From my barrel of death, he turned the Holy water red  
As he died he said thank you  
I just watched him bleed  
  
I feel the flow, the blessed stain  
Sweating hands like fire, and flames  
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right  
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight  
  
Mary, sweet lady of pain  
Always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you, parallel lives  
Winding at light-speed through time  
  
No time to rest yet  
We've got to stop his game  
Before madness has the final laugh  
Too much bloodshed  
We're being used and fed  
Like rats in experiments  
No final outcome here  
Only pain and fear  
It's followed us both all our lives  
There's one thing left to see  
Will it be him or me?  
There's one more candle left to light  
  
Don't turn your back on my disgrace  
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep  
The sins of man are all I taste  
Can't spit the memory from my mind  
I can't cry anymore  
  
Mary, my lady of pain, always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you, parallel lives  
Winding at light-speed through time, you're mine

Did you ever think  
That these things that you did  
Would come back to haunt you  
And fail you again  
Don't ever question  
My will to admit  
That when we're alone  
It's too hard to resist  
Making believe  
That we're bigger than this  
For choosing a road  
That is different but similar  
To the same one I took before  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The simpleness describes  
The iron that is you  
And your rusty old life  
Get on with the mattress  
And tell-tale lies  
Watch everything  
That you touch turns to ice  
Following the sheep  
And they're at it again  
Making believe  
That there're free as it seems  
But only finding out that  
They're on a sinking ship  
That doesn't care  
How many it saves today  
  
Why don't we breathe

That things aren't always

The perfect way to grow old  
  
Watch out now  
I see the light  
At the end of the tunnel  
It seems realistic  
That getting there will make us fine  
But watch out now  
It's full of glass  
Don't take the chance  
You'll surely pass  
At least some day  
We'll know the reason  
Why  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds

And then you'll realize (Then you'll realize)

A life of crimes not easy, sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with, and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder, or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stand's the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows,  
Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,  
Let's get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight, and listen, and I'll tell you what to say.  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Don't ask any question about the money in the closet  
You'll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike, that's the way it's gotta be,  
Even if it's gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
I'm gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
You've got to tell the jury that it really wasn't me  
Just remember what to say when you're on the stand  
I'm sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true

Cut off by the bartender  
We'll drive right through the door  
With a cannon pointed at his head

Flashing reds behind us  
But we won't pull to the side

R. Kelly,Country Girl,/r/r+kelly/country+girl_20607491.html,"She was a country girl from Clebourne, Texas  
In a big city and she like my necklace  
So we started talking while we took a ride  
In a big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side.  
She was a country girl from the class of '96  
A big booty with some big ol' country tits  
A country name with some country attitude  
Say ""yes ma'am"" but at times she's kinda rude.  
A daddy's girl so I had to watch my ass.  
6 three Mr. Hill would whoop my ass.  
We can't kick it I'm a city kid  
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did  
(What we did)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
She likes country livin' and acoustic guitars  
And Kenny Chesney and country bars  
And Cadillac's and I couldn't relate  
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date  
And her dad hated me... oh I knew it.  
He didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears, and black music.  
We still cow-tippin' and trippin'  
With that brush papa shirt lit back cause she was pimpin  
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin'  
Aint used to my style big limos and clubbin'  
A city kid and I'm doin' my thang  
I like an old country girl this is how I sing.

I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
A country girl cut off jeans and lolly pops  
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops  
A country girl with them country ways  
Livin' big city nights  
But them country days  
A country girl don't understand thuggin  
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin  
A country girl pig-tails and care-free  
No direct dish just channel 3  
(Come on, this the only channel you have?)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a differenty world

Looks like that's everything  
She walks by, one last time,  
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind  
There will be more tears  
As she's beginning to drive away  
Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain  
Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here  
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine  
  
But she'll be going elsewhere  
And she'll be lying else where  
And she'll be wanted elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
And she'll be living elsewhere  
And she'll be laughing elsewhere  
And shell be happy elsewhere  
And I'll be just fine without her, someday  
  
That's what I keep telling myself  
  
Was it the right thing  
Was this our biggest mistake  
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say, And still she stays away  
It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her  
How could she, Why would she  
Do these things put me through this pain now  
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad  
That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try  
  
But she'll be trying elsewhere  
And she'll be loving elsewhere  
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
And shell be willing elsewhere  
And shell be giving elsewhere  
And she'll have feelings elsewhere  
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it  
  
But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think  
There's so many things in my head  
Things she said, things that she meant  
Things that I started feeling the day that she left  
Things that I slept on  
Things that I should have accepted  
Things I expected and the things I neglected  
I better get up off my ass  
Get first flight out, and get her back  
  
Or else  
  
She'll be living elsewhere  
And she'll be crying elsewhere  
And shell be feeling elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
She'll be smiling elsewhere  
And she'll be laughing elsewhere  
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere  
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight

We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
  
I'm trying to be...  
I'm trying to be the man,  
I'm trying to be the one you could talk to.  
I'm trying to understand  
After all the arguing, be the best I can!  
But everything... Just wasn't right for you  
So what I gotta do!  
Hey, even made the sacrifice,  
... Just wasn't right,...

We've been going through these changes,

Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey  
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be  
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to kick it on the front porch  
(With you)  
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed  
(With you)  
And all the little basement party joints we'd do  
Now I'm just missing you  
How I wish  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay  
And if I make it out this thug life  
I'll see you again someday  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
  
Now ever since this money come  
It's been nothing but stress  
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success  
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed  
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness  
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton  
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun  
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now  
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house  
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits  
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em  
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around  
But y'all don't want to raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments  
(With you)  
And how I used to club hop on weekends  
(With you)  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolences  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church  
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now  
For me to save the world I don't understand  
How did I become the leader of a billion men?  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to street perform on Friday  
(With you)  
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday  
(With you)  
Standing here throwing them songs at me  
Somebody pray for me  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me

R. Kelly,Language Of Love,/r/r+kelly/language+of+love_20916206.html,"Ft. Taj Jackson  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
  
Your expressions are saying what I wanna hear  
Like baby will you spend the night  
Let's go to the special place you always take me to  
The signal I'm whispering inside your ear  
Got you feeling butterflies  
Cause you're anticipating the things I'ma do to you  
  
She's swinging her hair  
That's sign number one  
Doing the dance for me  
Like I'm that song in the club  
And she's putting her hair  
Where she wants me to start from  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love  
Softly, you're killing me the pillow  
She's finding me funny  
But shaking like it's 30 degrees below  
So I gotta keep her warm  
Like some hot tea  
Keep you up all night  
Like some coffee  
Take you on a ride  
We'll be sitting in the backseat  
On my Bentley  
Take you anywhere you wanna go  
  
She's breathing hard  
That's sign number two  
Doesn't matter where we are  
Long as I'm with you  
But the way you communicate  
When I do what you like  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love

Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear  
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around  
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground  
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show  
When it gets down to it, everybody knows  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground  
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down  
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night  
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light  
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get  
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done

It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm  
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door  
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half  
The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'

That you really care for me

You took me, flew me away, yeah

Then you gave me direction  
And now the rest of my days  
I can't help but give you the praise

You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts  
You brought the sun into my life

And you're the only one  
Who was there when I needed a friend  
You're the only one who can place joy  
When there's pain in my heart

I hate these striplights they're not so undoing as your stare  
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear  
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here  
[chorus]  
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down  
And nail my feet up where my head should be  
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown  
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly  
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm  
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm  
You have this expression dear no words could take its place  
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face  
[chorus]  
I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls  
If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls  
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss  
If you don't know what is wrong with me  
Then you don't know what you've missed  
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight  
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright  
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess  
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""

You'll see devils tearing your life away.  
But... If you've made your peace,  
Then the devils are really angels  
Freeing you from the earth..... From the earth.... From the earth  
  
White worms on the underground  
Caught between stations  
Butterfingers  
I'm losing my patience  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
You got money to burn....  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away.....  
Away, away, away,  
Away, away, away.

Our words are never safe  
Fighting myself  
'Til I'm where I gotta be  
I challenge, don't sweat it  
Now don't you forget it  
Check me? What? Wait  
You better slow down!  
Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat  
I need cash so when I'm cool I'm never ever weak  
Places are fluid and diluted and complete  
Check me once, calm down and take a seat  
Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!  
  
Ugh... Clear the lane [Repeat x 4]

Rippin' up the south set  
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat  
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in

Rage Against The Machine,Darkness,/r/rage+against+the+machine/darkness_20113446.html,"Greed  
Causing innocent blood to flow  
Entire culture lost in the overthrow  
They came to see, take whatever they please  
Then all they gave back was death and disease  
  
People were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
AIDS is killing the entire African nation  
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation  
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.  
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation  
  
My peoples' culture was strong and was pure  
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured  
My people were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system  
  
Their minds did slay  
Their souls they cage  
You feel the rage  
This brutality can never be undone  
But the sun has not yet set  
The bass and drums and microphone a threat  
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside  
And see that they're responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
You turn your culture down my throat  
Say I'm inferior when you vomit and choke  
You fill my mind with a false sense of history  
And then you wonder why I have no identity  
  
We'll strike a match and it'll catch  
And spread the insight we need  
A tiny fire burning bright  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed  
  
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

I wanna introduce a brotha... Who came all the way outta here  
From Long Island, New york. And he's one of the fathers of  
Revolutionary music in our time period. He was a huge influence  
On us and we wanna bring him out right now. So check it out, we  
Got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy. Yeah.  
[Chuck D:] Wassup, wassup! Zack: Yo....  
[x5]  
  
[Chuck D:] ""I got a letter from the government  
The other day  
I opened and read it  
It said they were suckers  
They wanted me for their army or whatever  
Picture me given' a damn - I said never  
Here is a land that never gave a damn  
About a brother like me and myself  
Because they never did  
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...  
It occured to me  
The suckers had authority  
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell  
How long has it been?  
They got me sittin' in the state pen  
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before  
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor  
I'm not a fugitive on the run  
But a brother like me begun - to be another one  
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all  
To criticize me for some crime - never the less  
They could not understand that I'm a Black man  
And I could never be a veteran  
On the strength, the situation's unreal  
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel""

Islam peace, Islam stare into my eyes brother please off our knees  
To beef now we feed their disease, interlocked our hands across seas  
A flag is a rag is a shroud out loud, outside, a faceless crowd

Rainbow,Eyes Of Fire,/r/rainbow/eyes+of+fire_20113634.html,"Hungry and wild she was born to the night  
A demon, a daughter of madness  
One look from her eyes could burn you alive  
Drown you in oceans of sadness  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Face in the mirror we meet eye to eye  
Passions of eternal fire  
Desperately wanting and out of control  
Dancing on winds of desire  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Curtain of darkness, screams of delight  
Taunts me with her sirens calling  
I got to be strong but I can't hang on  
Into the flames I am falling  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide (no, no, no, no)  
From her eyes of fire  
  
She keeps burning  
She keeps burning me, burning me, burning  
Me, burning me down  
Eyes of fire  
Oh no

Someone turned the sun around  
But you can see in your mind

Bonded and sold as a slave  
A sabre dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave

And retches me back out after many years  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts  
  
Amour Amour  
Everyone just wants to tame you  
Amour Amour in the end  
Caught between your teeth  
  
Love is a wild animal  
You fall into it's trap  
It stares into your eyes  
Spellbound when it's gaze hits you  
  
Please please give me poison

do you want him to kneel before you  
do you want him to beg for mercy  
  
Thoughts of vengeance whipped from humility  
you don't see or hear anything  
your sick feelings  
don't give him a chance  
your rage does not want to die  
and only that keeps you alive  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
""My rage does not want to die""  
""My rage does not want to die""  
""my rage will never die""  
  
You ram your hatred like a stone  
into him ""Ramming stone"" -  
you have pursued, hunted, and cursed him  
and he has taken his heels, crawling

Society really brings me down  
Our playground is a pharmacy  
Kids find trouble so easily  
  
Other countries are just as bad  
The soviets really make me mad  
On the boulevard where police hide  
Let's steal a car for a joyride  
  
They say you're just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You love wine like they love cash  
Feel your rage spread like a rash  
  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
They say you're just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone

Gotta go to Idaho  
But we can't go surfing  
Cause it's twenty below.  
  
Sound check's at 5:02.  
Record stores and interviews.  
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow.  
  
Baby  
Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go  
And it may sound funny, but's true.  
Hangin' out in a hundred  
Be watching 'Get Smart' on TV.  
Thinkin' about.  
You and me and you and me.  
  
Hangin' out in L.A.  
And there's nowhere to go.  
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow.  
Listening to Sheena on the radio.  
Oh-ho oh-ho.

You're never happy, a hypochondriac

Too many chocolates keep a fat man fat  
You're a pain in the ass, and your on the (loose)  
All I get from you is your bad attitude  
  
Dirty mouth, it's all I can bear  
Get outta here bitch, 'cause you're nowhere  
Always wearin' that cheap perfume  
Can always tell when you're in the room
