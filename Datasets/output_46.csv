Mist upon the hill can remember murder,  
Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,  
Helped to cover up an approaching army,  
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.  
  
Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,  
Rolled up in their beds were children that play,  
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,  
None of them would see the dawn next day.  
  
Bloody were the blades that fell on children,  
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,  
The mountains only know all the souls that died there,  
Glen coe from that day can recall the shame.  
  
The quiet of the night never gave them warning,  
The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,  
They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,  
Never see the sunrise above glen coe.

You just went, you didn't know the truth  
You don't know that kid when you look back  
You remember the music, paint it black  
  
You had a brother in the movement and he burned his card  
He's got a job in the white house, ain't life hard  
You came back a hero on a stolen horse  
You say you don't fit in, you can't stay the course  
  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
  
The band paraded playing ""Oh gung ho""""  
Your country needs you, you've got to go  
When you came over they said ""Soldier go back""  
When you came home they put you on the rack  
  
Between agent orange and the jungle and fear  
You're just surviving to get out of here  
You smoke some more herb and you keep your head down  
Could be your number is on the next round.

The county's gonna haul my belongings away

My brother said there ain't a thing I can do  
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu  
And I was just thinking about callin' on you  
And I'm busted.  
  
Well I am no thief but a man can go wrong  
When he's busted  
The food that we packed that last summer is gone  
And I'm busted  
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my fam'ly got to pack up and go  
But I'll make a living just where I don't know

Lookin' for a space to die  
Rattlin' like an old tin can  
I'm cruisin' like a laundry van  
Hot 'n' cold fever down to my knees  
Wearin' out all of my rosary beads

He got the remedies I understand  
Gotta find the price to pay  
Gonna send me on my way  
Gotta desperate need, gotta feed the fire  
I got a chemical love and a burned out desire

Can't shake those shakes no more  
Can't shake those shakes, eels like I'm dyin'  
When I'm already dead, I'm dead.  
  
Don't care for sentiment, don't even pay my rent  
Got enough bad habits to blame  
Got enough of them to keep me sane

Foolin and a droolin  
Starts rulin your head  
To seduction, destruction  
Were so easily lead  
  
And then the dawn, the so impatient telephone  
The smell of disappointment  
Mirror wants to pick a bone  
Its a cup of cold coffee  
Like the taste of stale beer  
Lets get outta here

Oh no! Another main line ride  
Oh no! There aint a train in sight  
Oh no! Settin my soul on fire

Carry the flame and make it last  
Carry the blame and kiss your ass goodbye.

Why don't you cut me loose, you don't need me  
Lift up your dress and walk away  
There's nothin' left you can say to please me  
You're just a dog who's had it's day  
You beat around the bush and mumble  
About the good old days we had  
Your face grows longer as you crumble  
You had the good now taste the bad  
Let it all hit the fan  
Let it all hit the fan  
You promised me nothing would change you  
More empty words from an empty soul  
The same old stories you still cling to  
The truth be told you leave me cold  
You used to lead the dance and fumble  
Howl in the night you could not sleep  
You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled  
Too many promises come cheap.

He was lookin' like a fox  
That was runnin' from the hounds  
Sure little buddy, I can lighten up your load  
  
You half it up, I'll hit it up, I'll take it down the road  
  
Never had a better combination been planned  
'Cause Willie was a roadie with a rock 'n' roll band  
They were heads back, celebratin', drinkin' moonshine  
Heads down, here we go across another state line  
  
Tanked up and bullet proof

Anywhere they found a place  
And it was fat enough to rob

In the main racks, bass stacks  
Anywhere he thought it could  
Be hidden out of sight

To say the band wouldn't show

The bottles and the bodies started coverin' the stage  
Then the cops came running in  
And breaking up the riotin'  
When they saw the money falling  
  
Out the back of everything  
Hey little buddy think it's time to run and duck  
The robber and the roadie could be runnin' out of luck  
  
Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town  
They were sittin' by the highway like Jackson Browne  
They were stickin' out their thumbs  
In the middle of the night  
  
When they saw the car comin' with the spinnin' red light  
Wide eyed, tongue tied feelin' pretty stranded  
No use in runnin' they were caught red handed  
Pull 'em in, lock 'em up, put 'em in a row  
The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie

Because of some Cuervo passion

And you played the house wife roll for dude and his kids  
But now you can't get a break no matter how hard you try,  
Your life's on the line everytime you start up the ride  
Cus you never got ur L's but its hard not to drive  
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside  
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya  
Just because he said that you had a mouth on ya,  
Becus you would scream and holla  
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar  
And he didn't even bother to consider his child  
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?

He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type  
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight  
And you found out he was worse than ike  
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite  
Now your uncertain of this person you liked  
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive  
Cause you want it to work this time  
So you convince your mind that it fine  
But in time your gonna find  
That real love aint defined with violence  
And if you're crying every night  
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite  
To hit you in the eye then its time  
That you learn from the mistakes  
Of those that chose to stay  
Cause most of em are gone today  
And there's a gang of sistas  
That would probably still be with us  
If they would've just flown away Ne-yo gone and sang

Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus:  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
  
Verse 2:  
Saw you out yesterday  
And I knew that you saw me  
You was with your new man  
And I was with some random peeps  
Suddenly we caught eyes  
And I looked away before it got too hard to breathe  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus (2x):  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
I don't even think about you babe  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny

But I'm dying on the inside  
  
I'm dying...

Dying on the inside...

You gon' love me for my honesty  
Or you gon' hate me for being me  
Yeah, I'm sayin'  
One of the two is gonna happen  
With all that I can be  
Is what I am and who I am  
  
Chasing women when I should be recording  
Invite a couple then I invite some more  
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning  
And I've only done one song  
20k on champagne in the club  
Then 20k more just because  
That's 40k in 3 hours  
But everybody watching my section  
So it's alright babe,  
I know it may sound silly to you  
Truthfully it's silly to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be faithful but I keep running in the dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
I ain't got a condom here  
(Oh no)  
Too lazy to run to the store  
(And it's cold outside)  
But you just met her 3 hours ago  
Says the angel on my shoulder  
See but the devil he could talk real loud  
And on my decision I'm not proud  
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Help being good and older  
So it's alright  
I know it may sound reckless to you  
Truthfully it's reckless to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be thankful but I keep running into dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh I do alot of stupid shit  
Hoping I never have to pay for rent  
It's like I become rather an idiot  
Every extra million I get  
I thank God for my family and my crew  
'Cause I can be alot to put up with  
Much love to my people that don't mind  
The cracks in Mr. Perfect  
  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
Said you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson  
Perfection is just glorified opinion  
When in the grand scheming things it's our imperfections  
That truly make us perfect  
So do yourself a favor  
Find the beauty in your cracks

When all I fear

Now you say you love me  
But every time one of your little friends come at you with something

I wonder why they telling me to be cautious  
Filling the blanks while the drama is pouring  
I don't pay attention, I don't really read it too often  
Got niggas hating on me for years I holds it down  
Talking bout the women I'm fucking and the money I spend  
Why they tripping? already knowing that I'm destined to win  
Use it to motivate the grind and they at it again  
Damn, they mad at me, sneak... and throwing a little jab at me  
See me and be mad happy  
Half filled wine glasses as the time passes  
Cooler breeze, eye cashing with the fine accent  
Still on my shit though, remember when I was piss posed  
So now I'm surrounded by powerful niggas that get dough  
Huh, I prolly got your girlfriend wanting to get low  
Infatuated by all the haters, I need to get more

We get the jealousy and envy  
Cause she can never be you

And she mad at him cause he can never be me  
And she mad at you because you better than she  
They hit the blogsites to see the highlights  
How lighter they life, talking bout our life  
We doing things haters can only dream  
This kinda be messing with they up esteem you know  
  
Do me a favor, keep your nose up out my situation  
Besides your angering mind, your time is what you wasting  
Been through bs in life, can show a demonstration  
But built my shit from the ground up, renovation  
The past lurking, I see they hurting I stall them out  
You where you at for a reason, nothing to talk about  
The roads to success been a lot of ups and downs  
Doing you up, they merry goes, they come around

We don't got a lot in common  
We don't like a lot of the same things  
More than most of the time  
I find myself compromising

She's up when I'm down  
She's on when I'm off  
But when it come to love  
We're cut from the same freaky piece of cloth

She likes it fast, I take it slow  
I have a guess, she wanna know  
And that's the way it go  
I like the hot, she like the low  
But when it come to sexual  
Baby we're so compatible

I prefer your old shit to your new shit  
That song with Pitbull, it was kinda cool  
But after that, you went left and I couldn't fuck with you""  
Well damn, couldn't help but appreciate  
That she was bold enough to say this to my face  
She even went as far to give me her Twitter name  
She said, ""I tweeted you and told you the same thing""  
But, she said, ""I never thought I'd meet  
And you cuter in real life than on TV  
You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want, what the hell you want with me?""

Between what you really want and what you can get  
I can have anything, but I don't want just anything  
I want you tonight, I want you

She type stubborn, like her daddy, but she don't know him  
Got me feelin' like I ain't good enough  
I ain't a D-boy or a thug so I ain't hood enough  
Or maybe it's the other way around and shawty's self esteem is down  
Not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck, nah mama  
I'm really tryna get to know  
What's under your garden, not just what's under your clothes

And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Saying nothing, lying where the sun is  
Baking down upon our sides  
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses  
Your hands gentle in reply  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Child, touch my soul with your cries  
And the music will know what we've found  
I, hear a hundred good-byes  
But today I hear only one sound  
The moment we're living is now  
Now now now now now now now  
  
Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing  
Cools the sweat inside my palms  
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing  
As you lay sleeping in my arms  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
No the grass won't pay no mind

Warm summer showers

The gleaming candlelight still shining bright

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance  
From fields I used to roam

About the moonlight on the Wabash

A man and a woman  
Some can and some can't and some can't  
  
Two broken hearts lonely looking houses  
Where nobody lives  
Two people each having so much pride inside  
Neither side forgives  
  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Such a waste of two lives  
Its my belief  
Pride is the chief cause in the decline  
In the number of husbands and wives  
  
[Chorus]

Neil Diamond,I Am The Lion,/n/neil+diamond/i+am+the+lion_20256521.html,"There was a flood and many poor men were killed.  
And that is why our house is built on the top of a hill.  
The plains are like a friend, why can't we live on them?  
And if a flood should come, why can't we run?  
  
I am the lion, bellowing out in the night.  
We had a cow, I left it alone to graze.  
And walked to the stream and when I returned, it was stolen away.  
But now the cow is gone and we don't need a farm.  
  
We have not one thing they  
Would steal away.  
  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am... the lion.

Such were the plans I'd made  
For she was a lady  
And I was a dreamer  
With only words to trade  
You know that I was born for a night like this  
Warmed by a stolen kiss  
For I was lonely  
And she was lonely  
  
Ride, come on baby, ride  
Let me make your dreams come true  
I'll sing my song  
Let me make it warm for you  
  
I'll weave his web of rhyme  
Upon the summer night  
We'll leave this worldly time  
On his winged flight  
  
Then come, and as we lay  
Beside this sleepy glade  
There I will sing to you  
My Longfellow serenade  
  
Longfellow serenade  
Such were the plans I made  
But she was a lady  
As deep as a river  
And through the night, we stayed  
  
And in my way, I loved her as none before  
Loved her with words and more  
For she was lonely  
And I was lonely

How I wish I could borrow

Lips like strawberry pie  
Sandra, the long hair and pig tails  
Can't make up my mind  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them  
Said it, and it was true  
But I can't have both of them  
Don't know what to do

Cut deep by the sound of rejection  
Love burns in the soul of the seeker  
Blue shadows in every direction  
  
Love burns when the heart is uncovered  
In the rage of the coldly storm  
Love burns  
Through the night and the morning  
  
Till the frozen heart is warm

Thinkin' I can find her  
Maybe if I find her,

I spend a year travelin' 'cross the ocean  
Without goin' anywhere  
A hundred miles to the nearest phone  
A thousand miles from a place called home  
And all alone in my despair

Knowin' what I know now  
Thought I'd be a teacher

But if you ask me  
It don't seem right  
To spend my life without you there

Will somehow speak and you'll appear

Go too long without it,  
Nothing really means a thing

Might be the only chance we get  
Let's don't forget 'bout you and me

Tonight's the night I've waited for  
Because you're not a baby anymore  
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
What happened to that funny face  
My little tomboy now wears satin and lace  
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
When you were only six  
I was your big brother  
Then when you were ten  
We didn't like each other  
When you were thirteen  
You were my funny valentine  
But since you've grown up  
Your future is sewn up  
From now on you're gonna be mine, so  
  
If I should smile with sweet surprise  
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes  
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

Neil Sedaka,Here We Are Falling In Love Again,/n/neil+sedaka/here+we+are+falling+in+love+again_20613354.html,"In love so many fall but rarely do we rise in love  
We sing the saddest song,  
Lamenting to ourselves how bad we feel when love goes wrong  
I know I've been in love so many many times before  
And swore to all my friends  
That I would never never fall in love again  
  
Chorus  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
In dreams I often see a never ending kind of love  
That glides on golden wings  
Above the everyday affairs and ordinary things  
In love so many fall from dizzy heights of fantasy  
To find their love in flames  
So very sure that it was nothing more than just a game  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
Music  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love

Let me show, the world, that I'm, not through  
Let me touch, your heart, the way I used to do  
  
Sing me, sing me, now I got a song to be sung

Sing me, sing me, won't someone please let me out

Tell me would you want to sing me?  
Don't say I'm gone, never more to live on  
Somebody's got to sing me  
  
Let me fill , the air, with my, old song  
If I let, you down, tell me where did I go wrong

It seems we couldn't solve lifes problems  
Maybe it's because we tried so seldom  
So much must change today  
That I can only hope and pray

As I watch you leave the room that I'll see you very soon  
And it's all that I can do to keep from running after you  
And though I wanted you  
I let you walk away  
  
It's just a simple case of heartache  
My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake  
Somewhere along the line I hope we can make amends  
  
I believe that nothing lasts forever  
Promises won't help us stay together  
You may come home one day  
'Til then I only hope and pray

The girl you used to be.  
Once you used to live for life  
And now you live for sympathy.  
True, your heart's been broken  
And you got the right to cry,  
But if you're gonna keep it up  
The sunshine's gonna pass you by.

Take each raindrop, make the rain stop.

Even so she musn't know that I've loved her from the start  
She needs a friend now more than a new romance  
I'd love to take her in my arms but I can't take the chance

To move on in and make his dreams come true

I'm bored to tears when my heart hears that she loves someone else  
I tell her I'm sorry but it's really just a lie  
Cos every time he hurts her I'm so happy I could die

I love the lady and I want to make her smile  
I know she's lonely but it only hurts for a little while  
Soon as it's over you know the sun is gonna shine  
And when she's ready for someone new, guess who's first in line

the stars burned brightly and I clung to you tightly

Your love quickly faded out of sight

When spring showed her April smiling face,  
you were no longer around.

when she shed her inhibitions,  
Too many scenes in limousines

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four

nobody wants her any more.  
There was a time she could have shown them how,

that she made it with Mick Jagger  
Oh - but there's no doubt, when the truth comes out,  
true love will always conquer,  
She didn't get Mick, but she got a kick  
and a black eye from Bianca.

Just an autograph book and a stereo,

She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,  
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the Troubador.

And all the lights are low,  
What am I gonna do when I recall  
The love we used to know.  
I remember the happiness we knew,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
What am I gonna do on Wednesday night  
When I used to call you on the phone,  
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop  
When I show up alone.  
There all ask me what's become of you,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
At the movies or at the football game,  
Please believe me, nothing's gonna be the same.  
  
So what am I gonna do on Saturday night  
Whan everything goes wrong,  
How am I gonna feel when the radio  
Plays our favourite song.  
I'm so lonely just like Mr. Blue,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.

And I know he's lookin' there for me  
  
In the crowd of a million people

And then I'll climb to the highest steeple  
And tell the world he's mine

Let the song ignite the spark and you can hear the love  
Hush of evening and the rustling of the leaves  
The murmur as a baby breathes and you can hear the love  
  
Chorus  
Her body moves just like a symphony she needs you  
To be the one who's harmony will guide her  
And let her know she's getting through  
And you can hear the love  
Sometimes it sounds just like a never ending choir  
She puts your words to music's sweet desire  
And whenever she is near, you can hear the love  
(Don't you know that you can feel it, touch it, always hear the love)  
  
Tender touches to the rythm of the night  
Written down in candle light beneath the stars above  
Sweetly woven in a perfect applique  
Listen to the music play and you can hear the love

They tore you down and plowed you under.  
You're only real with your make-up on  
How could I see you and stay too long?  
  
All along the Navajo Trail,  
Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.  
Waitresses are cryin' in the rain  
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?  
  
Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids  
Sure ain't happy, neither are the kids.

And I'm such a heel for makin' her feel so bad.

An ambulance can only go so fast  
It's easy to get buried in the past  
When you try to make a good thing last.

There's room at the top for private detection.  
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter,  
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.

'Cause I know it ain't me, and I hope it isn't you.  
  
Well, I'm up in T.O. keepin' jive alive,  
And out on the corner it's half past five.  
But the subways are empty  
And so are the cafes.

And I still can hear him say:  
You're all just pissin' in the wind  
You don't know it but you are.

And they lifted many stones.

He had all of the lowdown  
From the bank heist last night  
His best friend was the robber  
And his wife was a thief  
All the children were killers  
They couldn't get no relief  
The bungalow was surrounded  
When a voice loud and clear  
Said, Come on out with your hands up  
Or we'll blow you out of here.  
There was a face in the window  
The TV cameras rolled  
Then they cut to the announcer  
And the story was told.  
  
The artist looked at the producer  
The producer sat back  
He said, What we have got here  
Is a perfect track  
But we don't have a vocal  
And we don't have a song  
If we could get these things accomplished  
Nothin' else could go wrong.  
So he balanced the ashtray  
As he picked up the phone  
And said, Send me a songwriter  
Who's drifted far from home  
And make sure that he's hungry  
Make sure he's alone  
Send me a cheeseburger  
And a new Rolling Stone.  
Yeah.  
  
There's still crime in the city,  
Said the cop on the beat,  
I don't know if I can stop it  
I feel like meat on the street  
They paint my car like a target  
I take my orders from fools  
Meanwhile some kid blows my head off  
Well, I play by their rules  
That's why I'm doin' it my way  
I took the law in my hands  
  
So here I am in the alleyway  
A wad of cash in my pants  
I get paid by a ten year old  
He says he looks up to me  
There's still crime in the city  
But it's good to be free.  
Yeah.  
  
Now I come from a family  
That has a broken home  
Sometimes I talk to Daddy  
On the telephone  
When he says that he loves me  
I know that he does  
But I wish I could see him  
I wish I knew where he was  
But that's the way all my friends are  
Except maybe one or two  
Wish I could see him this weekend  
Wish I could walk in his shoes  
But now I'm doin' my own thing  
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad  
Although my home has been broken  
It's the best home I ever had  
Yeah.  
  
Well, I keep gettin' younger  
My life's been funny that way  
Before I ever learned to talk  
I forgot what to say  
I sassed back to my mom  
I sassed back to my teacher  
I got thrown out of Bible school  
For sassin' back at the preacher  
Then I grew up to be a fireman  
Put out every fire in town  
Put out anything smokin'  
But when I put the hose down  
The judge sent me to prison  
He gave me life without parole  
Wish I never put the hose down  
Wish I never got old.

Somewhere a blues guitar  
Plays echoes in the alleyway  
The Tijuana dawn  
Claims another day  
The golden sun  
Rises on the runway  
The pilot understands  
The money changes hands  
Inside the jet the briefcase snaps. Goodbye.

There lives a great bullfighter  
His eyes are screaming blue  
His hair is red as blood  
And when the gate goes up  
The crowd gets so excited  
And he comes dancin' out  
Dressed in gold lame  
He kills the bull and lives another day.

Where the farmers used to live

Your battery's dead  
Twist and shout

There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
Bailout coming but it's not for you  
  
Got my flat screen

Missed the Raiders game

If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are lookin' good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare.

Not too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold 'way out there.

I walked these streets with you  
Here I am with this old guitar  
Doin' what I do.  
  
I always expected  
That you should see me through  
I never believed in much  
But I believed in you.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
From Marilyn to Madonna  
I always loved your smile  
Now we're headed for the big divorce  
California-style.  
  
I found myself singin'  
Like a long-lost friend  
The same thing that makes you live  
Can kill you in the end.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
Sometime it's distorted  
Not clear to you  
Sometimes the beauty of love  
Just comes ringin' through.  
  
New glass in the window  
New leaf on the tree  
New distance between us  
You and me.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still walk side by side  
Can we make it last

Eat hot dogs.

The spreading fear of growing old  
Contains a thousand foolish games

Allow another boulevard to claim  
A quiet country lane  
It's insane.

Where the showman shifts the gears

Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again

I didn't have the cash

I still couldn't close my eyes.

And it ran away with me  
I would not sign my autograph  
Or appear on TV  
Or see or be seen  
  
Living in the country  
Looked good to me  
Smoking grass while the summer passed  
In the real organic sea  
Where everything was green  
  
Then we had a kid and we split apart  
I was living on the road  
And a little cocaine went a long, long way  
To ease that different load  
And my head did explode  
My head did explode.  
  
I thought I was an Aztec  
Or a runner in Peru  
I could build such beautiful buildings  
To house the chosen few  
Like an Inca from Peru.

Like friends and enemies  
I tried leave my past behind  
But it's catching up with me

It's alright  
I know it's alright.  
  
Down the dusty road  
To the forest church  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why  
On the ocean wave  
In the billowing sky  
Let wander there  
Let me wonder why.  
  
Let the angels ring the bells  
In the holy hall  
Let them hear  
The voice that calls.  
For the love of man  
Who will understand  
It's alright  
But I wonder why.  
  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.  
I wonder why.

I was driving way too fast  
Couldn't stop though  
So I let the moment last  
I'm for rollin'  
I'm for tossin' in my sleep  
It's not guilt though  
It's not the company I keep  
  
People my age  
They don't do the things I do  
They go somehwere  
While I run away with you  
I got my friends  
And I got my children too  
I got her love  
She's got my love too  
  
I can't hear you  
But I feel the things you say  
I can't see you  
But I see what's in my way  
Now I'm floatin'  
Cause I'm not tied to the ground  
Words I've spoken  
Seem to leave a hollow sound  
  
On the long plain  
See the rider in the night  
See the chieftain  
See the braves in cool moonlight  
Who will love them  
When they take another life  
Who will hold them  
When they tremble for the knife  
  
Voicemail numbers  
On an old computer screen  
Rows of lovers  
Parked forever in a dream  
Screaming sirens  
Echoing across the bay  
To the old boats  
From the city far away  
  
Homeless heroes  
Walk the streets of their hometown  
Rows of zeros  
On a field that's turning brown  
They play baseball  
They play football under lights  
They play card games  
And we watch them every night  
  
Need distraction  
Need romance and candlelight  
Need random violence  
Need entertainment tonight  
Need the evidence  
Want the testimony of  
Expert witnesses  
On the brutal crimes of love  
  
I was too tired  
To see the news when I got home  
Pulled the curtain  
Fell into bed alone  
Started dreaming  
Saw the rider once again  
In the doorway  
Where she stood and watched for him  
Watched for him  
  
I'm not present  
I'm a drug that makes you dream  
I'm an aerostar  
I'm a cutlass supreme  
In the wrong lane  
Trying to turn against the flow  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the giant undertow  
  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the ocean  
I'm the giant undertow  
I'm the ocean

I miss the dizzy heights.  
All the manic, magic days,  
And the dark, depressing nights.  
  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the highs and lows,  
All the climbing, all the falling,  
All the while the wild wind blows,  
Stinging you with snow  
And soaking you with rain  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the pain.  
  
Mountains make you crazy  
Here it's safe and sound.  
My mind is somewhere hazy  
My feet are on the ground.  
  
Everything is balanced here  
And on an even keel.  
Everything is perfect  
Nothing's real...  
Nothing's real.  
  
And I miss the mountains.  
I, I miss the lonely climb.  
Wand'ring through the wilderness.  
And spending all my time  
Where the air is clear  
And cuts you like a knife  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss my life.  
I miss my life.

Nick Cave,As I Sat Sadly By Her Side,/n/nick+cave/as+i+sat+sadly+by+her+side_20313284.html,"As I sat sadly by her side  
At the window, through the glass  
She stroked a kitten in her lap  
And we watched the world as it fell past  
Softly she spoke these words to me  
With brand new eyes, open wide  
We pressed our faces to the glass  
As I sat sadly by her side  
She said, father, mother, sister, brother  
Uncle, aunt and nephew, niece  
Soldier, sailor, physician, laborer  
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest  
Earth and moon and sun and stars  
And planets and comets with tails blazin'  
All are there forever fallin'  
Fallin' lovely and amazin'  
Then she smiled and turned to me  
And waited for me to reply  
Her hair was fallin' down her shoulders  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
The kitten she did gently pass  
Over to me and again we pressed  
Our different faces to the glass  
That may be very well, I said  
But watch the one fallin' in the street  
See him gesture to his neighbors  
And see him trampled beneath their feet  
All outward motion connects to nothin'  
For each is concerned with their immediate need  
Witness the man reachin' up from the gutter  
See the other one stumblin' on who can not see  
With tremblin' hand I turned toward her  
And pushed the hair out of her eyes  
The kitten jumped back to her lap  
As I sat sadly by her side  
Then she drew the curtains down  
And said, oh, when will you ever learn?  
That what happens there beyond the glass  
Is simply none of your concern  
God has given you but one heart  
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers  
And God does not care for your benevolence  
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others  
Nor does he care for you to sit  
At windows in judgment of the world He created  
While sorrows pile up around you  
Ugly, useless and over inflated  
At which she turned her head away  
Great tears leapin' from her eyes  
I could not wipe the smile from my face  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side

The tide of public opinion had started to abate  
The neighbours, bless them, had  
Turned out to be all talk  
I could see their frightened faces  
Peering at me trough the gate  
  
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure  
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope  
Of keeping track of it  
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure  
And I remembered other ones who  
Had died from the lack of it  
  
And in my best shoes I started falling  
Forward down the street  
I stopped at a church and jostled trough the crowd  
And love followed just behind me  
Panting at my feet  
At the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud  
  
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God  
I searched trough the pictures in a  
Leather-bound book  
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood  
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a  
Fisherman's hook

All was bright and new  
And it seemed to me that most  
Destruction was beeing done  
By those who could not choose  
Between the two  
  
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboya, clones  
The streets groan with little Caesars,  
Napoleons and cunts  
With their building blocks and their tiny  
Plastic phones  
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs  
Down their fronts  
  
I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers  
The Mangolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet  
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds  
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat  
  
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns  
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands  
Great cracks appear in the pavement,  
The earth yawns  
Bored and disgusted, to do us down

Not know

Deepening snow  
As I search, in and out, above,  
About, below

All rabid in their blindness  
They dragged the snake outside  
Chopped it open with an axe  
And the ground soaked  
In the milk of human kindness  
So Long  
Farewell  
So Long  
  
But the brown ape escaped  
And was heard to roam the ranges  
Clanking it's heavy chain  
Down in the valley it sang to it's friend  
Whom he may never see again

Nick Cave,Far From Me,/n/nick+cave/far+from+me_20100071.html,"For you dear, I was born  
For you I was raised up  
For you I've lived and for you I will die  
For you I am dying now  
You were my mad little lover  
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over  
You who are so far from me  
Far from me  
So far from me  
Way across some cold neurotic sea  
Far from me  
  
I would talk to you of all matter of things  
With a smile you would reply  
Then the sun would leave your pretty face  
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes  
I keep hearing that you're doing best  
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast  
You are so far from me  
Far from me  
Far from me  
  
There is no knowledge but I know it  
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice  
That sails to me across the line  
From the ridiculous to the sublime  
It's good to hear you're doing so well  
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell  
Did you ever  
Care for me?  
Were you ever  
There for me?  
So far from me  
  
You told me you'd stick by me  
Through the thick and through the thin  
Those were your very words  
My fair-weather friend  
You were my brave-hearted lover  
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother  
So far from me  
Far from me  
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea  
Far from me  
Far from me

Talkin' back to Clock in slow and studied kicks

Collecting Table and Chairs and Sofa and so on and so on  
Gun wears his best blue suit, now let's take to the sky  
'We'll go dancin' and eatin' it up  
Get a bottle and push it on down'  
And let's just beat it up  
Transistor radio plays an overwhelmingly sad and lonely song  
Saying 'Where she gone? Where she gone? '

As a warning As a warning  
As a warning  
  
I'd given my nurse the weekend off  
My meals were ill prepared  
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb  
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room  
With all its teeth bared  
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared  
All its teeth bared.

And I took the small roads out of town  
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown  
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud  
Like a shroud Like a shroud  
Like a shroud  
  
There rose before me a little house  
With all hope and dreams kept within  
A woman's voice close to my ear  
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""  
""You looked soaked to the skin""  
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin  
Soaked to the skin

I extended a hearty salutation

Permit me to accept that invitation  
Invitation That invitation  
That invitation  
  
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all  
Throw caution to the reckless wind  
But with her hot cocoa and her medication  
My nurse had been my one salvation  
So I turned back home  
I turned back home I turned back home  
Singing my song

Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed  
Horribly 'round his ears  
Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars  
While you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours  
That you've been sleeping now for years  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo  
  
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where  
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair  
And deep into the sea  
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind  
And feel some presence there behind  
And turn to see what that may be  
Oh, babe, it's me  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo

A life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole

The whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast,  
And the street below showered in shards of broken glass,  
And all the drunks pourin' outta the dance halls,  
Starin' up at the smoke and the flames,  
And the blind pencil seller wavin' his stick,  
Shoutin' for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road,  
And me, if you can believe this, at the wheel of the car  
Closin my eyes and actually prayin',  
Not to god above, but to you, sayin',  
  
Help me girl, help me girl  
I'll love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls  
  
Some things we plan, we sit and we invent and we plot and cook up,  
Others are works of inspiration, of poetry,  
And it was this genius hand that pushed me up the hotel stairs  
To say my last goodbye,  
To her hair white as snow, and her pale blue eyes,  
Saying ""I gotta go, I gotta go, the bomb and the bread basket  
Are ready to blow,""  
In this town of men with big mouths and no guts,  
The pencil seller's dog spooked by the explosion  
And leapin' under my wheels as I careered outta longwood on my way to you,  
Waiting in your dress, in your dress of blue  
  
I said thank you girl, thank you girl

And with the horses prancin' through the fields,  
With my knife in my jeans and the rain on the shield,

Where yesterday the multitude  
Screamed and cried my name out for a song  
Today the streets are empty  
And the crowds have all gone home  
  
I pass a million houses  
But there is no place that I belong  
All I knew to give you  
Was song after song after song  
  
All the truths I tried to tell you  
Were as distant to you as the moon  
Born 200 years too late  
And 200 years too soon  
  
I'm a child of this age  
Locked into the pages of your book  
And when I am but dust and clay  
And all the children stop to take a look  
  
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform  
And the heights I did aspire  
Or will they tear out the pages of the book  
To light a fire  
  
With the rain on my face  
There is no place that I belong  
Did you forget this fucking singer so soon?  
And did you forget my song?

Nick Cave,Long Black Veil,/n/nick+cave/long+black+veil_20100125.html,"(D. Del, M. Wilkins)  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
  
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
  
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
  
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear  
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries on my bones

I have gold chains, and the finest I have  
I'll apply them all to thee. ""  
  
""I can't get down and I shan't get down,  
Or stay all night with thee.

Kisses she gave him three.  
With a penny knife that she held in her hand  
She murdered mortal he.

""Get well, get well,"" said she.  
""Oh don't you see my own heart's blood  
Come flowin' down so free? ""  
  
She took him by his long yellow hair,  
And also by his feet.  
She plunged him into well water, where  
It runs both cold and deep.  
  
""Lie there, lie there, Love Henry,"" she cried,  
""Til the flesh rots off your bones.  
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville  
Will mourn for your return. ""  
  
""Hush up, hush up, my parrot,"" she cried,  
""Don't tell no news on me,  
Or these costly beads around my neck,  
I'll apply them all to thee.  
  
""Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot,"" she cried,  
""And light on my right knee.  
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold  
And hung on a willow tree. ""  
  
""I won't fly down, I can't fly down  
And light on your right knee.  
A girl who would murder her own true love  
Would kill a little bird like me. ""

Puts his hand 'cross his mouth

I lay amongst the buttercups  
I pulled on my coat and buttoned it up

To a place where your troubles can't follow  
Sail away, sail away

And the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us  
And the peril in everything  
It assured us that the worst had come true  
  
  
And all my sorrows made their bed beside me  
The shame, the disgrace and the brutality  
And she whispered then ""Let laughter flee.""  
For the worst, it has come true  
  
  
Dry your tears, forget while we're here  
Leave all your sorrows behind you  
Never lose heart, all things will pass  
To a place where your troubles can't find you

Her breath was warm against my throat  
We clung to each other so very close

To a place where your heart will not shame you  
Take my hand through this night without end

Of a motion back and forth.

Just whisper his name  
And here comes Sunday's slave  
  
The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay  
If you feel at a loss, man, just who is the boss-man  
Ask the blood of one of it's bad days  
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery  
He insists that he piss in your fist  
But he still takes the money anyway  
The master's a bastard  
But don't tell Sunday's slave  
  
Thursday's angered the master  
O. K. So Friday's gonna pay  
Thursday's angered the master  
Yeah, so Friday's gonna pay  
One night on the rack and he's back saddling up Saturday  
You can only whisper his name  
But not on Sundays  
Never on Sundays  
O Not on Sunday's slave

Nick Cave,That's What Jazz Is To Me,/n/nick+cave/thats+what+jazz+is+to+me_20100291.html,"Jazz  
Fire eating drag-queens dressed as society whores  
Crazy two timing bitches running round  
Ghetto blasting blasters, blasting magnificently  
Blossoms falling from the cherry trees  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
High buildings with crippled backs circle around my dreams  
I clutch at the greasy tails of my dreams  
White blossom falling from the cherry trees  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Ten bottles standing in a row military style  
With hats pulled low over their brows  
A thousand wasted hours  
Skeletons entwined fucking and braying? Fields  
Blossoms falling from the cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
History repeating itself like a  
All the great cars of the world in one massive collision  
All the doctors swallowed up by one incompetence  
All the great theorists and teachers eaten alive...  
Religious extacy and a blossom falling from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Blind fish being used as musical scales  
Sharks puffed for fish and whales  
I long to be by the sea where a blossom falls from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Three forms, four forms, five forms, six forms,  
Seven forms, eight forms, nine forms,  
A blossom falling from the cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
As Einstein said about his theory  
I love, I love, I love, I love jazz  
It's in your heart, it's in your soul, it's in your mind  
The colour of death, sweet vanilla essence  
Richard Harris and Donald Pleasance  
And a cherry blossom falling from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me

Now it begins, now that you're gone  
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn  
Watching that clock till you return  
And lighting that torch and watching it burn  
  
Now it begins, day after day  
This is my life ticking away  
Waiting to hear footsteps that say:  
Love will appear and this time will stay  
  
Each time you go  
I try to pretend  
It's over at last  
This time the big hurt will end

Nick Cave,The Carny,/n/nick+cave/the+carny_20591200.html,"And no-one saw the Carny go  
And the weeks flew by  
Until they moved on the show  
Leaving his caravan behind  
It was parked out on the south east ridge  
And as the company crossed the bridge  
With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed  
It shone, just so, upon the edge  
Away, away we're sad to say  
  
Dog-boy, Atlas, Man-drake, the geeks, the hired hands  
There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind  
In the hope that the Carny would return to his own kind  
  
The Carny left behind a horse so skin and bone that he'd named Sorrow  
And it was a shallow unmarked grave  
That that old nag was laid  
In the then parched meadow  
  
And it was the dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch  
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground  
While boss Bellini, waved his smoking pistol 'round  
Saying ''The nag was dead meat''  
''We can't afford to carry dead weight''  
The whole company standing about  
Not making a sound  
And turning to the dwarves on the enclosured gate  
The boss says ''bury this lump of crow bait''  
  
And the rain came hammering down  
Everybody running for their wagons  
Tying all the canvas flaps down  
The mangy cats growling in their cages  
The bird-girl flapping and squawkening around  
The whole valley reeking of wet beast  
Wet beast and rotten, sodden hay  
Freak and brute creation all packed up and on their way  
  
The three dwarves peering through their wagon's hind  
Moses says to Noah ''We shoulda dugga deepa one''  
Their grissom faces like dying moons  
Still dirty from the digging done  
  
And Charlie the Atlas to the three said  
""I guess the Carny ain't gonna show""  
And they were silent for a spell  
Wishing they'd done a better job at burrying Sorrow  
  
And the company'd passed from the valley into higher ground  
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow and on the mound  
Until nothing was left, nothing left at all  
Except the body of Sorrow that rose in time  
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil  
  
And a murder of crows did circle 'round  
First one, then the others flapping blackly down  
  
And the Carny's van still sat upon the edge  
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge  
  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
I say its funny how things go

All through the night  
  
On the seventh hour an angel came  
With many snakes in all his hands  
And I fled in fright  
  
I pushed off into the river  
And the water came around

And a knife in his jeans  
  
Along the loom of the land

From the tower at saint mary's  
Down to reprobate fields

Was all blessed and bright  
And sally breathed softly  
In the majestic night

And try to keep  
Your little hand upon my shoulder

Were turning their backs  
Past the rumbling station  
We followed the tracks  
  
We found an untrodden path  
And followed it down  
The moon in the sky  
Like a dislodged crown  
  
My hands they burned  
In the folds of her coat  
Breathing milky white air  
From deep in her throat

Your little head upon my shoulder

And warm in my palm

Was a magical thing  
That it shone gold in winter  
And silver in spring

Across the endless sands  
Just me and my sally

I began to warm and chill  
To objects and their fields,  
A ragged cup, a twisted mop  
The face of Jesus in my soup  
Those sinister dinner meals  
The meal trolley's wicked wheels  
A hooked bone rising from my food  
All things either good or ungood.

She came to me and I saw in her eyes  
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes

She moved her mouth but there came no sound

Or if she'll ever return to help me know  
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Sunshine's all day long  
Narcotics far too strong  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
Cars won't stop for no one  
But don't you think that you're just rolling down  
Think you are a spy  
Gonna shoot them as they go by  
Well, no cars  
No cars  
Won't stop for no one  
  
Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway

How it cures and frees the soul  
Makes you whole and all that other stuff  
But I was kissed by lady luck  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you  
  
Sometimes it gets so very hard  
It's like we're trying to tear each other apart  
With every scar a deeper love revealed  
Now there's nothing left to conceal  
No there's nothing left to conceal  
  
With every turn it's like we hit a wall  
Do you see it the same way  
And I don't want to complicate it  
But I hate this place  
And there's only so much that I can take  
Before this glass heart breaks  
  
And I know I've got to let you go  
You were gone so long  
And I didn't even know  
It's just that I love you so  
And I know that I'm stuck on you  
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you

Visions of the things to be  
The pains that are withheld for me  
I realize and I can see...

That suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please.  
  
I try to find a way to make  
All our little joys relate  
Without that ever-present hate  
But now I know that it's to late, and...

The game of life is hard to play  
I'm going to lose it anyway  
The losing card I'll someday lay  
So this is all I have to say

The only way to win is cheat  
And lay it down before I'm beat  
And to another give my seat  
For that's the only painless feat

The sword of time will pierce our skins  
It doesn't hurt when it begins  
But as it works it's way on in  
The pain grows stronger... Watch it grin but...  
  
Refrain  
  
A brave man once requested me  
To answer questions that are key  
Is it to be or not to be  
And I replied 'oh why ask me? '  
  
'Cause suicide is painless  
It brings on many changes  
And I can take or leave it if I please  
  
... And you can do the same thing if you please.

The reason for her smile  
What are her dreams  
When they've journeyed for a mile

And her brightly colured rings  
Make her princess of the sky

Did she come  
From a strange world  
And leave her mind behind  
Her long lost sighs  
And her brightly coloured eyes

And tell your brothers I'm in town  
Put a bounty on my head  
And tell my parents that I'm dead  
And hope to hell I'm never found  
You can steal me the keys  
To your daddy's Cadillac  
You can tamper with the brakes  
Call it a mistake  
And pray I'm never coming back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C'mon, mmm, oh  
  
(You can dig me up a grave  
And try and stick me in the ground  
You can tie me to the bed  
And try and beat me half to death  
But you can never keep me down)  
  
And I will survive  
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess  
You're my California queen  
Like the duchess of Detroit  
And every city in between  
You can slap me in the face  
And you can scream profanity  
Leave me here to die alone, but  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home

In the old corn field  
Underneath the tractor wheel  
Thought I'd dig  
Till I'd found it first  
Broke my back  
And died of thirst

You can pray to God

The one we all dream of

I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.  
  
Tonight, out on the street out in the moonlight  
And damn it this feels too right  
It's just like deja vu  
Me standin' here with you

So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
You're never gonna be alone!  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone.  
  
And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,  
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
We're gonna take the world on  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh,  
You've gotta live every single day,  
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Don't let it slip away,  
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun  
Every single day,  
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be there all the way,  
I won't be missing one more day,  
I'm gonna be there always,  
I won't be missing one more day.

I never knew we ever went without  
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out  
  
And this is where I went to school  
Most of the time I had better things to do  
Criminal record says I broke in twice  
I must of done it half a dozen times  
  
I wonder if it's too late  
Should I go back and try to graduate?

Blew every dollar that we ever made  
The cops hated us hangin' out  
They said somebody went and burnt it down

And sing along with every song we know  
We said someday we'd find out how it feels  
To sing to more than just a steering wheel

Please don't hate, look don't judge  
For I know not just what I've done

Lying face down in the mud  
For I know not just what I've done

And dread the day you might be gone

Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore""

You moved in last Friday night  
And I just couldn't wait  
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday  
But a lineup formed outside your door  
And I was way too late  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God, I want to be that someone that you're with  
  
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday  
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake  
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at four AM  
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow

Tattoos on her left hip  
She bending as your spending  
There's no ending it so baby come on  
Dressed up like a princess  
Bettin' that her skin smells better

Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train  
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon  
  
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall  
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked 'em all  
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon  
  
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor  
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more  
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just sitting around, hangin' out this afternoon  
  
Landlord says I should buy a tent  
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent  
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon  
  
Down on the corner in a seedy bar  
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR  
Had a few, to Suzy Q this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along

Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
  
Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock  
To see what time it is  
From the moment I wake up  
I just love being with my friends  
We barely get by but have the best times  
And hope it never ends  
We drink all day until we fall down  
So we can do it all again  
  
It's not the human walk  
It's the human race  
If you ain't livin' on edge  
You're takin' too much space  
So I doubt I'll figure out  
Just what to do  
'Bout to kick it around  
Hanging out this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long

Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart

And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more  
  
And this kind of pain, only time takes away  
That's why it's harder to let you go  
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you

Only makes me love you more  
  
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself  
Was it something that I did?  
Was there somebody else?  
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears  
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear  
Tonight I'm dying to tell you  
  
That trying not to love you, only went so far  
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart  
Now I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for

I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby  
Jump on this Harley  
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley  
Sip some Bacardi  
Then go pull up at the afterparty  
I think we make a perfect couple  
But you think I'm trouble  
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number  
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""  
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'  
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time  
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine  
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you  
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do  
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long  
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong  
Before I head home  
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn  
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)

Wonder why I don't call her  
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her  
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her  
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more  
She loves it when I'm in town  
Hate it when I'm not around  
I get her and wear down  
Next door neighbors hear the sound  
Pictures hittin' the ground  
Just enough to hold us down  
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round  
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy  
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady  
I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man

Look I'm legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you

Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it  
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song

And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate  
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend  
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me  
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony  
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Bridge: Skylar]  
So does she know I've been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you  
There's one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
[Outro: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?

Big wigs with a suit and tie  
And them big things got two inside  
Fuck worn with these ho niggas  
Don't do coke I don't blow nigga  
I don't tell niggas I show niggas  
And it's never less than like 4 niggas  
4 wings and some french fries  
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga  
He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga  
I cop Raris, don't test drive em  
Home theaters, can't best buy em  
These niggas that I roll with don't let a single thing get by em  
King pins and them drug lords  
Chi-town no gun lords  
Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for  
Malcom X daughter came at me  
Looking niggas ain't happy  
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis  
Smack bitches, no smack cam  
Whole fist, no back hand  
Pop pussy on a hand stand, they sucking dick like a band camp  
Call Web and then call Nitty  
Queens niggas in it's all hoodies  
Kidnapping and then rob niggas  
Call D-rock for a biggie  
Pussy ass lil rap niggas  
I fucked with real trap niggas  
Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas  
I'm with ebk, you on ebt  
Got a black nine, call it bet

Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any  
And if any nigga ever try to end me  
I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me  
You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?  
Straight killers I can call so many  
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki  
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food  
Shorties standing in the streets with tools  
Where I'm from we don't play no games  
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news  
Where I hang we don't say no names  
If you talk to cop I stay away from you  
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations  
You'll be out the station in a day or two  
Dedication and a little patience  
Leave the domination on my way to greatness  
Don't put yourself up in a situation  
Putting my relations in your conversations  
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation  
You get my position nigga better take it  
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never
made it  
I got old shit, killing your shit

Man, the last time I checked I was bubbling out  
Got to turn down shows, out in Dublin now  
  
Wait wait hold on, maybe they didn't get that here  
Like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear  
Swerve on them sorta like I missed that dear  
Press that little button on the sit back chair  
B-tch I do it cause I get it

If you got a million dollars you could put it up in debit

Lets go, lets ride,

And the only thing that change is the price of gold  
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul  
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold  
So do you take me to be who I am?  
To have and to hold till death do us part  
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part  
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?  
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe  
Then you say I won't survive if I leave  
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve  
I no longer need your attention, at ease

Here we go again, it's the game we love  
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs  
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs  
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged  
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs  
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves  
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs  
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs  
  
[Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Are you alone? Do you need someone?  
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?  
Thousand words don't change a thing  
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

I was too busy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul  
Where it ain't no Easy Pass, you got to use the toll  
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control  
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes  
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious  
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?  
Another slap to the face, another uppercut  
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya  
Not cause I wanna, get someone to imitate ya  
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya  
But is you stayin' or goin'?  
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it  
How come you never show it?  
All this love you speak of  
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)  
  
[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win  
And I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end

When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?  
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop  
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not  
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood  
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood  
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch  
That's when everything they write be a contradiction  
I tell em I do it for the love  
I do it for the hugs

I do it for the rich

With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin'

Well then why can't they make me believe it

And I'm mad cause you the best that I ever had  
  
Why'd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
I'll never love again

Enchantment has but one truth:

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young.  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary,  
The ringing of the division bell had begun.  
  
Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway,  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before time took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground,  
To a life consumed by slow decay.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
With friends surrounding  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse at our great lose of the other side  
Steps taken forward but sleepwalking back again,  
Dragged by force of some inner tide  
  
But the highest altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition,  
There's hunger still unsatisfied,  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon,  
Though down this road we've been so many times.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dark mist growing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
Forever and ever [x2]

Dancing with the spirit of the air

Making love to the gods above  
On my maiden voyage so bold  
Landing safely to the blue lagoon

My home was there and then  
These meadows of heaven  
Adventure-filled days  
One with every smiling face  
  
Please, no more words  
Thoughts from a severed head  
No more praise  
Tell me once my heart goes right  
Take me home  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me, I have but two faces  
One for the world,  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
  
Sparkle my scenery  
With turquoise waterfall  
With beauty underneath  
The Ever Free  
  
Tuck me in  
Beneath the blue  
Beneath the pain  
Beneath the rain  
Goodnight kiss for a child in time  
Swaying blade my lullaby  
  
On the shore we sat and hoped  
Under the same pale moon  
Whose guiding light chose you  
Chose you all  
  
I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped  
Again and again and again  
I know I will die alone, but loved  
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns  
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night  
And if you want  
Live long enough to see your friends betray you  
Years have I been strapped unto this altar  
Now I only have three minutes and counting  
I just wish the tide would catch me first  
And give me a death  
I always longed for  
  
Second robber to the right of Christ  
Cut in half - infacticide  
The world will rejoice today  
As the crows feast on the rotting poet  
  
Everyone must bury their own  
No pack to bury the heart of stone  
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well  
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell  
  
The morning dawned upon this altar  
Remains of the dark passion play  
Performed by his friends without shame  
Spitting on his grave as they came  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me, I have but two faces  
One for the world,  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
  
Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005  
Thomas was called from the cares of the world  
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day  
The music he wrote had too long been without silence  
He was found naked and dead  
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text  
  
Save me!  
  
Be still, my son  
You're home  
Oh when did you become so cold?  
The blade will keep on descending  
All you need is to feel my love  
  
Search for beauty, find your shore  
Try to save them all, bleed no more  
You have such ocean's within  
In the end  
I will always love you  
  
The beginning

But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished  
For Carter has come to free my beloved

When my sister came into the room  
She refused to say how my father was  
But i knew he'd be dying soon.  
  
And i was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad  
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father.  
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching  
His body now just eighty-eight pounds  
Blinded eyes still searching  
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.  
Dying alone, naturally.  
  
I was his favourite child, i had him a little while  
Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile  
Just when i needed him most, he was already a ghost  
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken  
  
Leaving me alone with all my troubles  
Not ever once touching me and saying  
""daugther, i'll help you get over.""  
Now he's fadig away and i'm glad to say,  
He's dying at last. naturally.  
  
It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart  
Believes the words that the bible said ""til death do us two part"".  
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day  
How could some english words so small affect someone so strangely?  
  
Taking her away from us, her soul included  
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.  
Loneliness is hell, i know so well,  
For i'm alone. naturally.  
  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Every night he was calling on me  
I wouldn't go to him.  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Three weeks for him to die.  
  
And after he died, after he died  
Every night i went out, every night i had a flight.  
It didn't matter who it was with  
'cos i knew what it was about.  
And if you could read between lines, my dad and i close as flies.  
I loved him then and i loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.  
  
Leaving me to doubt god in his mercy  
And if he really does exist then why does he desert me?  
When he passed away i smoked and drank all day,  
Alone. again. naturally.

It's the only time they ever gave us to spare  
To have a little fun  
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down  
That hung upon the wall  
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright  
How the folks would enjoy it  
They would sit all night and listen  
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight

How we take each other's love

Forgetting to give back, forgetting to remember  
Just forgetting a note of thank you

But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same  
We're all guilty  
Because all the tears  
Our eyes just can't hope to see  
But I don't think it's applicable to me  
The beauty that surrounds them

How we take each other's love  
The most precious thing without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to keep open the door  
But I understand some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see, we're just the same  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see

Isn't it a pity, isn't it a pity  
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us  
Because of all our tears  
Our eyes can't hope to see  
Maybe one day at least I'll see me  
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'

Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored  
  
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,  
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,  
I'd say that I had spring fever,  
But I know it isn't spring.  
  
I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,  
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.  
Oh, why should I have spring fever,  
When it isn't even spring?  
  
I keep wishing I were somewhere else,  
Walking down a strange new street,  
Hearing words I have never never heard,  
From a man I've yet to meet.  
  
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,  
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,  
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,  
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,  
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,  
That it might as well be spring,  
It might as well be, might as well be,  
It might as well be spring.

And negativity don't pull you through  
  
Don't put on any airs

They got some hungry women there  
And they really make a mess out of you  
  
Now if you see Saint Annie  
Please tell her thanks a lot  
I cannot move  
My fingers are all in a knot

She speaks good English  
And she invites you up into her room

And she takes your voice  
And leaves you howling at the moon

You must pick one or the other  
Though neither of them

Because the cops don't need you

Who looked so fine at first  
But left looking like a ghost

But soon hit the harder stuff  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me  
When the game got rough

Looking everywhere  
Haven't found him yet  
He's the big affair  
I cannot forget  
Only man I ever think  
Of with regret

To add his inital  
To my monogram  
Tell me  
Where is the shepherd  
For this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody  
I'm longin' to see  
I hope that he turns  
Out to be  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb  
Who's lost in the wood  
I know I could  
Always be good  
To one  
Who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may  
Not be the man some  
Girls think  
Of as handsome  
To my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please  
To put on some speed  
Follow my lead  
Oh, how I need

No desire no ambition leads me

Spring is here

Why doesn't the night invite me

Nina Simone,Stars,/n/nina+simone/stars_20327277.html,"I was never one for singing what I really feel  
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share  
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story  
  
People lust for fame like athletes in a game,  
we break our collarbones and come up swinging,  
some of us are downed  
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always come up singing  
  
Some make it when they're young,  
before the world has done its dirty job  
and later on someone will say  
""You've had your day, now you must make way""  
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned  
or the many years forgetting what you know too well  
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down  
You try to make amends without defending  
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five  
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs  
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you  
Some make it when they're old  
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare  
or perhaps there's nothing there)  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always have a story  
  
Some women have a body men will want to see  
and so they put it on display  
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day  
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance  
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance  
  
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar  
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord  
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display  
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say  
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say  
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day  
  
Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all,  
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
And we always have a story  
  
So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around  
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down

With your face  
In the trough  
Wait your turn  
While they finish you off  
  
Don't know when it started  
Don't know how  
Should have found out  
Should have happened by now  
  
Got these lines  
On my face  
After all this time  
And i still haven't found my place  
  
I jump from every rooftop  
So high so far to fall  
I feel a million miles away  
I don't feel any thing at all  
  
I wake up  
On the floor  
Start it up again  
Like it matters anymore  
  
I don't know  
If it does  
Is this really all  
That there ever was?  
  
Put the gun  
In my mouth  
Close your eyes  
Blow my fucking brains out  
  
Pretty patterns  
On the floor  
That's enough for you  
But i still need more  
  
I jump from every rooftop  
So high so far to fall  
I feel a million miles away  
I don't feel any thing at all

Like I just knew it's something bad  
  
I just couldn't leave it alone  
I cut off that scab  
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut

I really shouldn't see

My blood just wants to say hello to you  
My soul is so afraid to realize  
How every little bit is left of me  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug the perfect drug  
Take me with you  
Without you everything just falls apart  
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
