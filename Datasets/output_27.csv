Bob Seger,Her Strut,/b/bob+seger/her+strut_20021896.html,"She's totally committed  
To major independence  
But she's a lady through and through  
She gives them quite a battle  
All that they can handle  
She'll bruise some  
She'll hurt some too  
But oh they love to watch her strut  
Oh they do respect her but  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Sometimes they'll want to leave her  
Just give up and leave her  
But they would never play that scene  
In spite of all her talking  
Once she starts in walking  
The lady will be all they ever dreamed  
Oh they'll love to watch her strut  
Oh they'll kill to make the cut  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Yeah love to watch her strut  
Watch her strut

Kesey next to me now darling, straighter than a railroad track  
I've been so high, my mind was dry  
  
I rent it out to farmers on the midnight ride  
That ain't all  
I ain't even got me a congressman I can call  
I seen 'em dumpin' garbage, in my rivers and lakes  
All right  
I seen 'em send up John Sinclair, you know  
Two joints is all it takes  
  
Then suddenly I was in a tree  
And dogs were barking up at me  
Can't you see  
I'm so damn apethetic, I can't believe I'm free  
  
As the senator he signs the bills you know  
  
And he's telling us which way we have to go  
  
Think it's time we got together and declared  
When you see them coming and you get so scared  
  
Rain is falling down, but you know I'm feeling fine  
I think I'll watch the tv set, let America steal my mind  
But you know I'm cool, Momma had a rule  
She didn't raise no fool to be true to someone else  
I'm gonna be myself  
I'm runnin' down that highway child  
  
Highway child

Bob Seger,Hollywood Nights,/b/bob+seger/hollywood+nights_20021984.html,"She stood there bright as the sun  
On that California coast  
He was a Midwestern boy on his own  
She looked at him with those soft eyes  
So innocent and blue  
He knew right then he was too far from home  
He was too far from home  
She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach  
They watched the waves tumble over the sand  
They drove for miles and miles  
Up those twisting turning roads  
Higher and higher and higher they climbed  
  
And those Hollywood nights  
In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
In her diamonds and frills  
Oh those big city nights  
In those high rolling hills  
Above all the lights  
She had all of her skills  
  
He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good  
See some old friends, good for the soul  
She had been born with a face  
That would let her get her way  
He saw that face and he lost all control  
He had lost all control  
Night after night  
Day after day  
It went on and on  
Then came that morning he woke up alone  
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA  
Wondering if he could ever go home  
  
And those Hollywood nights  
In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
It was giving him chills  
In those big city nights  
In those high rolling hills  
Above all the lights  
With a passion that kills

In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
In her diamonds and frills

Her father is a preacher, her mother's an ex-nun  
  
Now Louise she likes to boogie, down at the old ballroom  
She's got a crazy hophead boyfriend, digs freon balloons  
They ride on his Harley from the morning till the late afternoon  
They get stoned in the evening, and make love beneath the moon  
  
Now the old folks who are listenin'  
Prob'ly think think this song's obscene  
Say your children aren't like that  
Say my words are way off theme

Average product of the American dream  
I concede she's kind of naive but  
After all she's only thirteen

Yet before you turn to go  
It comes to you  
It's really true  
It's your love that's last to know  
  
Well we take our time we're polite and kind  
To the strangers that we meet  
And the ones who share the ones who really care  
They don't seem to make us feel complete

And we act so strong  
We're all such worldly souls

I loved to watch her do her stuff  
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep  
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers  
I used to watch 'em through the glass  
Well I'd stand outside at closing time  
Just to watch her walk on past  
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet  
As she made her way alone down that empty street  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat  
I drift back in time and I find my feet  
Down on Mainstreet

Way up firm and high  
  
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy  
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy  
Workin' on mysteries without any clues  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news  
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime  
In the sweet summertime  
  
We weren't in love oh no far from it  
We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit  
We were just young and restless and bored  
Living by the sword  
And we'd steal away every chance we could  
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods  
I used her she used me  
But neither one cared  
We were getting our share  
  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues  
Workin' on out night moves  
In the summertime  
And oh the wonder  
Felt the lightning  
And we waited on the thunder  
Waited on the thunder  
  
I woke last night to the sound of thunder  
How far off I sat and wondered  
Started humming a song from 1962  
Ain't it funny how the night moves  
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose  
Strange how the night moves

Took a bead on the northern plains and just rolled that power on  
  
Twelve hours out of Mackinaw City stopped in a bar to have a brew  
Met a girl and we had a few drinks and I told her what I'd decided to do  
She looked out the window a long long moment then she looked into my eyes  
She didn't have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin'  
  
Roll roll me away won't you roll me away tonight

And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right  
We never even said a word we just walked out and got on that bike  
And we rolled  
And we rolled clean out of sight  
  
We rolled across the high plains  
Deep into the mountains  
Felt so good to me  
Finally feelin' free  
Somewhere along a high road  
The air began to turn cold  
She said she missed her home  
I headed on alone  
  
Stood alone on a mountain top starin' out at the Great Divide  
I could go east I could go west it was all up to me to decide  
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin' and my soul began to rise  
And pretty soon  
My heart was singin'

So it went as we put out

Everything I asked about seemed private  
  
The captain strolled the bridge one night  
I stopped him in the evening light  
To ask him would it be all right to join him  
  
But he stood there like some idol  
And he listened like some temple  
And then he turned away  
  
All along the fateful coast  
We moved silent like a ghost  
The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us  
The wind came building from the cold northwest  
And soon the waves began to crest  
Crashing cross the forward deck  
All hands lost  
  
I alone survived the sinking  
I alone possessed the tools

Long damp halls and smells of must  
Faded walls and ancient rust  
Built on shifting sand  
And I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To smash that sucker down  
  
It was a marvelous sight to see  
A redhead workin' in a brasserie  
Five foot nine built to a tee  
Eyes so blue and bright  
All the drunks were just circling round  
I drank water and held my ground  
Later on we did the town  
And we caught every sight  
  
Cause I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To follow her down  
Sightseein' freein' my soul  
Sightseein' leavin' my soul  
  
It was a magical sight to me  
And Yves Tanguy in a gallery  
The 30's looking back at me  
As if he really knew  
I marveled at the artistry  
Predating or technology  
The vision there for all to see  
Bold and strong and true

To take that painting home

This old house is growing so old.  
  
Take a walk into the ballroom,  
Now it hardly looks the same.  
Now it's chandelier is shattered,  
Only stillness here remains.  
Long ago there was the laughter  
Through the stories that were told.  
This old house has grown so old.  
  
Carefull of the stairs,  
Don't sit on the broken chair.  
Peole passing by  
Used to pause out in the square.  
Now they go on by,  
No one even stops to stare.  
It's so all alone,  
No one cares.  
  
They'll tear down this house come morning,  
Build a new one in it's place.  
Put an end to all it's glory,  
Put an end to all it's grace.  
And the sun will set when evening comes,  
Stars will fill the sky -  
And stars will fill the sky.

There's no one there to touch, when things start going wrong  
You finally realise, you've never loved at all  
And everywhere you look, you see the white wall  
  
Your father's been too far, your mother's been too near  
And now you're on your own, withdrawing in your fear  
Through long and sleepless nights, the foxes are running free  
You long to be with them, when the scare meets the sea  
  
You climb and then you fall, and then you try again  
You curse yourself aloud, for living so weird  
And took it to the ground, your eyes are filled with tears  
Imprisoned there you lay, in the autumn of your years

Pull them up over my head

It was another day  
A perfect texas afternoon  
A mother and two children play  
The way they always do  
As they raced home from the mailbox  
A mother and her son  
Against a little girl of 6 years old  
The independant one  
  
The deputies went door to door  
Through all the neighborhood  
They said I got some news to tell you folks  
I'm afraid it aint so good  
Somehow something happened  
Someone got away  
Someone got the answers for what happened here today  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
Now the people from the papers and the local tv news  
Tried to find the reason  
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues  
Someone shouted hit and run  
The coroner cried foul  
Her blue dress was what she wore  
The day they laid her body down  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
I know tonight that theres an angel  
Up on heavens highest hill  
And no one there can hurt you baby  
No one ever will  
Somewhere someones conscience is like a burning bed  
The flames are all around you  
How you gonna sleep again  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no

A cabbie screams obscenities  
The horns are honking jazz in the night  
The street is lit like a Christmas tree  
This place its my amphetamine  
She junks me but its alright  
In her summer dress she parts the sea  
Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads  
Everybody else is gone but her and me  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
Sittin' on my stoop I lit one up  
Hit the ashes in my coffee cup  
And watch the world passin' me by  
Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart  
Ain't it funny how life imitates art?  
Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight  
  
But when she's walkin' down the street  
The sidewalks there to kiss her feet  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
She needs me, pleads me  
And wraps me in her loving charm  
She'll tease me, squeeze me  
But I'm the man when I'm in her arms  
  
Now the angels sing a melody  
They wrote for her explicitly  
And no one hears but her and me  
  
Now wait a minute  
Wait, I can't believe my eyes  
Who's that comin' round the corner?  
Oh she's lookin' fine ain't she?  
Get out the way!  
No, no, no, no, no get out the way!  
Oh look at those high heel sneakers

I prayed all night for water  
For this burning in my veins  
It was like my soul's on fire

Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore  
If I could choose the way I'd die  
Make it by the gun or knife  
'Cause the other way there's too much pain

I can't pick up that phone anymore  
And I need to confess  
If I don't say, ""I love you""  
Everything else is a waste of my breathe  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
To live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
As I whisper your name  
I wish you were here by my side  
And the only way that I find you  
Is when I close my eyes  
  
With my ring on your finger  
I hope and I pray  
That you know deep in your soul  
With every step that you take  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
I live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms

It's the little things that you do  
That make me want you more  
It's the way your hands are trembling  
But what they trembling for?  
  
It's the way the smile fits on your lips  
The way you hold me tight  
God knows I'd give everything  
To be in your arms tonight  
  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
Is to die in your arms

Restless in a far away bed,  
The stars are falling down  
And I'm half the world away,  
I'm just trying to close the distance,  
To feel each breath that you take,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like a wild arrow flying  
And I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew  
And every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
  
So you got me to believe,  
Made me turn on a dime,  
The writing on the wall  
Right in front of me  
Every song, every rhyme,  
  
But I don't need a thousand words,  
I need you safe in my arms,  
I'll be standing strong,  
I'll keep holding on  
When life tries tearing us apart,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,

Now I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew,  
  
No I ain't regretting  
Just how lost I'm getting  
Or the red lights I've been blowing through,  
My foot will find the pedal  
As I'm counting the lines,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,

The headlights make me blind,

When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you

Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Youve been the blood in my veins  
The only one who knows my middle name  
And the smiles they came easy cause of you  
You know that I love you, but I hate you  
Cause I know I can never escape you  
Let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark  
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take

Have I said too much  
Maybe I haven't said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch  
Maybe I've lost my guts - there, is that truth enough  
Hey now, hey now  
  
You know these love letters mix with whisky  
Just don't light a match when you kiss me  
Though Ill blow away, you know Ill be back soon

Its up and down, its hot and cold  
These complications  
Just keep on coming  
These aint no running  
When it comes to life that's how it goes  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
It could eat up  
If you try and keep it all inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
Theres gonna be thunder  
Theres gonna be rain  
Theres gonna be those times  
We both get caught up in the pain  
The realization  
Keeps sinkin in  
The way you make it  
Is learn to take it on the chin  
Round and round we go  
Its just another day  
With trouble knockin at your door  
Baby don't you know  
We can work it out  
Cause we always seem to find a cure  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
Well keep holdin on  
Through the changes that we feel inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days

The old man down on the corner  
Is downing in his pain  
I can see the sorrow in his eyes  
His tears, the leave a stain  
The streets have left him broken  
Hes in the final phase  
Its been a long hard road  
From his glory days.  
Theres a tatoo of his sweetheart  
Fading on his arm  
He talks of painful tragedy  
How he lost his lucky charm  
His memory is clouded  
From the thunder in this vein  
Hes vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain.  
On desperation avenue  
The devil takes his toll  
Where the pushers and the poverty  
Slowly claim your soul  
When you reached the realization  
That you just can't break the chain, no  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain (harlem rain).  
In your seach for tender mercy  
No one seemed to care  
The faith that used to be your crutch  
Is now your cross to bear  
You last yourself so long ago  
You don't know who to blame  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.

Hide my tears in the pouring rain, had my share of hurt and pain  
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain

Since I've had your love here in my hands

You lay it all down and walk away , before it's too late  
We danced all night as the music played  
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made  
There in the stains , we remain,  
No one left to blame

In some technicolor dream  
But the airs too thick for one of us to breathe  
I'm not fool enough to think  
You couldn't live life without me  
  
I didn't come this far to throw the towel in  
I didn't fight this hard to walk away  
If I aint smart enough to say I'm sorry  
Its just because the words got in the way  
  
I remember how it used to be  
I was you and you were me  
We were more than just the same  
Now these shoes don't fit, my skins too tight  
When you want a kiss, I take a bite  
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights  
  
Last night I drak enough to drown  
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health  
Look, we both know how much I've let you down

Someone to give it to you straight  
To find the soul throught flesh and bone  
My lifes a treasure, full of sunny weather  
But its left me feeling cold  
Now all you want to do is take me home

I hated you, cause I couldn't love myself  
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me  
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground

Bon Jovi,Letting You Go,/b/bon+jovi/letting+you+go_10044929.html,"It ain't no fun lying down to sleep  
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep  
I wish the stars up in the sky  
Would all just call in sick  
And the clouds would take the moon out  
On some one-way trip  
  
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend  
But somehow they drove me back here once again  
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul  
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home  
It would all have been so easy  
If you'd only made me cry  
And told me how you're leaving me  
To some organ grinder's lullaby  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue  
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to  
Well - me, these days  
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane  
Unless you're coming back for me  
That's one thing I know that won't change  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart  
And we'll find you somebody else new  
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips  
When I bet all that I had on you  
  
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard  
It's hard letting you go  
It's hard, so hard, it's tearing out my heart  
But it's hard letting you go

Bon Jovi,Love Ain't Nothing But A Four Letter Word,/b/bon+jovi/love+aint+nothing+but+a+four+letter+word_20249276.html,"She was waiting alone at the station  
Praying for her train to arrive  
Thinking 'bout her destination  
The tattered bag had all she had in life  
  
She turned her back on her family  
She turned her back on her friends  
She turned her back on a married man  
When she took off that wedding band  
  
She said, ""I'm giving up, silver clouds have turned to gray  
Had enough, there's got to be a better way""  
Giving up, you know you've gotta walk  
There's some things in life still worth fighting for  
  
Ain't no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
This time he said was the last time  
Last time he said just the same  
In your heart you know that they'll be a next time  
That your battered bones would have to explain  
  
Giving up, nothing's changing but the score  
Had enough, every night love turns to war  
Give it up, gave it all and wanted more  
It ain't nothing worth dying for  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
Forget your mama's Rosary beads  
To get you through this time of need  
You know you gotta cross that line  
You take it one day at a time  
  
Had enough, the silver clouds all turning gray  
I'm heading for a better day  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing, it ain't nothing now, baby

I let my fingers do the walking through the telephone book  
You can't catch a fish if you ain't got the hook

Send up a signal, throw me a line  
Somebody explain ""this funny Valentine""  
It might not be legal but it sure ain't a crime  
I'm one step from crazy and two steps behind  
  
I called Lieutenant Columbo from my TV set  
I've tried the Dating Game, I haven't found her yet  
I'm hoping that she's looking like a Penthouse Pet  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
We've been living together three years  
Two hours, twenty minutes, maybe four hundred beers  
You can't shop for love when you're shopping at Sears  
Love for sale, love for sale

My old lady, she played this joke on me  
I never looked where I forgot it would be

But now we sleep on separate sides and the sheets are cold  
Aw, I used to love your candy baby, now the store is closed  
  
I know my silence tears you up inside  
You built a fortress for your hurt to hide  
You think youve won, but its a tie  
cause nobody wins a war of pride

I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night.  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
You're just a number of the love lies.  
  
All alone you call it survival,  
He lost at love to a stranger's lines.  
Walking the streets, searching with vengence  
For a face that he dreams of night after night.  
  
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken.  
Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive?

Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet  
And took his life away.

Born down by the factories  
Cross the jersey city line  
Raised on radio  
Just a jukebox kid  
I was alright  
Just a small town homeboy  
With big time dreams  
Foollowing his conscience  
In a world full of extremes  
Fresh outta high school  
Only seventeen  
I was alright  
Blinded by my vision  
There ws just no turning back  
Lika a runaway train  
Life was steaming down the track  
Youd say Id never make it out  
But I kept on hanging on  
Every night I prayed to jesus  
And held my head up strong  
I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
My old mans independence  
Seemed good enough for me  
I was made in america  
Made in america  
Never cared much about politics  
Til I was twenty one  
But I woke up when lennon  
Found the wrong end of a gun  
He left his inspiration  
Before he said boodbye  
And we were alright  
We all lose out innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold  
When I kissed those younger days goodbye  
It almost broke my heart  
I was going to ghrough my growing pains  
I was driving in the dark  
But I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
I'm facing up to freedom  
And chacing down my dream  
I was made in america  
Yeah I was made in america  
Yeah we all lose our innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I just didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold

And I held my head up strong

Seems her chauffeur took a dive  
And sold her secrets to the sun

To be a saint, not a queen  
  
Two lustful lovers catch a spark  
And chase their shadows in the dark

It's slippin' away  
  
Last night I saw you out with my best friend  
When I'm with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I don't understand  
There's something there that's so hard to disguise  
  
Now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night  
Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
It's more than we bargained for  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid

I've been trying to find the meaning  
So I can write it down  
Staring out the window it's such a long way down  
I'd like to jump but I'm afraid to hit the ground  
  
I can't write a love song the way I fell today  
I can't sing no song of hope

Since you went away  
I sing this song to you wherever you are

I'm tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream  
Outside the world is burning  
Man it's so hard to believe  
Each day you know you're dying  
From the cradle to the grave  
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Strange enough these days  
I send this song to you whoever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Staring at the paper I don't know what to write  
I'll have my cigarette-well, turn out the lights  
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way  
But here in my delusion I don't know what to say  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
And I can't fight the feelings  
That are burning in my veins

Knocked me clean off my feet

I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs

The soul with holes aint gonna be the one you lose

As a jukebox  
But deadly just the same  
I could be as gentle as a newborn  
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane  
  
And we knew how to laugh  
And we knew how to cry  
Yeah, we sure knew how to live  
But we don't ever

Still they remained unspoken  
And we'd take them to the fiery  
Gates of hell

But when it's your brother  
Those things change  
'Cause love is just another word  
For trust  
So hear me when I say

Never say no

And don't let go

That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die

Through the pouring rain  
And we'll be standing like a soldier  
Who comes marching home again  
  
They ask what it is that I want written  
On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry  
  
My spirit is still riding somewhere  
Somewhere in this night  
When it's these three words that come to me  
As I kiss this world goodbye  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye

But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet  
  
'Cause old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me  
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea  
I have your back for each day that's gone by  
And I'll still have it till the day that I die  
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die  
  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind  
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
Appearances change but don't change who we are  
And old habits die hard

All alone in the dark  
No walls no windows  
Trying hard to define  
Heaven from hell  
Standing out in the rain  
With just one shadow  
Nothing to see or believe  
Beyond myself  
See my life going by  
Each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
All alone with my fears  
No words are spoken  
A story yet to be told  
Locked in my mind  
Hope is somewhere ahead  
Shining brightly  
But the past is always following close behind  
See my life going by, each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
Leading the way, leading the way

They practice love and they know what it takes  
No competition and no jealousy  
Living in freedom and humanity  
  
10.000 light years away, light years away far from pain  
Came to a place full of grace and of peace  
10.000 light years away from our fear  
  
Suddenly it's ringing in my ears  
Why is it now i don't want to be here  
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall  
God, how i wish that this dream would go on

Boney M.,Fever,/b/boney+m/fever_20022525.html,"Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever, that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever, when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever, in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And I know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever, when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever, in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody gots the fever [should be ""everybody's got...""]  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said ""Julie baby, you're my flame""  
  
Thou givest fever, when he kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm a fire  
Fever, yeah I burn for thou  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, ""daddy, oh, don't you dare!""  
  
You give me fever [should be ""he gives me fever""]  
With his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right?  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's a point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever, when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live, you learn  
Fever, 'till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
They give you fever, when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever, 'til you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)

I said I can't stand you  
With your honey touch  
This time you were cheating me  
One time too much  
Just then I remembered  
That a friend I knew  
Told me one thing  
I should never do  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance  
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance

Right next to me  
Mine just for the asking  
He said he would be  
But to leave my man  
Seemed to me all too strange  
And I'd say that I'm glad  
I didn't make the change  
Now our life is almost  
Like a Paradise  
Let me pass on to you  
This advice  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night  
You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right  
But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool  
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool  
Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell  
Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well  
Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight

And before the others caught him  
He jumped out and he was free  
He jumped out and he was free  
  
He made for the swamp lands  
It seemed a hopeless duel  
They had dogs and shotguns  
And they were mighty cruel  
But they couldn't find him  
He was too smart and strong  
Hiding' in the daytime  
Wandering all night long  
  
Working on the chain gang-No More [Repeat: x6]

Boney M.,We Kill The World,/b/boney+m/we+kill+the+world_10045409.html,"I see mushrooms, atomic mushrooms.  
I see rockets, missiles in the sky.  
Day by day, more and more,  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, poor world.  
  
Concrete's rising up,  
Where yearerday was park  
You heard the robin's song  
Heavy tractor runs  
Where air was clean and cool  
Make money, bringing fuel.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
A poor world, poor world.  
  
Fishes doomed to die  
As people live close by  
And oaktree falls with moon  
Parking lots will come  
With flowerfields were bright  
As junkyard covers sight!  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, is hurting bad,  
Poor world, is doomed to die.  
  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
We surely do  
In peace we do!  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
'cause we don't know  
What we are doing!  
  
We kill it  
One by one  
Don't realize!  
  
And nuclear piles stand like monuments  
Of destruction throughout over the country  
  
Promenades must go  
So cars can drive in row  
New fact'ry towers tall  
Farmhouse had to fall  
No flowers in the air  
Pollution everywhere.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
A poor world, poor world.  
  
Oceans in despair  
There's rubbish everywhere  
The seaweed chokes in mud  
Nature's had her lot  
With nuclear waste and rot  
And mushrooms bloom as clouds.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, is hurting bad,  
Poor world, is doomed to die.  
  
We kill the world...  
  
Don't kill the world  
Don't let her down.  
Do not destroy basic ground.  
Don't kill the world  
Our means of life.  
Lend ear to nature's cry.  
  
Don't kill the world  
She's all we have,  
And surely is worth to save.  
Don't let her die,  
Fight for her trees,  
Pollution robs air to breathe.  
  
Don't kill the world  
Help her survive  
And she'll reward you with life  
And don't just talk,  
Go on and do the one, who wins is you.  
  
Cherish the world,  
A present from god  
On behalf of all creatures,  
Made by the lord  
Care for the earth,  
Foundation of life  
Slow progress down help her survive

Boney M.,When A Child Is Born,/b/boney+m/when+a+child+is+born_20022479.html,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
And all of this happened  
Because the world is waiting  
Waiting for one child  
Black, white, yellow, no one knows  
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter  
Hate to love, war to peace  
And everyone to everyone's neighbour  
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever  
  
It's all a dream and illusion now  
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born

Oh, I wanna fall on over the ledge  
When that rain start fallin', I wanna call baby  
I wanna take a real good look at that ledge  
It ain't something you get over  
You might think you made it through  
You can turn your head and walk away, baby  
But it never takes its eyes off of you and  
It'll push your foot right through the floor board, baby  
Make you cut them streamers down and back  
You waste what's precious and you can't afford, baby  
It runs your life right off the track  
It'll keep you boilin' in that poison  
Only the truly twisted know so well  
You don't need drugs to show you heaven, baby  
'Cause there's plenty clean in hell  
I'd miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Oh, on over the ledge  
Yeah, the blues start callin'  
[Incomprehensible]  
Break it down

Oh baby I'm gonna crawl  
Crawl into your arm now  
Into your arm now

And change my life the way you've done.

And a siren wails over my head.  
But I'm all right, 'cause I have you here with me.  
And I can almost see through the dark there's light.  
If you knew how much this moment means to me,  
And how long I've waited for your touch.  
If you knew how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much.

Always layin' it on the line  
I don't think that when they called it love  
This what they had in mind

I'm on your side  
All you got to do now, darlin...  
  
Take my little heart and open wide  
Hey baby, I know we can work it out  
Might take a little mojo workin, baby  
But ain't that what love is all about?  
  
Hey, Baby, must be somethin bout this  
Push and pull  
Makes me wonder if we stir it up...  
Just to make sure things'll never get dull.  
  
Come on baby take the gloves off  
And then untie those shoes  
I got something more tantalizin  
For you left and right to do

Life can't go on this way  
And you need to change your view.  
So you packed up and moved out of my life.  
To find a world of your own.  
Even now that you've up and gone.  
For you there's still a place in my heart  
Only real love in my life  
That even time can't erase.  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind  
Everytime.  
I knew you cared  
Cause in your letters you would write and say  
That you missed my lovin' every day.  
Well if that's true,  
All I'd ever why  
Aren't you next to me.  
And you call me on the telephone  
Afraid because you're all alone  
Well, Baby, just remember  
Oh love will abide  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind

A little humility and trust

That ain't no reason to treat you like a snake  
Or to treat me like a slut  
And it's makin' me so angry  
Could we just lay back for a moment  
Before we wake up and find ourselves  
In a game that we both have lost?  
These easy cures and easy handsomes  
Somethin' tells me we can't afford the cost  
'Cause some things not fit for human ears  
Some things don't need to be discussed

They'll tell you one thing, me another

And goes too far

Back seat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel  
But they sure know how to make a fuss

And now he's makin' fried eggs an art

Well when the road gets too narrow

And he sees these words forming on her lips

Before this moment fades away I want to know you  
I've got lightening in my pocket, thunder in my shoe  
Have no fear I've got something here I want to show you  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you  
And in your eyes the distance left is closing  
I've got a feeling in my oceans  
Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields this prison is opening  
Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why  
They hope and try, live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire  
Angels wait to take me higher and higher  
Higher and higher

Blinded by magic in my baby's eyes  
All I ever dreamed of  
I saw you in white walking by my side  
  
But I still believe that one day  
Things work out for you and me  
And I still believe we can't be friends  
There's so much more for us to be...

I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So full of life And so many thing's that you wanted too  
My world was too small for you  
So try your wings the way I used to do  
  
But I still believe that one day  
When your world is cold and mean  
You will fly back home where you belong  
To the luckiest man you've seen...

I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So when I miss you like crazy  
I just take a walk to our place down by the sea  
To make a wish on a falling star  
And I wish you were here.... With me  
With me  
With me  
With me

I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,

Bosson,Love This Life,/b/bosson/love+this+life_20740938.html,"If you feel the whole world is against you  
And you're irritated about what someone said  
Remember  
You control the thoughts that you are thinking  
It's a choice you make and it's all inside your head  
  
When you're late for work and stuck in traffic  
And you feel like Michael Douglas in ""Falling down""  
And then some stupid driver makes you go ballistic  
Just kick back, relax  
And ignore that screaming down  
  
So, Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A happy thought  
Is all you need to keep the clouds away  
  
Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A little sunshine  
And everything is gonna go your way  
  
When you check the mirror in the morning  
You look pale and old and your waist's  
Hard to define  
And then your Doctor Slim is giving you a warning  
And you accept you'll never work for Calvin Klein  
  
So, love this life...  
  
Why do we worry about tomorrow today when  
Everyday proves us wrong about the worries we  
Had yesterday [x2]  
  
In 5 billion years or more the sun stops burning  
And this world will be a cold and lonely place  
And although our mother earth will keep on turning  
She will have to cope without the human race  
So it's time to love this life and seize the day  
  
So love this life...  
  
So love this life  
Love the ones that do not even deserve it  
And if you can't  
Just forgive them for the things they've done  
Love this life  
Love this life and let your troubled soul shine  
A little shine  
And everything is gonna go your way

And your heart is beating faster with the treat  
Your hands are soft and warm

But when it does don't despair  
Every space has someone just meant to be there  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
I know you're gonna make the best of your life  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
Lift up your eyes, it's the rest of your life

Leavin' without her  
Is too much to bear  
But when we're together  
Too much nothin' to share  
But too much love  
I've never seen  
Too much love  
I don't know what it means  
  
Not enough caring  
Too many lies  
Sooner or later  
One too many goodbyes  
I got no reason  
For hangin' around  
And all my possessions  
Start to weighin' me down  
But too much love  
I've never known  
Too much love  
I need some of my own

Cause I've never felt this way  
  
No one in this world  
Knows me better than you do  
So diary I'll confide in you  
  
Dear diary  
Today I saw a boy  
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me  
  
And I wondered  
Does he know what's in my heart  
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe  
  
Should I tell him how I feel  
Or would that scare him away  
Diary, tell me what to do  
Please tell me what to say  
  
Dear diary  
One touch of his hand  
Now I can't wait to see that boy again  
  
He smiled  
And I thought my heart could fly  
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?  
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends

From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
You promised yourself  
But to somebody else  
And you made it so perfectly clear  
Still I wish you were here now  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love,  
From the first kisses to the very last rose

You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you

How was I to know I'd miss you so?

Tired of you people sayin ""Britney""  
Tired of the pop that's a flop

Tired of the crap I take each day  
Tryin to do my song, tryin to do it my way  
Tired of the pop that's a flop  
That should never be  
On tv and in your teen magazines

Some you will, some you won't

We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn  
There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish  
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish  
I tied it to the top of my japanese car  
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars  
A message came back from the great beyond  
There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires  
We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs  
All I got was a note that said "" bye-bye john  
Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on""  
  
So I bought A. 44 magnum it was solid steel cast  
And in the blessed name of elvis well I just let it blast  
'til my tv lay in pieces there at my feet  
And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace

Set my flesh to burning,  
Whilst I sleep

Till my soul burn black  
Black rains fall,

Get down Mama, get down low  
They gonna know me

Make me guitar outta skin  
And human skull

In the sandy loam  
Bring you baby  
Out'cha your happy home

It was the middle of June, me and my grand mama  
Had some free time, flew to Panama  
I was playin' the bar, sippin' a Margarita  
When this chick from Argentina, her name Armenita  
She told me you could make some fast cash  
You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name  
Take me to your domain  
Trick, you must be out yo' brain  
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine  
And you could have some if you get me on your plane  
I said here the dealie, you sound silly  
Think hard, there gotta be another way to get you a green card  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
Rosalie you don't know who I suppose to be  
But whatever you wanna be? You can come go wit' me  
Her last thoughts thinking I'mma get her a passport  
Whatever you need ma, just ask for it  
Now she lunch meat, she look at J like she home free  
  
J, can you really get me in your country?  
  
No lie, I can do whatever I mo' tie, so fly  
Mami started offering me chochas  
Certainly the way she flirt wit' me  
If I get her in the US she work for free  
Though she nice to me, I'm runnin' twice the G  
For the right price, she could be a wife to me  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?

But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby  
  
I got a girl out in Asia, name Malaysia  
Who was a real bad chick that owns a Bodega  
She wanted me to save her and make her life greater  
Cuz her dad hates her and rapes her  
She tried to get some paper  
When you wanna leave, I'mma take ya  
In fact, pack ya things, I got a crib in Jamaica  
Mami, mi casa a su casa  
We could do the salsa so, que pasa?  
She said she had money but it was all in trust funds  
But I could get a lump sum if I can get her through customs  
So bring the cake, we gon' swing outta state  
I'mma make you dream when you awake  
Yo Loon, sing the break, what  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
In the middle of Nicaragua, met a mami named Talia  
Weren't plain, then I caught a boat wit' this dumb dame  
An immigrant, marry her, make her legitimate  
Illiterate, mess wit' Hud, she don't consider it  
She said pa, llevame contigo  
Lean dough and I'mma pay yo' peoples  
This retard chick started looking at me hard  
She gassed up thinkin' I'mma get her a green card  
And she don't know that she ain't coming wit' me  
And I don't stuck up for some hundreds of G's  
And while I see her standing there lookin' around  
Huddy took the money, slid outta town, what? uh?  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby  
  
I mean this

Bruce Springsteen,Adam Raised A Cain,/b/bruce+springsteen/adam+raised+a+cain_20025095.html,"In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side  
As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried  
We were prisoners of love a love in chains  
He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain  
With the same hot blood burning in our veins  
Adam raised a Cain  
All of the old faces ask you why you're back  
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac  
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name  
You remember the faces the places the names  
You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain  
Adam raised a Cain  
  
In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast  
You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past  
  
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain  
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame  
You inherit the sins you inherit the flames  
Adam raised a Cain  
Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream

Bruce Springsteen,Black Cowboys,/b/bruce+springsteen/black+cowboys_10051583.html,"Rainey Williams' playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths, names and photos of young black faces,
whose death and blood consecrated these places. Rainey's mother said, ""Rainey
stay at my side, for you are my blessing you are my pride. It's your love here
that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay
inside.""  
  
Rainey'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday. Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Rainey always had his mother's
smile to depend on. Along a street of stray bullets he made his way, to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day.  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of dry
bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains, in Lynette's bedroom he
slept.  
  
Then she got lost in the days. The smile Rainey depended on dusted away, the
arms that held him were no more his home. He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones.  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side, stood in the
dark at his mother's bed, brushed her hair and kissed her eyes.  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone. Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept, as he lay his head back on the seat and slept. He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green, corn and cotton and an
endless nothin' in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone.

They say you got to stay hungry hey baby I'm just about starving tonight  
I'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write  
This book  
I need a love reaction come on baby give me just one look  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, sittin' 'round cryin' over a broken heart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
You can't start a fire, worryin' about your little world falling apart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Bruce Springsteen,Devil's Arcade,/b/bruce+springsteen/devils+arcade_20454263.html,"Remember the morning we dug up your gun  
The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun  
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin  
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in  
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name  
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade  
  
You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""  
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid  
The cool desert morning and nothing to save  
Just metal and plastic where your body caved  
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray  
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name  
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade  
  
You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James  
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin  
  
Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here  
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""  
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave  
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face  
  
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave  
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith  
On a morning to order a breakfast to make  
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits  
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day  
  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart  
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away  
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade  
  
[Terri's Song Begins]  
  
Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the
seas  
They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if
they please  
Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose  
But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun  
And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one  
The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe  
And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold  
When they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong  
'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone  
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold  
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth  
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and
cursed  
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told  
And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold  
  
That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold  
When they built you, brother

Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive  
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?  
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive  
You could laugh and cry in a single sound  
  
And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds  
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?  
  
You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach  
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach  
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek  
That ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech  
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way  
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way  
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar  
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore  
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for  
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for  
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor  
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors  
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?  
And you should know that's true

He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter""

And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day

And hair slicked sweet  
Silver star studs on my duds  
Like a Harley in heat

A destination that can never be reached,

A woman cried from the roadside ""oh he's gone, he's gone""  
They found him slumped up against the drain  
With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins  
Bye bye johnny  
Johnny bye bye  
You didn't have to die  
You didn't have to die

I smoked my last cigarette  
I stay only to get by  
The night was dark and the land was cold  
I was frozen right to the bone

Five hundred miles I have gone today  
Tomorrow it's five hundred more  
Outside my window the world passes by  
Its stranger than a dream

I go to work and I earn my pay, lord

I see you now but we may never meet again child

And some kid comes blastin' 'round the corner, but a cop puts him right away  
He lays on the street holding his leg, screaming something in Spanish, still

And somebody said, ""Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with
such a beautiful thud""

I got a rabbit in the hat  
If you wanna come and see  
This is what will be  
This is what will be  
  
I got shackles on my wrists  
Soon I'll slip and I'll be gone  
Chain me in a box in the river  
And rising in the sun  
  
Trust none of what you hear  
And less of what you see  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be  
  
(I'll cut you in half)  
  
I got a shiny saw blade (a shiny saw blade)  
All I need's a volunteer  
I'll cut you in half  
While you're smilin' ear to ear  
  
And the freedom that you sought  
Driftin' like a ghost amongst the trees  
This is what will be  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
  
Now there's a fire down below  
But it's coming up here  
So leave everything you know  
Carry only what you fear  
  
On the road the sun is sinkin' low  
Bodies hanging in the trees  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be

Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand  
Dreaming of his record in number-one spot

On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel  
Steel gates that completely surround, sir,  
The mansion on the hill  
  
At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride  
Through the streets of a town so silent and still  
Park on a back road along the highway side  
Look up at that mansion on the hill  
  
In the summer all the lights would shine  
There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time  
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields  
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill  
There's a beautiful full moon rising

She give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon  
One sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room

Siftin' through the dust for fools gold, lookin' for a sign

You were drifting down and you couldn't get back  
You were lost and in trouble so far from home  
I reached for you, my arms went to stone  
I woke and you were missing

I searched for something to explain  
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves  
Tell me baby where did you go  
You were here just a moment ago  
  
There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall  
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall  
Your smell drifts through our bedroom  
I wake, but I don't move

Go in your pocket pull out your wallet  
And put it in the air and sing  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen  
Oh every time I close my eyes I see my name in shining lights  
A different city every night all right  
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad!

But it's making you  
Feel this should be.

All it takes is a shot for me to blow it all away.  
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time, It's gonna be with you and no
one else.

Bruno Mars,Love,/b/bruno+mars/love_20911213.html,"Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is. But I'm a tell
you what true love is. Love is not what you see in the movies. It's not the
ecstasy it's not what you see in that scene you know what I mean? I'm telling
you right now true love is sacrifice. Love is thinking about others before you
think about yourself love is selfless not selfish. Love is God and God is
love. Love is when you lay down your life for another whether for your brother
your mother your father or your sister it's even laying down your life for
your enemies that's unthinkable but think about that. Love is true. Think.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
Love is patient love is kind. It does not envy it does not boast it is not
proud. It is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps
no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the
truth. It always protects always trusts always hopes it always perseveres.  
Love never fails. Love is everlasting it's eternal it goes on and on it goes
beyond time love is the only thing that will last when you die but ask the
question why? Do you have love?  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
There is no greater love than this than he who lays down his life for his
friends. Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends? You're
probably willing to lay down your life for your mother your father or your
best friends but are you willing to lay down your life for even those that
hate you? I'm going to tell you who did that the definition of love is Jesus
Christ. He is love. The nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a
cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still
hated him that is love. God is true love and if you don't know this love now
is the time to know perfect love.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love

See you down there everyday  
Trying to find a different way  
To build some kind of latter to the sky  
  
Trying to find some way to see  
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once  
And you don't know why  
  
Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name  
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart  
See you when you cry yourself to sleep  
It's tearing me apart  
  
I know you wish you could see me  
That's the way it has to be  
Someday you'll understand,  
Don't you lose your faith in me  
  
I know you wish you could hear me  
Sometimes it's so hard to do  
But every morning sunrise it says  
I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
  
I know that you're waiting for,  
A chance to come in from the war  
If only a moment, if only a day  
  
A place where you feel safe and warm  
A sanctuary from the storm  
Until all of these questions fade away  
  
But I cannot count on all the signs  
You've passed away as mere coincidence  
And I'm running out of ways to break through  
Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean  
I'll never give up on you

He thought me everything I know  
And 'till this day it shows

To never say I can't

Right before he passed  
Was to never say you can't

And she says she can't imagine  
What on earth I'm waiting for  
I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are  
But I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now I'm writing you this letter  
And it's killing me tonight  
That I agreed when you believed  
It wasn't right  
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed  
So I'm down here on the floor  
Where I'm not supposed to love you anymore

I know I must have took you for granted  
Didn't want to make room for someone else  
Didn't know love when I had it  
You were the one who set me free  
But you can lay the blame on me  
Come my way and you'll see  
I have changed  
  
Calling your name in the quiet of the night  
Seeing your face every time I close my eyes  
It's always the same  
I keep hoping that you might  
  
Look at me now  
Standing here holding my heart in my hands  
Look at me now  
Wishing I'd told you we could still start again

And what did I ever do to deserve you?

You reach for something high but it's a mountain that you find  
He's a king dust demon with an icepick smile  
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly  
  
With the mustache man on the carpet of his van  
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands  
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls  
His horn-rimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls

He is racing, he is pacing, he is sleeping on his beat

You can feel the oceans rising as you're losing all control  
  
And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge  
It is past 11: 30 and your friends are getting down  
They're applying purple eyeshadow, drinking warm beer  
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here

Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes""  
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians  
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits

The sounds of the waves on the stones

Didn't I try, didn't I cry  
Didn't I?  
  
Sorry that your mother dropped you on your head  
Maybe her mother dropped her too  
In the end we all get dropped  
We all get black and blue  
  
But didn't I always love you long  
When time was short and the night was cold  
Didn't I admit that I was wrong  
When the anger was new but the fight was old  
Didn't I say didn't I  
'Till didn't we say we're through

Didn't I, didn't I,

I thought that they must know each other well  
For the magic that they made, when they played  
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell

And God came down to earth and slipped away  
I pretended not to notice I'd been abandoned  
But no-one sang the night into the day  
And later night time songs came back again  
But the singers don't compare with those I knew  
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went

But I get along without you very well

Of course I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someone's laugh that is just the same  
But I've forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool I am  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
What's in store  
Should I phone once more  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except perhaps in Spring  
But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two

I flirt with the notion of no more songs  
My old familiar foe, self pity, haunts me  
I'm stuck in some over-the-mountain town  
In a meaningless bar where fat hands  
Round the steiners  
And no one cares if it suns or pours  
In an hour between trains  
Barney puts the record on  
And the aimless rise to dance  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
I see you, George, in your  
Apartment on Riverside Drive  
Some fifty years ago  
Your fingers on the keys  
Looking for the song  
Looking for that hook  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
Who were you then?  
Did you have a woman?  
Were you hard up for cash?  
Did you ever know you'd be heard in  
The middle distance  
In some over-the-mountain town?  
Connecting to the muscles of the dancers  
In this close and smoky room  
  
Who were you then?  
Were you sure of your tune?  
Or were your dreams and your courage all broken down like mine?  
Now there's something that clutches the heart  
A melody that stays  
  
Year after year  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all I want my arms around you  
I'm already late for my train  
But I don't think about that  
I think of you, George  
At your piano, sweating in the summer heat  
  
By the way, did you get your girl,  
Did you by your house in the country?  
Did you wait for something that never came?  
Did you die still waiting for your train?  
Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama  
Come to mama do  
  
Some part of your heart twists and turns in mine  
Your soul rises  
There's an angel in charge  
There's one note that weeps the truth  
And makes my life mean something  
Just for the length of  
  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Come to mama do

I will catch the train  
Catch another breath

To think that spring had depended  
On merely this, a look, a kiss  
To think that something so splendid  
Could slip away in one little daybreak  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung,  
When we were young last night  
  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung,

Footsteps that you hear down the hall  
The laugh that floats on a summer's night  
That you might never quite recall  
And you see Laura on a train  
That is passing through  
Those eyes how familiar they seem  
She gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura but she's only a dream

Some kind of leader some day""

""This isn't exactly what we had planned""

A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.  
  
And though I know you  
Still have the heart of that small boy  
Well, you lend it out far too much  
And no one woman loving you  
Can ever feel that she's been really touched.

But the valley was infected, by a different kind of beauty  
And the Indians they knew, it was a devil's sanctuary.  
  
Out of this unholy dawn, a car came stirring up the sand  
And a woman from a passion play  
Held up the limousine that brought me  
All this way today. And I didn't need to turn around  
So strong was the message, and the man who planned her life  
Commanded all that followed: Well they bellowed, and they hollered  
And they threw each other down, down in this valley  
This cruel and lovely valley, Oh it should have been an alley  
In some low down part of town  
  
As the lights came up, there was no sun  
And brandy splattered all over the ground  
As this woman with her head held high  
Yelled love and why oh why, you're killing me oh follow me-  
As I watched safe and clean, from the frosted windows of that limousine  
  
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down  
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley  
Oh it should have been an alley, in some low down part of town  
  
Before he'd been so funny, imagining the best:  
That he'd escape recrimination, for abandoning the nest  
He'd been joking and stoned, while he was entertaining me  
But then turned and was stunned, by her panic and her misery  
  
And I was in the get-away car  
Giving him a chance, to get away  
Get away, get away  
  
And how the valley smoked, as he crossed Route 25  
With his cymbals and his shattered crown, leaving all alone  
His eyes fixed on the ground. And he didn't even turn around  
So strong was the message, and he fell into the shallow sky  
And was swallowed.  
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down  
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley  
Well it should have been an alley, In some low down part of town

Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
In the name of honesty, in the name of what is fair

""I don't mind working Saturdays""  
""When you wanna work I'll work with you"", she say  
""And I'll go on working when you wanna play""  
""Nothing gonna hurt you when I'm around""  
""I'll keep my eyes wide open and my nose to the ground""

You're locked in too tight on the same team  
There's a little holiday in her heart  
When she sees you slip up, Ah  
It's like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up  
Ooops, then down again  
She'll sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin  
When her tears spill out, crocodile chagrin  
It's her contempt for you, she thinks you're a slob

Greatest cook to bring a meal (didn't need a recipe)  
Said she'll also deal the cards (dealt the knave and two and three)  
Said she also feel the thrill of the willow in the wind  
(Feel the thrillo the willow, or oak or elm or ash or pine sol)  
  
It's already too late when she's reading your mail  
Calling your agent and making the deal  
She'll just copy and paste it and make it last  
Nothing is sacred about your past  
  
She'll tell of the poppies in the July fest  
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest  
""You could go to jail, fail all the tests""  
""Forget your keys and your secrets and your little black box""

She was awfully good at fire (fiery fiery hussy burn)  
She burned bridges where she could (she really couldn't burn them very well)  
She turned young men into torches (burning scarecrow)  
She had a way with wood (do away with wood, do away with wood)  
  
People say a lot when they want the job  
Lining up eager around the block  
Promising, promising never to quit  
Well it's a full time job to be a hypocrite  
Maybe they remember that they've done it before  
Practicing, with their dolls on the floor  
The lie itself becoming the seed  
The messy mascara, the future deed  
The actor's bow, the junkie's need  
They line up again just to wipe you clean  
  
They line up again just to wipe you out  
Line up again around the block  
A mighty force of youth for hire  
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh

As he drove away on that rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,  
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!  
  
I felt so helpless, what could I do  
Remembering all the things we'd been through?  
In school they all stop and stare

Gone away is the blue bird  
  
Here to stay is a new bird  
  
He songs a love song  
  
As we go along  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
  
He'll say are you married?  
  
We'll say no man  
  
But you can do the job  
  
While you're in town  
  
  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
  
As we dream by the fire  
  
To face unafraid  
  
The plans that we made  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland

Carpenters,Yesterday Once More,/c/carpenters/yesterday+once+more_20027553.html,"When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waitin' for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile  
  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine  
  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breakin' her heart  
It can really make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.  
  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
(All the oldies but goodies)  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine  
  
All my best memories come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine

Listening to me

You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true  
How could anyone mean more to me than you  
  
Sorry if sometimes i look past you  
There's no one beyond your eyes  
Inside my head wheels are turning  
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise  
You are my heart and my soul my inspiration  
Just like the old love song goes  
  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true

And on this night there'll be no peace

They built our life before us, we had no choice  
The evil that's been done still is carrying on  
And when they're gone we'll be the voice  
  
Blue bird on a rock, slow wind blowing soft  
Across the bare face of the sleeping lake  
Rise up and be free, voice whispered to me  
And in this way you will awake  
  
Go climb up on a hill, stand perfectly still  
And silently soak up the day  
Don't rush and don't you roam, don't feel so alone  
And in this way you will awake  
  
And in this way you will awake  
And this way you will awake  
  
Pick up the pieces you see before you  
Don't let your weaknesses destroy you  
You know wherever you go the world will follow  
So let your reasons be true to you  
  
Stay close to your friends up until the end  
And when they know that you feel the same way  
Rise up and be free and die happily

And what I used to say

Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Oh darling, you see my face  
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place  
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste  
Can you...  
  
Oh love, sweet blue love  
No man can ever get enough  
But maybe one day we'll all die in love  
Will you...oh love, sweet love, my...love  
  
Oh babe, understand  
Take my love that's all I have at hand  
Please say you will...don't say you can't  
Oh will you will you will you

I knew' that I need not look no more  
I've seen many other girls before, ah but darling  
Heaven must've programmed you  
  
The moment you fell inside my dreams  
I realized all I had not seen  
I've seen many other girls before, ah hot darling  
Heaven must've programmed you  
  
You can live in the largest house  
And eleven apartments too  
Run your own private plane  
And a boat in Malibu  
  
But 'till you know' deep down what inside you really need  
Well I love you baby, ooh my dear  
And I think about you sometimes  
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind  
  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on over and find yourself  
Come on now it's freedom calling  
Come on in and remind yourself  
  
Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say  
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away.  
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you were born to
do'?  
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you.  
Love, love boy...  
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night.  
  
Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh  
Cause you've been a saving grace to me  
And I'd hate to face a day without you around  
My life would be without sound  
  
Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday  
Cause you taste to me as good as god made honey taste babe  
And the sky all glistens with gold  
When you're talking to me  
And the whirling wind turns to song  
Why it sets my soul free  
  
Love, love. love. Love must've made you on a Sunday  
There are no words. I can use  
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose  
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning

This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time

Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me  
Is this a Eucharistic dove  
'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear  
But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place  
  
Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel.  
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel  
I made the cabin door, the pilot turned around  
He said we're Venus bound  
Oh please take me home  
After all I'm only human and the Earth is where I belong  
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face  
'Cause as he touched my head I saw myself back in bed

Beneath the dark stream of desires

High above the lives of man  
Weeping rivers  
For thousands of years

To the wonders of this sight  
Like birds in a cage  
Asleep with closed wings

The wars of the world

Yet how many times he's tried  
Himself to immortalize  
Like his parents before him  
In the garden of Eden

I want to talk it out with you  
Try to get my message through  
That's not all i want to do  
Later

I saw a face, a face in the moonstone,  
And then it started to disappear  
  
Well, I walked and walked and never talked  
For many days,  
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place.

When something told me that I had to see it again.

Midnight come, colors are melting  
White moon shivering on the sea

Wax Queen will carry me  
I can see the forest for miles  
All the creatures small and large  
If you crumble I won't be living  
For my love would have no house  
  
Mountain, oh mighty mountain  
Show me secrets you have  
So I may become brother to Moses  
And live, live and be glad  
I can feel all of your powers  
Growing lighter in the dark  
If you crumble I won't be living  
For my love would have no heart  
  
White moon, white as my skeleton  
Who has seen martyrs among my brothers  
Yet strength remained in me to write the song  
Say no more! The children already know  
And their dreams grow strong like the trees  
In their minds where thoughts are plotted  
Is also where crystal suns are forged  
  
And they will be older than a thousand years  
So that they may open the deserts of the heart  
And in these dreams of the mountain  
Friendship will surface

Lingering just above my head

Why was I born ""The Nine""  
Cursed repeatedly  
Who would know if I should die.  
  
No one needed me  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
Cold and silent was the house my name was on  
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one  
  
S'dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
All at once my bones began to change  
I was tall and young again,  
Sweet as rain falling on the snow  
Who, who, who, who?  
Who is he, who am I, and  
What laid in between?  
  
How can I say goodbye? No one let me in  
Can't see no need for Nine no more  
Now it's too late to open the door.

I left my folk and friends  
With the aim to clear my mind out  
  
Well I hit the rowdy road  
And many kinds I met there  
And many stories told me on the way to get there  
  
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out  
  
In the end I'll know  
But on the way I wonder  
Through descending snow  
And through the frost and thunder  
  
I listen to the wind come howl  
Telling me I have to hurry  
I listen to the robin's song  
Saying not to worry  
  
So on, and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out  
  
Well I found myself alone  
Hoping someone would miss me  
Thinking about my home and the last woman to kiss me  
  
Well sometimes you have to moan  
When nothing seems to suit you  
But never the less you know  
Your locked towards the future  
  
So off and on you go, the seconds tick the time out  
There's so much left to know and I'm on the road to find out  
  
And I found my head one day  
When I wasn't even trying  
And here I have to say  
Cause there is no use in lying, lying  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup, pickup a good book now
