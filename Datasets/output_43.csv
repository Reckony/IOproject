Lloyd Cole,Chelsea Hotel,/l/lloyd+cole/chelsea+hotel_20084759.html,"I remember you well in the chelsea hotel,  
You were talking so brave and so sweet,  
Giving me head on the unmade bed,  
While the limousines wait in the street.  
Those were the reasons and that was new york,  
We were running for the money and the flesh.  
And that was called love for the workers in song  
Probably still is for those of them left.  
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,  
You just turned your back on the crowd,  
You got away, I never once heard you say,  
I need you, I don't need you,  
I need you, I don't need you  
And all of that jiving around.  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
You were famous, your heart was a legend.  
You told me again you preferred handsome men  
But for me you would make an exception.  
And clenching your fist for the ones like us  
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,  
You fixed yourself, you said, ""well never mind,  
We are ugly but we have the music.""  
And then you got away, didn't you babe...  
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,  
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel,  
That's all, I don't even think of you that often.

Lloyd Cole,Don't Look Back,/l/lloyd+cole/dont+look+back_20084710.html,"When you're nothing to no one  
And you're less than you can  
And you're looking for someone  
Who won't cling to anything  
So you're stuck in some motel  
With the sound of her sleeping  
Don't you feel kinda old now  
Well ain't that a funny thing  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
So you're back on the highway  
And there's wind in her hair  
And you know that it's no time for thinking  
About somebody up there  
'Cause you'll turn her to drinking  
And you'll lead her to hell  
With her bottle beside her  
She surely looks like an angel  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But faith is never easy  
When you're young  
No no no  
I used to wake up early  
Now it's hard, hard enough to sleep  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
Oh no no no no

Fleeing what a loss  
  
The things he hadn't touched or kissed his senses  
Slowly stripped away  
Not like Buddha not like Vishnu  
Life wouldn't rise through him again  
  
I find it easy to believe  
That he might question his beliefs  
The beginning of the Last Temptation

The duality of nature, Godly nature,  
Human nature splits the soul  
Fully human, fully divine and divided  
The great immortal soul  
  
Split into pieces, whirling pieces, opposites  
Attract  
From the front, the side, the back  
The mind itself attacks  
  
I know the feeling, I know it from before  
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure

The Mysteries of Life  
Outside the city shrieking screaming whispering  
The Mysteries of Life  
  
There's a funeral tomorrow  
At St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you  
Ah, what must you have been thinking  
When you realized the time had come for you  
  
I wish I hadn't thrown away my time  
On so much Human and so much less Divine

How can he tell a good act from the bad  
He can't even remember his name  
How can he do what needs to be done  
When he's a follower not a leader  
  
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl  
Leaving her small and helpless  
Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun  
Leaving her running in circles  
  
How can she tell a good act from the bad  
When she's flat on her back in her room  
How can she do what needs to be done  
When she's a coward and a bleeder  
  
The man if he marries will batter his child  
And have endless excuses  
The woman sadly will do much the same  
Thinking that it's right and it's proper  
  
Better than their mommy or their daddy did  
Better than the childhood they suffered  
The truth is they're happier when they're in pain  
In fact, that's why they got married

Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail  
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles

They're stabbing each other in the dark  
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks

Two rented feelings sitting in the stands  
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for  
All of a sudden it comes back to me  
  
Just up ahead is the finish line  
Two rented referees and two checkered rags  
Out of the corner of my eye comes a  
Dark horse with black wings  
Headed for the finish line

I thought I'd see you next week  
I say over and over if I had half a brain  
If I had half a brain in my head  
I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number  
And listening to what some recording said  
I knew I should have written, written things down  
I always say I'll never forget  
Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?  
Who's a concert pianist?  
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme  
My friends are blending in my head  
They're melting into one great spirit  
And that spirit isn't dead  
Now, I may not remember everything that you said  
But I remember all the sings you've done  
And not a day goes by, not an hour  
When I don't try to be like you  
You were gassed, stoked, and rarin' to go  
And you were that way all the time  
So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves  
Every time I dial the wrong line  
This is no longer a working number, baby

His was a greatness to behold  
He was the last surviving progeny  
The last one on this side of the world  
He measured half a mile from tip to tail  
silver and black with powerful fins  
They say he could split a mountain in two  
That's how we got the Grand Canyon  
Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes  
Some say they saw him off the coast of Florida  
My mother said she saw him in Chinatown  
but you can't always trust your mother.  
Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day  
The lighthouse glows ghostly there are night  
The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayor's son  
and he'd been on death row since 1958  
The mayor's kid was a rowdy pig  
spit on Indians and lots worse  
The old chief buried a hatchet in his head  
life compared to death for him seemed worse  
The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing  
and tried to conjure up a storm or rain  
The harbor parted and the great whale sprang full up  
and caused a huge tidal wave  
The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief  
The tribe let out a roar  
The whites were drowned  
the browns and reds set free  
but sadly one thing more  
Some local yokel member of the NRA  
kept a bazooka in his living room  
and thinking he had the chief in his sights  
blew the whale's brains out with a lead harpoon  
Well Americans don't care for much of anything  
land and water the least  
And animal life is low on the totem pole  
with human life not worth much more than infected yeast  
Americans don't care too much for beauty  
They'll shit in a river, dump battery acid in a stream  
They'll watch dead rats wash up on the beach  
and complain if they can't swim  
They say things are done for the majority  
Don't believe half of what you see  
and none of what you hear  
It's a lot like what my painter friend Donald said to me  
""Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they're done""

At 5 am the moon and the sun sit set before my window  
Light glances off the blue glass we set right before the window  
And you who accept in your soul and your head  
What was misunderstood what was thought of with dread  
A new self is born the other self dead  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
A soul singer stands on the stage the spotlight shows him sweating  
He sinks to one knee Seems to cry the horn are unrelenting  
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard  
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large  
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

As the chromium moon it sets  
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling

Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner

Louis Armstrong,Cabaret,/l/louis+armstrong/cabaret_20085329.html,"What good is sitting, alone in your room?  
But come, hear the music play!

Come to the cabaret!  
Put down your knitting, your book and your broom

To wipe every smile away  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
So come to the cabaret!  
  
I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie  
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea  
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower  
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours  
The day she died the neighbours  
Came to snicker her  
Well, that is what comes from  
Too much pills and liquor  
  
But when I saw her laid down like a queen  
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen  
I think of Elsie till this very day  
I remember how she'd turned to me and say  
What good is sitting all alone in your room?  
Come hear the music play  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
Come to the cabaret!  
  
And as for me  
And as for me  
I made my mind up back in Chelsea  
When I go I am going like Elsie

From cradle to doom

It's only a cabaret, old chum!

Louis Armstrong,Cain And Abel,/l/louis+armstrong/cain+and+abel_21073721.html,"Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel?  
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town.  
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel,  
So he rose up and smote Abel down.  
  
Now the Lord sure was hopping mad,  
And yet he was plenty sad,  
to think that he had a man like Cain.  
  
The Lord spoke and showed his wrath,  
And Cain walked the path  
That led to a life full of pain.  
  
You can't run from the shadow of retribution.  
If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs.  
Let yourself take a lesson from Cain and Able:  
  
Don't lament, be content,  
Don't resent what the Lord has sent,  
And you'll find that you're bound to get along.

And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce  
  
In High, High So-,  
High So-ci-,

begins tomorrow a brand-new life.

Since i don't remember when  
It's been a long....been a mighty long time  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I've dreamed about you  
Or how empty they all seem without you  
So kiss me once...and kiss me twice  
And kiss me once again  
It's been a long...long time

To share your happiness

Through the doorway of Heaven  
I'm drifting high on a cloud

Your lips divine combined with mine  
And dream forever more

That I always found it best  
Instead of getting 'em off my chest  
To let 'em rest unexpressed  
  
I hate parading, serenading  
As I'll probably miss the bar  
But if this ditty is not so pretty  
At least it'll tell you how great you are  
  
You're the tops  
You're the Colosseum  
You're the top  
You're the Louvre Museum  
  
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss  
You're a Bendel bonnet  
A Shakespeare's sonnet  
You're Mickey Mouse  
  
You're the Nile  
You're the Tower of Pisa  
Mama, you're the smile  
On the Mona Lisa  
  
I'm a worthless check  
A total wreck, a flop  
But if, baby, I'm the bottom  
You're the top  
  
You're the top  
You're Mahatma Gandhi  
You're the top  
You're Napoleon Brandy  
  
You're the purple light  
Of a summer night in Spain  
You're the National Gallery  
You're Crosby's salary  
You're cellophane  
  
Mama you're sublime  
You're a turkey dinner  
Oh, you're the time of a Derby winner  
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop

You're the top

Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.  
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just get it.  
Be careful O!! Oh!! Oh!!

You can choose your friend, but you cannot  
Choose, who you related to.  
  
He goes up to his room, he's not feeling good today  
But it's no use, telling, nobody listens here  
No use complaining, nobody cares around here  
Little boys go to sleep and pray  
For toys and candy, he prays for one thing  
God I need a miracle down here  
Will you make, Mommy and Daddy?  
Disappear forever  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just, get it.  
Be careful Oh!! Oh!! Oh!!

No one will undermine my culture anymore,

Just what my mama said  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he  
Would be gone from me  
  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step  
One final dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end

Dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door

I see that you're open  
And that you wanna feel much more  
Well, I'm truly certain  
That my love will open the door  
To feelings to love  
And happiness  
To a life filled with wonder  
Never second guess  
That I want you and I love you  
Never wanted more  
You the one that I need  
And the one that I adore

We spend most of the time chasing that dough  
  
But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly  
Call your momma, tell her come over

Steppin' out with you

Don't even peek at your pager now  
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool  
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow  
We're in a club full of people  
But it feels just like me and you

Catching everybody's eye

Duet with Dionne Warwick  
  
Here we are so close to the end now  
Still holding on we try and pretend now  
Clinging to love we both know is dying  
We've tried and tried to find us a way out  
But darling our dreams have now all been played out  
Still we go on hopelessly trying  
  
Chorus:  
But how many times can we say goodbye  
Hos many times can we see love die  
How many times can we give it one more try  
Before we really say goodbye  
  
We're so in love but wrong for each other  
Each hurt that heals brings on another  
Both of us used and both of us using  
Darling it's time that we stop pretending  
There's just no way to rewrite our ending  
We're caught in this game  
And we know we're both losing  
  
Repeat Chorus

Both of our hearts refusing to wake up  
Just can't go on and on living a lie

Well I try because I like to finish what I start  
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow  
But it won't if you keep treating me

You're so confident that I'd never leave you

'cause a fly kind of guy like me  
Surely deserves more, much more  
My new love can see what's inside of me  
And she told me to thank you  
For the good love that you blew, and oh  
  
I wish you could see the way she looks at me  
She don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly  
She don't hide me from her friends when we have company  
And she never ever makes me feel

And after we lay here, she wants me to stay here  
I'm not just for making love then expected to leave  
I'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet

And feel the fire of the power of love  
  
Did you know that your feelings show  
You thought your love was locked up inside  
But when your senses start to overload  
Love is something you should never hide  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone to try  
I promise you'll reach the sky  
One thing that we can't deny  
Is the power of love  
  
So close your eyes and you can feel it  
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love  
You can't deny it, so don't even try it  
Let the feelin' sweep you off your feet  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone you see  
How much better the world could be  
For them and for you, for me  
With the power of love  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
My-my-my-my-my-my  
You've got to feel the power  
Yeah, yeah  
  
So listen up and you will hear it  
A symphony from above, it's the power of love  
So glad we've found it, now there's no way around it  
Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone to try  
I promise you'll reach the sky  
One thing that you can't deny  
Is the power of love  
  
When we walk down the street  
We don't care who we see or who we meet  
Don't need to run, don't need to hide  
'Cause we've got something burning inside, yeah  
  
We've got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all, ooh...ooh...  
We've got love power  
And together we can't fall, sing it with  
  
We've got love (Love) power (Power)

No love to shield me  
Trapped in a world that's  
A distorted reality.  
  
Happiness you took from me  
And left me alone  
With only memories.

Cause although you're gone  
I keep holding on  
To the happy times

Of lost time  
Looking over my yesteryear  
And all this love I gave all in vain

(all those tears) All the tears that I've tasted

Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt  
That you have caused  
  
Everywhere I turn  
Seems like everything I see  
Reflects the love that used to be  
In you I put all my faith and trust  
And right before my eyes my world has turned to dust  
  
After all those nights I sat alone and wept  
Just a hand full of promises and all that's left of loving you

The love you took from me

Luther Vandross,Right In The Middle,/l/luther+vandross/right+in+the+middle_10168628.html,"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff  
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice  
And believe me when I tell you  
  
This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life  
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)  
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)  
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)  
  
So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness  
Right in the middle  
Perfect love sounds real nice  
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  
It was always up and down, in then out  
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about  
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time  
  
And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night  
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)  
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)  
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)  
  
It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the
groove  
Right in the middle  
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality  
That's why they say ""Que sera, sera""  
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be  
  
Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:  
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)  
Not all sunshine, not all rain  
(You know that too much of a good thing is really no good)  
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)

Cause I had the chance to tell you what you meant  
But I lived my life thinking I had time  
And that in my mind I'd get to it  
  
Now you've gone away, not a single day goes by  
When I don't think about it  
Your spirit's all around, I can say it now  
I hope you hear this  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
So oh, I've got to tell everybody  
Don't make the same mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
It's alright to say I love you out loud  
And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside  
Let it out, do it today  
No no no, don't you wait  
Cause it just might be too late  
To say I love you  
  
Don't walk a mile inside my shoes  
Cause if you do, you're gonna regret it  
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be  
Here or there tomorrow  
  
Why you want to wait, communicate  
Don't assume that they already know  
How much, how much you're really feeling  
And you really, really love them  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
It's like I would tell anybody  
Don't make the same mistake like I did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Those three words make all the difference in the world  
You might wait and miss your chance  
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling  
You can't turn back the hands of time  
If you get the chance, do it right  
Let it out, say it now  
Say it

I'm ready  
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud  
So ready  
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now  
But I waited too late  
So today I won't make the same mistake, no  
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it

She blush a little bit

Ring the girl on her private line

Go to work early, come back late  
Outta my head, can't concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
She's better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind

This is one night that I'll never forget  
You see, it was just like in the movies  
I mean, it actually happened just like this...  
  
The stars were shining brighter than most of the time  
Then love came out of nowhere  
  
No thrill will ever be like  
(The night that I fell in love)  
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night

The stars' lights were in your eyes

See, I've prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you

Fell out of my bed  
Worn out, I couldn't sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be?  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time I'll  
Make it work somehow  
Guess I'm gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And it's love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Can't pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
I'm not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around, I know  
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again

It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me

We get by on the high of love  
And there's no time to spend on doubt or wondering  
'Cause no one else could I ever love  
You see the world outside can be cold and very lonely  
And it gets real bad  
And it makes me sad, but  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
We all live in a crazy world today  
There's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain  
And we'd be wiser to make a change, with love we could  
It's our world, we should make it good  
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely  
And it gets real bad  
It'll still make us sad  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
Our love is out world  
And it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us  
We look out from inside  
And depending on what we see  
We just hold each other tightly, hold me tightly  
'Cause sometimes it's just better to let it be  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die

Jake is out to get some revenge  
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died  
Shot down by a so-called friend  
  
For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say  
Drugs had control of his life  
Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back  
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes  
It's a killer  
  
There's a cold house at the corner of the street  
The kids come and go there at night  
Jerry drove up in front of the house  
Somebody pulled out a knife  
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun  
Shot him right between the eyes  
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high  
But now he's locked up for the rest of his life

So don't you never, never give in  
It's a killer  
  
The neighborhood I used to call home  
These days it's lookin' like a war zone  
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives  
Money just keeps changin' hands  
The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough  
To satisfy supply and demand  
  
Trouble breaks out there's fightin' in the streets  
Bullets flyin' all around  
An innocent child caught in the line of fire  
All because there weren't enough drugs to go around

It was the needle and the spoon  
And a trip to the moon  
Took me away  
Took me away  
  
I've been feeling so sick inside  
Got to get better, Lord, before I die  
Some doctors couldn't help my head, they said  
You'd better quit, son, before you're dead  
  
Quit the needle, quit the spoon  
Quit the trip to the moon  
They gonna take you away  
Lord, they gonna take you away  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
  
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool  
But then again, Lord, I've seen a lot of fools  
I hope you people, Lord, can hear what I say  
You'll have your chance to hit it some day  
  
Don't mess with a needle or a spoon  
Or a trip to the moon  
They'll take you away  
  
Lord, their gonna bury you boy  
Don't mess with the needle

And can music save your mortal soul  
And can it teach me how to dance real slow

With a great carnation and a pick up truck

But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
Well now in the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed

The church bells all broken  
And the three men I admire the most,  
The father, son, and the holy ghost  
They caught the last train for the coast

It couldn't get worse  
You're buildin' my coffin  
You're drivin' the hearse  
I thought it was you  
I loved you the most  
But I was just keepin'  
My enemies close  
I made a decision I had to employ  
So how did you end up with all of my toys  
  
I'm not your brother, not your lover  
And I'm not your friend  
Now that it's over you're another  
Kind of different  
A new person  
Your time is up  
And that's my blood in your dixie cup

You had a way  
Of seeing through my thoughts  
  
It's so confusing I thought I met my match  
An intellectual would telling for a catch  
You always said we be better off as friends  
It was inevitable that it would end  
  
Your picture's off my wall  
But I'm still waiting for your call  
And every man that walks through that door  
Will be compared to you forever more

I cannot lie and I won't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
I miss the country side where we used to lay  
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day  
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit  
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it  
  
You wrote me poetry  
You had a way with words  
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl  
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much  
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Saved the best ones that I have

The city is our playground tonight  
We're gonna be like gangsters tonight  
We don't give a damn if it's wrong or right  
Lighten up, we won't have no regrets

Lose your self-control, we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
We don't have to speak that much  
I hear you when I feel your touch  
Whisper in my ears, make me blush  
Feel the chill as we kiss, don't forget  
  
All you had as dreams, don't hold back  
All the fantasies you ever had  
Just do what you like, go ahead  
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets  
  
I'll make this the best night of your life

I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
Surrender to the pleasure (wanting)  
When we breath in together (waiting)  
It's either now or never (for you)  
This feeling will take over  
  
No sex tapes, no camera (wanting)

I'm not gonna let you go and run around  
I need to know that you'll be true to me  
'Cause that's the way it's got to be  
  
Why can't you give your promise to me  
Is love so blind that you cannot see  
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door  
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more

Each time you break my heart  
I try to put my pride aside  
Each time you break my heart  
A little voice inside me cries  
  
No matter what you do or say  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway  
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind  
How come you can't just walk away  
  
In the beginning we were nothing but glad  
Those were the best days that we ever had  
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone  
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on

I know you're hurting inside

But she won't always answer the phone

It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female  
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same

You've completed your task

One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
You're scented, you'll be sent

Someone has altered the rules

A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents  
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint  
You were just a backstreet girl  
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting  
  
High flying, adored  
Did you believe in your wildest moments  
All this would be yours  
That you'd become the lady of them all?  
  
Were there stars in your eyes  
When you crawled in at night  
From the bars, from the sidewalks  
From the gutter theatrical  
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall  
  
High flying, adored  
What happens now, where do you go from here?  
For someone on top of the world  
The view is not exactly clear  
A shame you did it all at twenty-six  
There are no mysteries now  
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you  
  
High flying, adored  
I hope you come to terms with boredom  
So famous so easily, so soon  
It's not the wisest thing to be  
  
You won't care if they love you  
It's been done before  
You'll despair if they hate you  
You'll be drained of all energy  
All the young who've made it would agree  
  
High flying, adored  
That's good to hear but unimportant  
My story's quite usual  
Local girl makes good, weds famous man  
I was stuck in the right place at the perfect time  
Filled a gap, I was lucky  
But one thing I'll say for me  
No one else can fill it like I can

You're in so much pain  
I blamed you when things didn't go my way

If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear  
If I took another path  
Things would be so different, but they're not

But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream  
I though we were indestructible  
I never imagine we could fall  
You wanna know how to make a laugh  
Telling your plans  
  
We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,  
End it up with walls, It would be so cool,  
Could've gone by the s in the country sides,  
With a back of great things, kissing eye to eye  
  
We could've do the world in a private jet  
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet  
We could've find a mountain in a perfect sun set,  
Writing out names across the sky  
We could've got a building built in the echo run  
We could've got a sales in west and sold out mount  
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die  
Instead I made you cry  
  
I fucked up

Nobody does it better than myself

Everything carries me to you  
As if everything that exists - aromas, light, metals  
Were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me  
  
Well, now  
If little by little you stop loving me  
I shall stop loving you  
Little by little  
If suddenly you forget me  
Do not look for me  
For I shall already have forgotten you  
  
If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life  
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots  
Remember  
That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms  
And my roots will set off to seek another land  
  
But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me  
With implacable sweetness  
If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me  
Ahh my love, ahh my own, in me all that fire is repeated  
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten

Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior  
I'm living with the stranger I used to know so well  
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture  
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?  
  
You hear voices taunting you to leave me  
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms  
You have demons, nothing can control them  
Who can blame you if you're not in charge  
  
Is this life, I think not  
I wanna get off this merry-go-round  
History will complete itself  
And I won't let you break me down  
  
I'd like to get to know you  
You could warm up your hands on my heart  
I've got so much to show you  
But for now it's just Bon D' Accord

I lose a part I can't get back  
I wanna hide  
This is the part where I detach  
Each time they write a hateful word  
Dragging my soul into the dirt  
I wanna die  
Never [?] hurts

Just hold me while I cry my eyes out

But I'm in the dark, yeah  
I can't be superhero right now  
Even hearts made out of steel can break down  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
I'm only human

Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not going down

Words are like weapons, they betray  
When I am afraid  
One word of kindness, it can save me

That I was part of your life  
I say my prayers to the sandman

I remember that my heart does ache

But right now I feel so dead inside  
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued

In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged good-bye  
And it all comes back to me tonight

Oh what a circus, oh what a show  
Argentina has gone to town  
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron  
We've all gone crazy  
Mourning all day and mourning all night  
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right  
  
Oh what an exit, that's how to go  
When they're ringing your curtain down  
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron  
It's quite a sunset  
And good for the country in a roundabout way  
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today  
  
But who is this Santa Evita?  
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?  
What kind of goddess has lived among us?  
How will we ever get by without her?  
  
She had her moments, she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""  
But that's all gone now  
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears  
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva

You let down your people Evita  
You were supposed to have been immortal  
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for  
But in the end you could not deliver  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
And she's not coming back to you  
  
Show business kept us all alive  
Since seventeen October 1945  
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin  
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in  
  
Instead of government we had a stage  
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage  
Instead of help we were given a crowd  
She didn't say much, but she said it loud  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
She's not coming back to you

This day was promised to me  
The Gods are my shield  
My fate has been sealed  
Lightning and javelins fly  
Soon many will fall  
We are storming the wall  
Stones fall snow from the sky  
We will pay with our glory  
In the fire of battle

Killing all in my way  
Like sheep and like cattle  
Smashing skulls of all who defy

I spare not the sword  
This day will ring with my name  
None have to chase me  
Let he who will face me  
Kill me or die by the sword

This was your time, but the armor you  
Wore was mine, I will not rest until  
Hector's blood is spilled  
His bones will all be broken  
Dragged across the field  
This dear friend is how we'll say  
Goodbye, until we meet in the sky  
  
Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods weigh my  
Fate from this day do I abstain, to a memory of  
Hate to pay for all the blood that spilled  
The many thousands I did kill, no walls can  
Contain in the Gods almighty will  
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide  
The Gods leave no choices so we all must die  
Oh Achilles let my arrows fly  
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky  
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand it was  
Foretold I will die by my hand  
Into Hades my soul descends  
  
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me  
As they fall unto their knees  
Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
When the cards of life were dealt  
My hand a ruthless fate  
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate  
A bloodbath I was born to bring, my birth I'm an assassin  
To cut the cord of life and death  
Ties to Earth unfasten  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall the Hades waits  
Kill  
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield  
His body's mangled wounds  
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom  
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction  
I fall upon your bringing death, the Gods give no protection  
Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me, as they fall unto their  
Knees Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits  
Die die die die  
  
The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled  
In the hear of the battle, Hector was killed  
See him Patroclus, down in the dust  
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust  
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed  
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled  
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire  
With oxen , sheep and two of your hounds  
Your funeral Pyre high off the ground  
Hector's body dragged three times around  
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre  
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire  
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body  
Until your body is burned  
A prophecy spoken a promise fulfilled  
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed

He calls my name, and waves me on  
The fallen one he stands in flame  
  
Well the life that he has given full of riches  
And success has a price that I made good in  
Blood to pay. And the light he now is showing  
To guide my every footstep is insurance if  
I falter on my way. And what God has now  
Forsaken and man has never seen are the  
Riches of the underworld below all my  
Years of earthly pleasures gave support  
Unto the bridge I now cross it giving  
Him my soul

Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up on hells

My lustful soul,  
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on  
the horns of death  
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king

His name, across the bridge of  
Death there he stands in flame  
I know the one who waits Satan  
Is his name across the bridge of death  
There he stands in flame.

Without question even walk among the living if

Left for the tide,

Circling lower the vultures fly  
  
These bones may be broken  
But the spirit can't die  
And the Gods see his anguish  
And give him a sign

Where no one sleeps while the undead cry

""Let ye not pass Abaddon, return to the world from whence you came  
And seek payment not only for thine own anguish  
But vindicate the souls of the unavenged""  
  
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called Vengeance  
Forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged  
  
And to carry him on his journey back to the upper world  
They brought forth their demon horse called Black Death  
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in color  
That he could stand as one with the darkness  
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire

Gloves of Metal rule tonight.  
  
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains  
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.  
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.  
Bound by metal we live the fight.  
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
With hands high forever we'll be there,  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight!

Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground  
Rotting flesh, a sacrificial mound  
  
Were you our God or a man in a play  
Who took our applause and forced us to stay  
Now all together we lived as we died  
On your command by your side  
  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
  
In the cult of the damned we all worked the land  
Too afraid to look up we all feared his hand  
Hurry my children there isn't much time  
But we'll meet again on the other side  
Be good to the children and old people first  
Hand them a drink they're dying of thirst

Pulled under water screaming like hell  
He told us life was just a hotel  
Time to check out when he rang the bell

In a single moment

All his words were true  
He lived and died

He paid with his life  
For his life was the price  
To pass the gates immortal  
Thy journey begins  
With sword in the wind  
Stay thy hand rest thy command  
For odin's call was heard above them all  
Thy name shall never die!  
Long shall we remember  
He who walked the road of danger  
Master of revenge  
Death's no stranger  
Blood and death lived on his sword  
The god of war his only lord  
Into the depths of hell  
Go all he fell  
Take thy shield take thy sword  
All thy weapons to the sky  
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise  
For none but the brave  
Shall rise up from the grave  
To see the valkyries fly  
And so it was by the hand of odin  
Did the immortal warrior pass through  
The gates of valhalla and into legend.  
Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates  
Here great warriors await  
Reborn from thy steel  
All thy wounds be healed  
From the earth to the sky  
Now the son of odin rise!  
Take thy place among the kings  
For thy soul shall never die!

No, no, not one of those, a real story  
A real story?  
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy  
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me  
A long way in time  
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day  
As I walked through the enchanted forest  
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms  
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds  
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill  
Before me there was a great plane  
Upon it the armies of the world,standing, waiting  
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?  
Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north  
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel  
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe  
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club  
And finally, from the west a rider  
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their  
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals  
They were few in number  
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them  
That they would leave this day only in victory or death  
And there was a great silence  
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness  
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger  
That I held fast to a tree  
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air  
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack  
Down to the battle they rode  
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash  
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day  
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom  
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead  
There was much blood and gore  
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field  
Like brown leaves blown by the wind  
And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill  
While below them the soldiers of death assembled  
All those who would now swear allegiance to them  
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer  
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side  
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride  
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail  
Cover me with death if I should ever fail  
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail  
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world  
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory  
Carried long and far throughout the land  
Well, That's it, did you like the story?  
Yeah, it was great!  
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you

So many reasons why  
You're the only one  
Who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
'Cause there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
So Take a look at me now  
So there's just an empty space  
But to wait for you  
Is All I can do  
When that's what I've got to face  
  
Take a good look at me now  
'Cause l'll still be standing (standing here)  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
That's the chance I've got to take

In the skies are like fireflies  
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark  
  
I've held hope in my two hands  
That there would be another chance  
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart  
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you run, run so far  
You've forgotten who you are  
Where you're from, it's like some other universe  
You count your steps, like they're regrets  
You catch one breath then lose the rest  
Wrong is right, right is left  
And there's nowhere left to turn  
  
So don't believe in everything  
You think, you think you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you let your heart be the compass  
You won't get lost, not if you trust it  
When you hear the sound of the trumpet  
Louder than ever before  
  
Oh, when you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Cause you're almost there  
Almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Almost there  
You're almost home

I'm lost inside the maze  
I guess I'm all alone in love  
  
I look into your eyes  
You turn the other way  
And now I realize  
It's all a game you play  
I hold you in the night  
And wake to find you gone  
You're running out of sight  
It's so hard holding on  
All alone in love

I'm calling out your name  
I watch you fade away

I've figured out your style  
To quickly drift apart  
You held me for a while  
Planned it from the start  
All alone in love  
  
Sitting in the dark without you  
How am I supposed to make it  
Through the night  
Slowly fall apart without you  
Cry away the hours  
Till the morning light

The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground  
  
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall  
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor  
Super natural love conquers all, remember we  
Used to touch the sky  
And lighting don't strike  
The same place twice, when you and I,  
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry  
True love's a gift,  
But we let it drift in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
  
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?  
Bring it back and we gon' make it right  
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love  
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear  
In a whirlwind  
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling  
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow  
  
I know I can stand just pull me back up  
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us  
I'm willing to live and die for our love

Break break down, steady breakin me on down.  
  
Mariah:  
  
You called yesterday to basicallly say  
That you care for me,  
But that you're just not in love  
Immediately I pretended  
To be feeling similarly  
And led you to believe it was O. K  
To just walk away from the one thing  
That's unyielding and sacred to me  
  
Chorus:  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath a disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Mariah:  
  
So what do you do  
When somebody you're so devoted to  
Suddenly just stops loving you  
And it seems they haven't got a clue  
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through  
Do you cling to your pride  
And sing ""I will survive""  
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""  
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away  
  
Wish:  
  
Yeah, c' mon, yeah, c' mon, c' mon  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath the disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly

The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Wish:  
  
It'll break you down  
Only if you let it  
Everday crazy situations rocking my mind  
Tryin' to break me down  
But I won't let it  
Forget it (forget it)  
  
Krayzie:  
  
I be feelin' like you bringing me down  
Taking me around  
Stressin' me out  
I think I better go and get out  
And let me release some stress (stress)  
  
Wish:  
  
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)  
Hoping for the sun  
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)  
Lord, I just wanna maintain  
  
Krayzie:  
  
Yeah, I can feel pressures ya'll  
But never the less  
Krayzie won't fall  
It's over, it's ending here (here)  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you

They become your life  
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside  
Blindly I imagined I could  
Keep you under glass  
Now I understand to hold you  
I must open up my hands  
And watch you rise  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were meant to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
I have learned that beauty  
Has to flourish in the light  
Wild horses run unbridled  
Or their spirit dies  
You have given me the courage  
To be all that I can  
And truly feel your heart will  
Lead you back to me when you're  
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me

Butterfly  
  
I can't pretend these tears  
Aren't over flowing steadily  
I can't prevent this hurt from  
Almost overtaking me  
ButI will stand and say goodbye  
For you'll never be mine  
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Everytime  
The guns goes blast  
Another day goes past  
I don't miss my dogs  
I'm wishing the days  
Could go fast  
So I could crash  
Close my eyes  
Try to go to sleep  
And bring you back but  
I can't bring you back  
(Nah can't bring you back)  
So I back  
Back memories of us  
Acting bad  
Wish time could freeze  
But time is up  
And I promise ya  
Imma hold it down  
Till it's my time  
To leave and I'm ok  
I mean  
Am allright not ok  
And it hurts my soul  
I won't see your face  
But if you truely  
Are in a better place  
Like what say  
And that's ok  
I'll be allright  
I've been up all night  
Like if I didn't  
With my nigga to be living  
With the time  
Tick-tick-ticking away  
So forever I'm forever  
I'm in search of yesterday  
(Yesterday)  
Like a beattle song  
I close my eyes  
Repeat the song  
Tryna bring us back  
To where we belong  
Middle of the club  
When be was on I tear  
The song blowing on  
Going back before  
So when I meet the don you  
Should know I meet way back  
With my dog when I go  
So when times says goodbye  
Y'all say hello  
  
(Mariah):  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
(Jay-Z):  
Rock with me  
Mc come one  
  
(Mariah):  
And you never got the chance  
To see how good I've done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you were here  
To celebrate together  
I wish that we could spend  
The holidays together  
  
I remember when you used  
To tuck me in at night  
With the Teddy Bear  
You gave to me  
That I held so tight  
I thought you  
Were so strong  
That you can make it  
Through whatever  
It's so hard  
To accept the fact  
You're gone forever  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
I wish I could find a way  
Try not to cry  
As time goes by  
And soon as you reach  
A better place  
Still I'll give  
The whole world  
To see your face  
And I'm right here  
Next to you  
It feels like you  
Gone too soon  
The hardest thing to do  
Is say bye, bye  
  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
This is for my people's  
Who just lost somebody  
Your best friend, your baby  
Your man or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
(Put em up, put em up)  
We will never say bye  
(No, no, no)  
Mamma's, daddy's, sisters  
Brothers, friends and cousins  
This is for my people's  
Who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head to the sky  
(Lift it up lift it up)  
Cause we will never  
Say bye, bye  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
(I never knew it)  
And everyday  
Life goes on like

I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile

Miss you  
But I try not to cry  
As time goes by  
(I wish, I wish

And as soon  
As you reached  
A better place  
Still I'll give the world  
To see your face  
And we were here  
Next to you  
It feels  
Like you're gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing  
To do  
Is say bye, bye

Somebody sing it with me  
Wave your hands up high

Mariah Carey,Candy Bling,/m/mariah+carey/candy+bling_20852227.html,"I still remember  
That hazy September  
I've been waiting for somebody like you  
To come back around  
  
We would walk in the park  
Every Saturday  
Brand new  
All in love  
Kissing time away  
You was all up on me  
It was plain to see  
That I was your girl  
Way back when it was the simple thing  
Anklets, Nameplates  
That you gave to me  
Sweet tarts, Ring pops, and that candy bling  
And you were my world  
  
Now I wish I could go back and make time stop  
I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
It was everything that I could do  
To stay awake  
And I often reminisce  
About the games we played  
It was Tag, Chess, Spin The Bottle  
Then butterflies would last till tomorrow  
Then the lights came on  
I had to run right home  
  
And now I wish I  
Could go back and my time stop  
And I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long

We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I still wishing we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
I'm a see Mimi  
Felt the need to change me  
Butterfly flow  
Like Mohamed Ali  
Wish I can bring you back  
Like the O.D.B  
Thinkin' bout the world  
Plus me you and Jack  
No matter what I do  
Well the memories are stacked  
Thinkin' tenth grade  
Thinkin' 'bout eleventh  
When you went doggy fresh  
All the way to heaven heaven heaven  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love

Mariah Carey,Don't Forget About Us,/m/mariah+carey/dont+forget+about+us_20489000.html,"(Don't forget about us)  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
No baby, no baby, no baby no  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
My baby boy  
  
Just let it die  
With no goodbyes  
Details don't matter  
We both paid the price  
Tears in my eyes  
You know sometimes  
It'd be like that baby  
  
Now every time I see you  
I pretend I'm fine  
When I wanna reach out to you  
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride  
Baby I must confess  
We were bigger than anything  
Remember us at our best  
And don't forget about  
  
[Chorus]  
Late nights, playin' in the dark  
And wakin' up inside my arms  
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and  
I can see it in your eyes  
You still want it  
So don't forget about us  
I'm just speaking from experience  
Nothing can compare to your first true love  
So I hope this will remind you  
When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us  
  
Oh they say  
That you're in a new relationship  
But we both know  
Nothing comes close to  
What we had, it perseveres  
That we both can't forget it  
How good we used to get it  
  
There's only one me and you  
And how we used to shine  
No matter what you go through  
We are one, that's a fact  
That you can't deny  
So baby we just can't let  
The fire pass us by  
Forever we'd both regret  
So don't forget about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if she's got your head all messed up now  
That's the trickery  
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be  
I bet she can't do like me  
She'll never be M-C  
  
Baby don't you, don't you forget about us

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
No baby, no baby, no baby no  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
  
When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us.

Strewn across the sky  
And we sat close enough  
That we just barely touched  
While roman candles  
Went soaring above us and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we wandered away  
I was trembling inside  
But I wanted to stay  
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind  
On that Fourth of July  
  
So starry eyed  
On the flowery hillside  
Breathless and fervid  
Amid the dandelions  
As it swept over me  
Like the wind trough the trees  
I felt you sigh with a  
Sweet intensity and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we floated away  
Delicately lay entwined  
In an intimate daze  
A crescent moon began to shine  
And I wanted to stay  
Tangled up with you among the fireflies  
On that Fourth of July  
  
Thunder clouds  
Hung around  
So threateningly  
Ominously hovering  
And the sky  
Opened wide  
Showering  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we ran from the rain  
Tentatively kissed goodnight  
And went our separate ways  
And I've never truly felt the way that I  
Felt the Fourth of July  
  
Truly I have never felt the same inside  
Like that Fourth of July

Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay  
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night  
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends  
She want to creep past the block spyin' again  
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away  
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day  
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb  
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers  
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies  
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib  
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm  
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms  
She call me ""Heartbreaker""  
When we apart, it makes her  
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""  
But she know she love Jay because  
She love everything Jay say, Jay does  
And uh

Finally opened up my eyes

Was right here all the time

Mariah Carey,Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse,/m/mariah+carey/me+i+am+mariah+the+elusive+chanteuse_21083602.html,"On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure  
This is my first and only self-portrait  
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it, ""Me. I am Mariah.""  
Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title  
Come on, I was only three and a half  
  
It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself  
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken  
I've kept this drawing private for so long  
But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that
have made me who I am today  
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care  
And have been here for me through it all  
I've been through a lot but I've always known me  
I am Mariah  
  
Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames  
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas  
Lately, they've been calling me, ""The Elusive Chanteuse""

Mariah Carey,Mine Again,/m/mariah+carey/mine+again_10174305.html,"I remember when you used to be mine  
Way back when  
I was too naive to love you right  
But now if I only had the opportunity  
I would do anything  
Because my heart still believes  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
It's irrelevant to dwell on the past  
I'm accountable for what went bad  
And I mean that  
But I keep on praying for another chance  
Just to have you back  
Cause I've grown  
And I know how to be your everything  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
No, no it ain't over yet  
I just can't accept the possibility  
We weren't made for each other's arms  
I know you're my destiny  
We can't erase what was meant to be  
Part of you and part of me  
If we try one more time  
Maybe somehow we'll survive  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Boy maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back to  
Life  
Maybe you could be mine

Shine in the evening Sun,  
Above are misty mountains,  
It's so beautiful  
As the wind caresses my eyes,  
Gazing gently at the sky,  
The Moon inside a halo,  
It's so beautiful  
  
When I think of all the beauty,  
That nature gives to me,  
From the flowers to the mountains,  
It's so beautiful  
There's glory and a wonder,  
Far wider than the sea,  
I say yes to all this loveliness  
It's so beautiful

You're currently engaged  
In an intimate conversation  
With a young groupie or two  
They say ""Players only love you  
When they're playing games""

Make me sing real high  
When he goes down low  
But see, it ain't just a physical thing  
He's gotta treat me affectionately  
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust  
Just like every other motherfucker does  
Is this just an impossible dream, baby  
Too elusive to pursue  
It's been such a sad and windy road for me

Why you listen to what people talk about  
You ain't figured out why they call ya  
The heavy steady hatin' cause

See how your money flows  
You dress in designer clothes  
From head to the toe  
You ain't satisfied, well tell me  
What you lookin' for  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, I'll be your one and only  
If you give me a chance  
I'll make the change for you, girl  
I know I ain't been the most faithful  
Nigga in the world  
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls  
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire  
To kiss your lips, I desire  
Twist and Mariah, together like a  
Grip on the tire  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better  
We can do whatever  
While we're sittin' on suede and leather  
Thinkin' through the city  
While we rollin' lonely  
Let's kick it in the Chi  
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie  
I know you were feelin'  
You really know your guy  
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high  
Let me pick the pieces up

Mariah Carey,One Child,/m/mariah+carey/one+child_20892737.html,"An angel appeared  
Of the highest One  
And Mary believed  
The word she received  
Of God's only son  
The Virgin rejoiced  
Gave thanks to the Lord  
And as Joseph dreamt  
The angel was sent  
With tidings of piece and joy  
Of the blessed baby boy  
  
They traveled for miles  
To reach Bethlehem  
Yet when they arrived  
No one could provide  
Place at the inn for them  
But God kept them safe  
From hurt, harm and danger  
In His warm embrace  
Away in a manger  
Waiting for Jesus' birth  
To glorify the Earth  
Then He came  
  
One child can change the world  
Christmas morn'  
The King of all Kings was born  
He reigns forevermore  
Let us worship and adore  
Christ the Lord  
  
Wondrous star  
Led shepherds and wise men  
Through valleys and mountains  
Angels surrounded them  
As they traveled far  
As Heaven and home  
Rang out for the Savior  
The sweet Prince of Peace  
Lay majestively  
Asleep glorious and pure  
And His mercy endures for always  
  
One child can change the world  
Christmas morn'  
The King of all Kings was born  
He reigns forevermore

Assumed you'd always be there  
Took your presence for granted

Without a sense of belonging to touch  
Somewhere halfway  
Feeling there's no one completely the same

Uncertainty forever lies

Somewhere on the  
Outside

Like golden petals scattering

So young predictably

With a maze of misery  
  
A boy and a girl befriended me  
We're bonded through despondency  
I stayed so long but finally  
I fled to save my sanity

You'll never ever find a girl  
Who loves you more than me

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off  
  
I found out about a gang  
Of your dirty little deeds  
With this one and that one  
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets  
Heard y'all was  
Hold up my phone's breakin' up  
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back  
I gotta get this off of my mind  
You wasn't worth my time  
so I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I need a real love in my life  
Save this recording because  
I'm never coming back home  
Baby I'm gone  
Don't cha know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

Attached to the dream

On the off chance you'd hear  
And if you happen to be somewhere listening  
You should know I'm still here

Is call me and let love rush in  
  
What can I say, I had a little extra time  
So I figured I might as well explain  
A couple little things to you

Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me

Thank you for embracing a flaxen-haired baby  
Although I'm aware you had doubts  
I guess anybody'd have had doubts  
  
Please be at peace father  
I'm at peace with you  
Bitterness isn't worth cling to  
After all the anguish we've all been through  
  
Thank you for the mountains  
The lake of the clouds  
I'm picturing you and me there right now  
As the crystal cascades showered down  
  
Strange to feel that proud, strong man  
Grip tightly to my hand  
Hard to see the life inside  
Wane as the days went by  
Trying to preserve each word  
He murmured in my ear  
Watch part of my life disappear  
  
Father, thanks for reaching out and lovingly  
Saying that you've always been proud of me  
I needed to feel that so desperately  
You're always alive inside of me  
Now you're shining like  
A sunflower up in the sky

You gave me has pulled me through

You rescued my love

Mariah Carey,The One,/m/mariah+carey/the+one_20088408.html,"See I'm going through a situation  
That I can't help  
Want to get a little closer  
But I promised myself  
That I would never give my heart  
Away again  
Oo oo babe, I know it's hard  
Butcha gotta understand it  
The truth is all the hurt and the pain  
And the shit that you get  
When you have it  
Ain't worth it  
I've been there so many times  
I should know better but I  
Can't stop what I feel  
When you're next to me  
I really think I  
  
Finally found somebody  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
  
(Baby you're the one)  
(Baby you're the one)  
  
See the problem with relationships  
In general is that it's always a game  
In the beginning they'll do  
Anything to have you  
And once they do it's never the same  
And I, know everyone out there can relate  
So the question is  
One: do I really want to trust this feeling  
Two: do I want to let it pass me by  
Three: do you think it's only superficial  
Four: could it actually be different this time  
Someone to love me  
Someone to be my everything  
Maybe I've stumbled upon  
  
Finally found somebody (The only one)  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love (No, no)  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (I just don't want to be hurt)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(But boy I think you might be the one)  
Finally found somebody  
That could be the one (Maybe I've found)  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (Boy I'm so afraid)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(Cause I know you're the one)  
  
Oh baby  
Sweet darling  
I  
I think I finally found  
  
Finally found somebody (The only one)  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (No)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
(I don't want to be hurt anymore)  
This is bad 'cause I know that you're the one

Finally found somebody  
Could be the one, but I promised myself (Finally found)  
That I wouldn't give in to love

That someone some day might come my way,  
And then I should know what's best to do.  
And if he'd got money, and seemed a nice chap,  
And his workday shirts were white as snow,  
And if he knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
I'd have to tell him, ""No!""  
That's where you must keep your head screwed on and insist on  
Going slow.  
Sure the moon will shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat is on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things can go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, ""No!""  
The first one that came was a man of Kent,  
And all that a man ought to be.  
The second one owned three ships down at Wopping,  
And the third was crazy about me.  
And as they'd got money, and all seemed nice chaps,  
And their workday shirts were white as snow,  
And as they knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
Each time I told them, ""No!""  
That's when I used to get my head screwed on and I chose to take  
It slow.  
Sure the moon could shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat was on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things could go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, ""No!""  
But then one day, and the day was blue,  
Came a man who didn't ask at all.  
And he went and hung his hat on the nail of my little attic,  
And what happened, I can't recall.  
And as he'd got no money and was not a nice chap,  
And his Sunday shirts were not like snow,  
And as he'd no idea of treating a girl with due respect,  
I could not tell him, ""No!""  
That's the day my head was not screwed on, and to hell with going  
Slow!  
Oh, the moon could shine so clear and bright,  
Oh, the boat kept drifting downstream that night,  
That was how it simply had to go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
In the end you'll have to let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you know it might start,

Has grown there for two score years or more  
And I've grown weary waiting for love to say  
""Come my way, come my way.""

Has danced this mercy dance since time begun  
But o how weary and how long the day will he say  
""Come my way.""

Happiness to every girl and boy.

Marianne Faithfull,Comrade,/m/marianne+faithfull/comrade_20088731.html,"Little months little smokes  
And oblivion in a wool dress  
In a door opens tenderly  
Near a wall where the wind is born  
Near the jolly garden  
Where saints and angels  
Are afraid of the seasons  
The alleys have no names  
They are the hours or the years  
I stroll leisurely  
Dressed in a cement overcoat  
And a hat of black straw  
I don't remember  
If it's nice out  
I walk smoking  
And I smoke walking  
Easily  
Every once in a while I tell myself  
It's time to stop  
And I continue walking  
I tell myself  
I have to get some air  
I have to look at the clouds  
And breathe in a lung full  
I have to see the flies fly  
And take a little exercise  
I shouldn't smoke so much  
I tell myself also  
Calculate  
I tell myself again  
I have a headache  
My life is a drop of water on my eyelid  
And I'm no longer twenty  
Continue  
The songs are songs  
And the days days  
I no longer have one shred of respect for myself  
But I see no hoodlums  
Who smoke the same cigarettes as me  
And who are just as stupid as me  
I'm pretty content  
Without really knowing why  
It doesn't suffice to speak of the sun  
The stars  
The sea and rivers  
Blood eyes hands  
It is necessary quite often  
To speak of other things  
We know that there are very beautiful countries  
With very handsome men  
With no less charming women,  
But all that isn't really sufficient  
But dizzying void  
Which rings and bays  
Makes the head bow  
We look and we see  
Again many other things  
Which are always the same  
Innumerable  
Identical  
And over there simply  
Someone goes by  
Simple as hello  
And everything starts all over once again  
I read in the stars the good will of my friends  
In a river I love one hand  
I listen the flowers sing  
There are the goodbyes of birds  
A cry falls like a fruit  
My God my God  
I will be accordingly always the same  
My head in my hands  
And my hands in my head

I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight.  
It's taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for forty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
He came from Miami to start out again.  
To leave him was easy, I did it all the time.  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,  
If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for thirty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
I was an actress, a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy.  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris,  
I'm only talkin' 'cause you looked like you needed a friend.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for twenty-five dollars I'm half-way

Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes  
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows  
Of night, here with you in my arms.  
  
This is the moment that pauses to hold us  
As you and I move in a background of wonder,  
Surrounded by countless enclosures  
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.  
  
Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower  
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,  
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings  
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,  
You see how I need you, come down.  
  
And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,  
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,  
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us  
And nestled against us  
  
You're here  
And warm.  
  
And mine till the time  
When the dawn will awake you,  
The morning will shake you,  
The highway will take you.  
  
But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets  
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights  
We count on the night to hold everything even,  
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,  
And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.  
  
But now as the gardens of softening night time  
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,  
You and I come together  
And walk through the dreams of the stars.  
  
So here while the song of the deepening evening  
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,  
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow  
And know where we've been.

When I get back on the street  
Tell everybody that I meet  
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you

Telling me I got to beware.  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Battle lines being drawn,  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.  
Some people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
What a field day for the heat,  
There's a thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly saying, ""Hooray for our kind!""  
It's time we stop,

Everybody look what's going down.  
Stop,

Into your life it will creep.  
It starts when you're always afraid,  
Get out of line, the men come and take you away.

We've gotten word from Philadelphia  
Anna's doing well, she's making lots of money.  
Her contract has been signed to do a solo turn,  
It forbids her ever eating when or what she likes to eat,  
She likes to eat, she likes to eat.  
  
Those are hard terms for little Anna,  
Who has always been very greedy.  
Oh if she does not break her contract!  
There's no market for hippos in Philadelphia!  
  
Every single day they weigh her,  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
They have principles to stand by:  
It's a hundred-and-eighteen that were signed for -  
Only for the weight agreed we pay!  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
More than that would mean disaster!  
  
But our Anna is not all that stupid  
And she knows a contract is a contract  
So she'll reason: After all  
You still can eat like little Anna  
In Louisiana - Crabmeat! Porkchops!  
Sweet-corn! Chicken!  
And those golden biscuits spread with honey!  
  
Think of our house in Louisiana!  
Look - it's growing! More and more it needs you!  
Therefore curb your craving! Gluttons will be punished!  
Curb your craving, Anna! Gluttons never go to Heaven!

Isolation.  
  
I don't expect you to understand  
After you caused so much pain  
But then again you're not to blame  
You're just a human, a victim of the insane.  
  
We're afraid of everyone  
Afraid of the sun,  
Isolation.  
The sun will never disappear  
But the world may not have many years,  
Isolation

That old song about the wild, wild side of life.  
As I listen to the words you are saying,  
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you say in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,  
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.  
From the start most every heart that's been broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame.

For a couple of hours or so.  
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,  
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,  
But like a silly fool I fell  
  
Mad about the boy,  
I know it's stupid  
To be mad about the boy.  
I'm so ashamed of it  
But must admit  
The sleepless nights  
I've had about the boy.  
  
On the silver screen  
He melts my foolish heart  
In every single scene.  
Although I'm quite aware  
That here and there  
Are traces of that cared about the boy.  
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,  
I really shouldn't care.  
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl  
In the flurry of her first affair.  
Will it ever cloy  
This odd diversity of misery and joy  
I'm feeling quite insane  
And young again  
And all because  
I'm mad about the boy.

For a girl of my age and weight  
To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.  
It ought to take her a good deal more  
To take a bad girl down.  
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate  
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love  
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown  
To weep about a painted clown.  
  
Mad about the boy,  
It's pretty funny  
But I'm mad about the boy.  
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel  
There's maybe something sad about the boy.  
  
Walking down the street  
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.  
I can't believe it's true,  
But when I'm blue, in some strange way  
I'm glad about the boy.  
  
I'm hardly sentimental,  
Love isn't so sublime.  
I have to pay my rental  
And I can't afford to waste much time.  
If I could employ a little magic  
That would finally destroy  
This dream that pains me and it shames me

Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair  
And the ship, The Black Freighter runs a flag up its masthead  
And a cheer rings the air  
By noontime the dock is a swarmin' with men  
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter  
They're movin' in the shadows where no one can see  
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' 'em to me  
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock and so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death, I'll say, ""Right now, right now!""  
Then they'll pile up the bodies  
And I'll say, ""That'll learn ya!""

Won't you sing it once before I move along?  
  
Oh, won't you sing me back home? There's a songs I used to hear  
Make my old memories come alive

Sing me back home before I die

It is best to find in sleep  
The missing pieces that you lost  
Best that you refuse to weep  
Ash to ash, dust to dust.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
Strange to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is safe to walk with me  
Where you can read the sky and stars,  
Safe to walk upon the sea  
In my sleep we can go far.

So now I have to mingle with the meek  
Hey mister, you have finally met your match  
Now everybody wants to kiss my snatch  
  
To go where God knows who has gone before  
I am a muse, not a mistress, not a whore  
Oh, suburban shits who want some class  
All queue up to kiss my ass  
  
And I was only trying to please  
I never got any royalties oh no, not me  
I'm still sliding through life on charm

If Marianne was born a man she'd show you all  
A way to piss your life against the wall  
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs  
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?  
  
Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?  
I had to know how far was going too far  
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand  
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me  
  
Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?  
She's just captivated by my charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
Sliding  
Sliding  
Never  
  
I wonder why the schools don't teach anything useful nowadays  
Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal  
I never asked to be on in the first place  
  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm

This is a photograph of who I might be  
Man in a uniform, bride on his arm  
Mum always was a fool for money and charm  
  
He's been talkin' in his sleep again  
Sayin' he's sorry, callin' my name  
Sayin' how he's so ashamed  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
  
Since it happened I had nothin' to say  
It used to bother them but now it's okay  
Mother cleans his dreadful house every day  
Scrubbing at the stains that won't go away  
  
They sent me away to the school in the park  
They said it would be good for me  
I still hear the other kids cry in the dark  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
Is there no escape from the lap of luxury  
  
I don't remember the last time I cried  
I don't remember much except lies  
See the little girl spirallin' down  
This is a photograph of who she is now  
  
""One day this will all be yours"" he said  
Tidy your room and straight to bed  
Tidy up those thoughts in your head  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
  
I could be anywhere right now  
If I only had the nerve to leave this house  
Maybe somewhere by the sea  
Take me somewhere, anywhere please!  
  
We could make a pillow of sand and sleep  
We could roll  
We could make  
We could see  
We could scream  
  
Far, Father, Farthest  
Oh daddy, you do not do anymore  
  
For God's sake don't pretend to be concerned  
Turn into nightmares in the end  
Throw a party for all my friends  
  
I. Now Wash your Hands  
You give up hope  
You settle down  
With your favourite soap  
  
Now wash your hands

No incantations of remorse, my friend  
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend  
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot  
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare  
Who gouged the notches from the family tree  
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance  
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing  
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision  
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision  
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell the creed of tempered diction  
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption  
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour  
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds  
Let bitter silence infect the wound  
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone  
Parading a Hollywood conscience  
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish  
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success  
A non com observer - I assassin the collector - defector  
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend  
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend

Eternal romantic victory failed on Beaujolais day  
  
I heard a wheelchair whisper across a stale silent gymnasium  
Trailing an ivy league jacket like a matador  
Through the jitterbug steps of the night before  
  
Through the chalk white chill and the tear fandango  
Heading away to the inner wrangle  
Do we cry for a cell?  
Do we need for a cell?  
  
What would you do, would you cry for me?  
Could you set off, could we go gently?  
Blame it away  
Do you really want to head for the open door?  
  
Got to crack a bottle while you dream for me  
Just an absent friend and a misery  
Laying awake do we stay right there

To curl, under a cascade of neon pollen  
While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father  
Your carnation will rot in a vase.  
  
A train sleeps in a siding  
The driver guzzles another can of lager  
To wash away the memories of a Friday night down at the club  
  
She was a wallflower at sixteen  
She'll be a wallflower at thirty four  
Her mother called her beautiful  
Her daddy said, ""A whore"".

Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand  
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears  
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear  
""'J'entend ton coeur""

On the outskirts of nowhere  
On the ring road to somewhere  
On the verge of indecision  
I'll always take the roundabout way  
Waiting on the rain  
For I was born with a habit, from a sign  
The habit of a windswept thumb

Some of us go down in a haze of publicity  
The price of infamy, the edge of insanity  
  
Another Holiday Inn, another temporary home  
And an interviewer threatened me with a microphone  
'Talk to me, won't you tell me your stories.""  
  
So I talked about conscience and I talked about pain

Trying to pick up a war  
They're going to even the score  
Oh... I can't take any more  
I see black flags on factories  
Soup ladies poised on the lips of the poor  
I see children with vacant stares, destined for rape in the alleyways  
Does anybody care, I can't take any more!  
Should we say goodbye?  
  
I see priests, politicians?  
Heroes in black plastic body-bags under nations' flags

Drenched in napalm, this is no Vietnam

Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams  
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen  
Patience my tinsel angel  
Patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you  
You'll charm them with that smile  
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday  
Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of London  
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland  
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles  
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause  
She'll pray for endless Sundays as she enters saffron sunsets  
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn  
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the St. Tropez mirage  
Fragrant aphrodisiac, the withered tuberose  
Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile  
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday  
[Hello John, did you see The Standard about four hours ago?  
Fished a young chick out of The Old Father  
Blond hair, blue eyes. She said she wanted to be an actress or something  
Nobody knows where she came from, where she was going  
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face  
She was smiling, what a waste]  
Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress  
Buried in her cellophane world in glitter town  
Of Chelsea Monday

Three dimensions down dissolving on the Cinderella search, Cinderella search

Swam through the nicotine seize, and we exchanged the kiss of life  
Resurrection in a trance, the model, the Grail, in a Marquee of promises  
I touched the dream, I hold the dream, I have the dream  
  
To end the Cinderella search, Cinderella search, oh no more, no more!  
Exposing bedside manners on a work extension  
Awaiting development with paranoid Polaroid eyes, Polaroid eyes  
The footman memorised the number  
  
But the prince still holds both the slippers  
And would you leave a palace for a bed sit  
And Canterbury Tales, Canterbury Tales?  
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill of the chase  
  
Maybe you were always beyond my reach and my heart was playing safe  
But was that love in your eye I saw or the reflection of mine?

Little did I know that even a heavy load  
I found us walking Grierson's dockyards  
Where the only thing working was foreign film crews  
Making an impressive documentary  
  
For the big news  
To the satellite  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a sense of pride and identity  
  
The waters left behind we shouldn't forget  
Laid low in the books of history  
I saw the starlings wheel round Georgian spires  
Gathering on patrol in the skies  
  
In the distance burns the flame of Grangemouth  
And the dream is lost  
Everything what it could inspire  
From the take you know there is no distance  
  
How we talk about in the secret affairs  
Taking our ride into the distance  
To be what it was or could have been  
What I should have said  
  
And all we're left with is the black black oil

'Till we take some more steps to unity

Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea  
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams  
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame  
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name

Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear

His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky

Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart  
  
Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell  
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell  
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife  
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries  
  
Screams are his music, lightning his guide  
Raping the darkness, death by his side  
  
Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams  
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene  
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe  
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know  
  
Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave  
Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the
brave

You should have known better after all this time  
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander  
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes  
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame  
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame  
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame  
  
So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws  
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives  
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot  
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods  
  
Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand  
You call for justice and distort the truth  
Well I've had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches  
Receive your punishment, Expose your throats to my righteous claws  
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, flow, flow, flow.

I whistle it's tune  
After so much noise  
Freedom is silence  
  
Half the house is missing  
Taken half of me with it  
I had imagined this  
Hurting in a different way  
Hurting in a different way  
  
I still have the hi-fi  
Quiet at all volumes  
As my dull thoughts  
Echo viscous and slow like the tolling of some great bell under water  
  
When she cries she cuts me  
And when she smiles I want to die  
Afraid of knowing myself  
Our eyes stare out while we hide inside  
  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
  
The open windows  
Let in the spring air today  
And the birds sing their thankfully happy, brainless song  
But the silence here finds a way to stay  
Some kind of explosion  
God, if you hear me  
Throw me a line or strike me down  
Do you refuse even to accuse  
c'mon, do your worst  
But lift this curse  
  
Built this house on solid ground  
But now it's crumbling tumbling down  
Will nobody here even cry out for help?  
As it slowly collapses into itself  
  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
  
Hanging on to this pain  
It's no good  
It's no good

Betrayed by a porcelain tear, a stained career  
  
You played this scene before, you played this scene before  
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye  
A misplaced reaction  
  
The darkroom unleashes imagination in pornographic images  
In which you will always be the star, always be the star, untouchable  
Unapproachable, constant in the darkness  
Nursing an erection, a misplaced reaction  
With no flower to place before this gravestone  
And the walls become enticingly newspaper thin  
But that would be developing the negative view  
And you have to be exposed in voyeuristic colour  
The public act, let you model your shame  
On the mannequin catwalk, catwalk  
Let the cats walk, and the cat walks

The custodian of your private fears, your leading actor of yesteryear  
Who as you crawled out of the alleys of obscurity  
Sentenced to rejection in the morass of anonymity  
You who I directed with lovers will, you who I let hypnotise the lens  
You who I let bathe in the spotlights glare  
You who wiped me from your memory like a greasepaint mask  
Just like a greasepaint mask  
  
But now I'm the snake in the grass, the ghost of film reels past  
I'm the producer of your nightmare and the performance has just begun  
It's just begun  
  
Your perimeter of courtiers jerk like celluloid puppets  
As you stutter paralysed with rabbits eyes, searing the shadows  
Flooding the wings, to pluck elusive salvation from the understudy's lips  
Retrieve the soliloquy, maintain the obituary  
My cue line in the last act and you wait in silent solitude  
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt

Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.  
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,  
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.

To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,  
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.

Empty chambers embracing the end.  
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,  
  
Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.  
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,  
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,  
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.

Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock  
  
The colours stand still  
And then they move around  
Comin' in and out of focus upside down  
  
Empty winter trees  
How space feels  
Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky  
  
One fine day  
The chaos subsides  
Bleeds into awareness  
And a lifetime of surprise  
  
The beauty of your mothers eyes  
The pain when you fall  
You drink it in and marvel at it all  
But you never really figure it out  
  
You get used to it  
  
The babble of the family  
And the dumb TV  
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets  
  
Chemicals in the water  
Drugs in the food  
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system  
  
The attitude of authority  
The laws and the rules

Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round  
  
Holdin' on, holdin' on  
  
The greed and the missiles  
Exploding somewhere every day  
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

And the loaded prayers  
Information  
The face of starvation and the state of the nation  
  
The sense that it's useless  
And the fear to try  
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us

And still she's prepared  
To tell me she'll stay

And we're gonna be over the hill

Averting your eyes from the staring questions  
How were those bruises made

Children clutching to your legs

And noses in his private affairs

Trying to find out where to lay the blame  
But when it comes right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
I heard Sinatra calling me down through the floorboards  
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme  
To the jukebox crying in the corner  
While the waitress is counting out the time  
  
For when it gets right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
'Cause I know what I feel, know what I want I know what I am  
Daddy took a raincheck  
'Cause I know what I want, know what I feel I know what I need  
Daddy took a raincheck, your daddy took a raincheck  
Ain't no one in here that's left to blame but me  
Blame it on me, blame it on me  
  
Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone  
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone  
Can't you understand that the government left me out of work  
I just couldn't stand the looks on their faces saying, ""What a jerk""  
  
So if you want my address it's number one at the end of the bar  
Where I sit with the broken angels clutching at straws and nursing our scars  
Blame it on me, blame it on me,  
Sugar mice in the rain, your daddy took a raincheck

When streetlights throw crosses through window frames  
Paranoia roams where the shadows reign  
Oh, at that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Your senses tangled in some new perfume  
Criticism triggers of a loaded room  
Oh, at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
How do I fell inside  
I could honestly tell you  
We've been taken on a very long ride  
And if my owners let me  
Have some free time some day  
With all good intention  
I would probably run away  
Clutching the short straw  
  
At that time of the night  
When questions rally in an open mind  
Summon all your answers with an ice cube chime  
At that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Pretend you're off the hook with the telephone  
Your confidence wounded in a free fire zone  
Oh, at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
Where do I go from here  
My next destination  
Even isn't really that clear  
So if you join me  
And get on your knees and prey  
I'll show you salvation  
We'll take the alternative way  
Clutching the short straw  
  
If I had enough money  
I'd buy a round for that boy over-there  
A companion in my madness in the mirror  
The one with the silvery hair  
And if some kind soul  
Could please pick up my tab  
And while they're at it  
If they could pick up my broken heart  
  
Warm wet circles

I looked down on the city  
From up in the sky  
The sun was reflecting  
From the roofs and the water  
Spring had come early  
In the parks and the old town  
I came with a mission  
To patch up a dream  
We walked and I talked and my words were absorbed  
Into the answering machine  
  
I came two thousand miles  
Just to take a look at you  
But you were broken and frozen  
A heartbreak of a statue  
In the bullet-proof mirrors  
Where your eyes used to be  
I stared at myself and I called for some help  
Into the answering machine  
  
The day slipped by and I tried and tried  
You took me home and you said  
""Goodnight, Sleep tight""  
On the floor by the bedroom door  
I watched you sleep and I left before first light  
  
The bugs don't bite  
The bugs don't bite  
The bugs bite  
  
From the land of the frozen  
To the land of the low  
We journeyed together  
But we were always alone  
So if I should come calling  
Best not pick up the phone  
Cause I'm no good for you and you're no good for me  
Let me talk to the answering machine  
I can cope with the answering machine  
I'm a friend of the answering machine

Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience, evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there there's someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers, all our prayers...  
  
Are we too far gone, are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls, or do we just not care  
We're terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isn't quite that near  
We make futile gestures, act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down, down to deliver us  
We'll find out that after all, we're only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
We'll find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind, you're out of your depth, you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us don't give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And you'll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside we're
all one and the same  
  
We're clutching at straws  
We're still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
We're still drowning, yeah clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning  
We're clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning

At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place  
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog  
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes  
Lived in the shadow of the mountains  
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather  
And the polished wood of his bed  
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river  
Holding the hands of his mother  
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread  
  
And his father on the other side of the world  
On the ships railings and some far away tide  
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad  
In his far away eyes  
In his far away eyes  
  
The smell of the wax on the wooden floor  
Mixture of polish and soap  
No children to fear or to play with  
Rows of empty hooks for the coats  
An upright piano and the boys in the choir  
Still remind him of just before he was born  
Remind him of just before he was breathing  
Strange misty visions of God  
Turn the cities into families  
Into villages of souls  
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping  
With their houses invisible  
Chase the moon between the buildings  
Running as fast as I could run  
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas  
Whispering, ""You're the only one""  
  
And ever since I was a boy  
I never felt that I belonged  
Like everything they did to me  
Was an experiment to see  
How I would cope with the illusion  
In which direction would I jump  
Would I do it all the same  
As the actors in the game  
Or would I spit it back at them  
And not get caught up in their rules  
And live according to my own  
And not be used, not be used  
To find the fundamental truths  
It was going to take some time  
Thirty five summers down the line  
The wisdom of each passing year  
Seems to serve only to confuse

Daddy came out the navy and took us away  
To his dirty grey home town  
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service

Of his Triumph motor bike  
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner  
Holding tight  
  
From the horizon  
Came home from the Navy to the mine  
From the horizon  
To buried alive  
Took his dream underground  
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes  
  
And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine  
Of a half remembered afternoon  
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain  
Found the boy, decided that his time had come  
Came down out of the sky  
Stung him in the face

Screaming like baptism

Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you sit a while with me  
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory  
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay  
Table mountain, flying fish, banana spiders, pots of paint  
And the sun on the equator  
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water  
From crimson to black  
But coming back  
Tomorrow  
On the horizon  
  
The blue pain  
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade  
It stayed  
Blue  
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine  
This love  
  
This love  
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond  
This puzzle  
I don't understand  
That knows no faith  
And tries and fails  
And tries again  
Stares at the sea  
The night's dark deep  
For one last time  
And bleeds  
And bleeds  
And dies for you  
And lies  
And is to blame  
And is ashamed  
And is not the same  
And is true  
And is true

The wheels spin slowly backwards  
Strobing in the amber light

This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses me up like a stranger  
This town performs in the window like the ultimate gift  
This town takes us down

We were saving our money for half of our lives  
We were saving our dreams  
And we came to this place to make the chances real  
In the big city  
But I've been counting the days  
I've been watching you change  
And I can feel it dying  
The noise outside takes you in its arms  
Like a lamb to a lion  
  
And down there somewhere among the noise  
The magazine dolls and the big money boys  
Move silently on their easy heels  
They move silently on their greasy wheels  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses you up like a stranger  
This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me I'm late

Another tune we almost remember  
What's the story  
Sex and drugs again  
Business as usual  
The clock's already ticking  
La la la la  
  
When he was young  
Staring at the TV  
He watched the fun happenin' to other people  
Now they scream  
As they run after him  
Like a dream  
Like Elvis and the Beatles  
  
A three minute song is all he wrote  
He only did it for a joke  
They played him on the radio  
From Tokyo to Timbuktu  
A three minute boy, ain't that somethin'  
They named their children after him  
The good times rolled beneath his feet  
He skipped along the one-way street  
  
She's a pretty girl  
She don't know how it started  
She made a movie  
He almost remembered  
She measured up  
They moved into a basement  
""We're so in love!""  
They giggled to the nation  
La la la la  
  
Three minute millionaire they said  
The numbers rattled round his head  
They spun him three times round the globe  
She waited patiently at home  
And all the pretty girls wanted him  
In places that he'd never been  
Too much love will do you in  
Forgive Forgive Forgive Forgive  
Yeah Yeah Ooo  
  
Three minute kid is here again  
Surrounded by three minute friends  
He found someone to understand  
To shock the world and hold his hand  
No religion, no restraint  
No direction, no complaints  
No future and no way out  
No time now to think about it  
All the money's gone  
He don't know what he spent it on  
  
Girlfriends gone off with the Jag  
Gone back to her mum and dad  
He's curled up on the studio floor  
He just can't do it anymore  
The flashgun went off without warning  
He'll read about it tomorrow morning  
  
She's goin' out with someone new  
In this week at number two  
Three minute boy ain't that somethin'

The match was rained off Saturday but the panel came in bright  
And on Sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub  
  
And on Monday you went to London  
To pick the cheque up with your mum  
You had a tux on, you had a tux on  
The first time you had a tux on, lucky man  
  
There's a photo on the mantelpiece, when you bought your first guitar  
And your girlfriend came to see you when you were the rising star  
You knew your luck was holding when you filled the local hall  
The first time and the last time that you thought you had control  
  
You had a tux on, lucky man, you had a tux on  
You got a tux on, tux on

Standing with your manager, your back to every bar  
  
Burning all your credit cards, chopping out the pain  
Crowding into toilets with a host of your new-found friends  
You got a tux on, nothing's changed, you got a tux on  
Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on

A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein  
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late  
The final performance, the main man lies in state  
  
With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on  
Somewhere in a tenement, in a well-thumbed magazine  
Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream  
  
The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life  
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive  
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
He's gonna get one with a tux on, free admission with a tux on  
  
Get it anyway with a tux on  
He's got a tux on the easy way with a tux on, tux on

Last nights hero picking up his dues

Chalking up a name in your hometown  
Standing all your mates to another round  
Laughing at the world 'til the barman wipes away the warm wet circles  
The warm wet circles  
  
I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths  
A classroom's shabby butterflies  
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes  
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts and token proclamations  
Rolled from stolen lipsticks across the razored webs of glass  
  
Sharing cigarettes with experience with her giggling jealous confidantes  
She faithfully traces his name with quick bitten fingernails  
Through the tears of condensation that'll cry through the night  
As the glancing headlights of the last bus kiss adolescence goodbye  
In a warm wet circle  
  
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart, a warm wet circle  
Like a bullet hole in Central Park, a warm wet circle  
And I'll always surrender to the warm wet circles  
  
She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse  
Giving it all away before it's too late  
She'll let a lovers tongue move in a warm wet circle  
Giving it all away and showing no shame  
She'll take a mother's kiss on her first broken heart a warm wet circle

Get your gunn, get your gunn

On the talk shows for the weak

And goodguy badges

Dear god do you want to climb of that tree  
Meat in the shape of a 'T'  
Dear god the paper says you were the King  
In the black limousine  
Dear John and all the King's men  
Can't put your head together again  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made  
But you are plastic and so are your brains  
  
Dear god the sky is as blue  
As a gunshot wound  
Dear god if you were alive  
You know we'd kill you  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made

They just glitter like a morgue  
And I dreamed I was a spaceman  
Burned like a moth in a flame  
And our world was so fucking gone  
  
But I'm not attached to your world  
Nothing heals and nothing grows  
  
Because it's a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves,  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low, I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say?  
  
And hell was so cold  
All the vases are so broken  
And the roses tear our hands all open  
Mother Mary miscarry  
But we pray just like insects  
The world is so ugly now  
  
Because it's a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves,  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low, I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say?
