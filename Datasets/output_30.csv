Soundtrack in the wind, like classic violins  
I can be your rhythm in the silence  
And every time we sing, it echoes in the sky  
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize  
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night  
Listen to the words as I let 'em fly  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

There's a breeze, though the wind has died  
Though I'm alone in the old corral,  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,  
The strays of long ago,  
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border,  
Or a band of Navajo  
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely,  
As ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,  
There's no song, still I hear guitars,  
There is no dust, still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars  
  
[Chorus]

To get to Hollywood or bust

Soon develop that movie mania  
  
Driving their jalopies through the dust

Underneath that moonlight in Malibu  
  
Lovers stroll in the dark  
  
Jeepers creepers ten to one sleepers are winning at Hollywood Park

Dean Martin,Honey,/d/dean+martin/honey_20821737.html,"See the tree how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig  
Then the first snow came  
And she ran out to brush the snow away  
It wouldn't die  
Came running in all excited  
Slipped and almost hurt herself  
I laughed till I cried  
She was always young at heart  
Kinda dumb and kinda smart  
I loved her so  
I surprised her with a puppy  
Kept me up all Christmas Eve  
Two years ago  
It would sure embarrass her  
When I came home from working late  
'Cause I would know  
That she'd been sitting there and crying  
Over some sad and silly  
Late, late show  
And Honey, I miss you  
I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
She wrecked the car and she was sad  
And so afraid that I'd be mad  
But what the heck  
Though I pretended hard to be  
Guess you could say she saw through me  
And hugged my neck  
I came home unexpectedly  
And found her crying needlessly  
In the middle of the day  
It was in the early spring  
When flowers bloom and robins sing  
She went away  
And Honey, I miss you  
And I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
Yes, one day while I wasn't home  
When she was there and all alone  
The angels came  
Now all I have is memories  
Of Honey and I wake up nights  
And call her name  
Now my life's an empty stage  
Where Honey lived and Honey played  
And love grew up  
A small cloud passes overhead  
And cries down in the flower bed  
That Honey loved  
See the tree, how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig

It may be love or war or mopping up the floor but just do it  
Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll rue it

If you're a fake you won't make it  
Wait for your break and then take it  
For time and tide they wait for no man go go go man  
Do it  
To prove a point at hand just look at old Miles Standish who blew it  
He said John Alden will you go ask Priscilla to do it

Do you remember when  
Things seemed so eternal?  
Heroes were so real...  
Their magic frozen in time  
The only way to learn  
Is be aware and hold on tight  
  
I close my eyes  
And sink within myself  
Relive the gift of precious memories  
In need of a fix called innocence  
  
When did it begin?  
The change to come was undetectable  
The open wounds expose the importance of  
Our innocence  
A high that can never be bought or sold  
  
Symbolic acts, so vivid  
Yet at the same time  
Were invisible

Hide the blade of the deceiver.  
  
Enforce the words no more, be free  
Alone you might just find serenity.

To give away another piece of life  
To forgive is to suffer

Three or four is blind

Another day goes rushing by and here we are just wondering why  
We have to belong with a sense of purpose  
That's all we need, without them we're worthless  
Ah, we've come so far, hm, but then again  
All we see is more of the same  
It's getting crowded here we agree no doubt  
Oh dear brother what's it all about?  
  
Hey you over there why don't you throw down your spear?  
We all need some help right now  
Where are we going from here?  
The way things are working out  
It won't be too long before we have to move  
Better start thinking about it  
While there's still time to choose  
  
Every day of my life I discover  
Someone murdering my sisters and brothers  
In the name of some god or another  
What do you know  
  
For the first precious few it's time to go  
What might have been we'll never know  
All those bad ideas became the law  
Oh yes, we've forgotten what we're looking for  
All of you angels it's time to gather your wings  
Leave it all behind you won't need any of those things  
We're going on through the darkness hand in hand  
To step into the future  
Before time began  
  
And for those who remain with your chosen gods  
May your prayers be answered.

Along the Mountain Road to do some

Oh my dear it's time for bed  
Time for you to go  
Everyone is asleep  
  
The pirates took to water, stole the charts  
But sadly that didn't go down well with those upstairs  
Who require loyalty  
The establishment considered  
That the uncontrolled appreciation of music  
Was a danger to royalty  
The mighty empire roared  
As Cash 'n' Everett on the high seas  
Looked like they'd get blown out of the water  
They did of course eventually come ashore  
As meek as mice or to be more accurate  
As lambs to the slaughter  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
I stand to attention  
Oh Fanny, I love you dearly  
Something else I should mention?  
You sweet thing  
  
Let's not talk about MTV  
I don't even want to start  
I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio  
We're talking about the state of the art  
  
Mr Grover 'n' Mr Gillian  
You musta made a million  
The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire  
Could you tell us all about it  
Keep it short and use my version  
Or everyone out there'll think I'm a liar  
We can speak about Bananas for one second  
Just because I understand  
You have to get them off your chest  
But in the meantime while your talking  
Could you do some more of these here ID's  
And then this station might maintain some interest  
  
Oh yes I love you dearly  
But why do you exist?  
Oh yes I love you really  
Is there something that I missed?

Playing my guitar  
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all  
Maybe I'll go far  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream  
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs  
Dream away the day  
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies  
This is where I'll stay  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Oh, in a dream  
Watching as a red and white balloon  
Sails across my mind  
In between the images that drift along my tune  
Smile as they unwind  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream

I tell you that little girl's kiss could kill  
She got me standing on a one way street  
Can't break the chains, the ties that bind  
Slave to the rhythm and my heart's in time  
Beware the taste is bittersweet  
When the lights go down, and you hit the ground  
It'll happen so fast,....

Slow down sister

On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn't have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
They burned down the gambling house  
It died with an awful sound  
Funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
We ended up at the grand hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know we'll never forget  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

There's a rumor going round  
That the other lived in hope  
So I walked in the room  
And I stopped  
I turned around  
And looked over my shoulder  
And a voice close beside me said  
You'd better watch your head  
The party's over  
  
It wasn't long before  
The waitress came over and said  
Can I freshen up your drink

Shut my eyes

Was something I'd already heard  
  
Johnny Ringo's voice  
Is getting deeper  
And now he's going to put  
Another lock on the door  
The night is getting later  
My head is getting lighter  
The mood is getting darker  
Tequila's being poured  
So I smile  
At the old gunslinger  
In his frame on the wall  
As he pushed back his hat  
And it's all coming back  
I'd cut a long story short  
But it's much too late for that  
  
Somebody stole my guitar  
They took it from  
The back seat of my car  
  
I was sleeping in Memphis  
In my hotel room  
And somebody stole my guitar

Some gold upon the floor, and said

Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said

When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder

Well could it be the pressure that I'm under

Deep Purple,Vavoom: Ted The Mechanic,/d/deep+purple/vavoom+ted+the+mechanic_20038795.html,"Playing pool and drinking beer  
Nothin' more'n the  
Occasional tear  
But this man's life goes on  
And he gets  
Greased all over  
From time to time  
At the strip joint, where we met  
He said 'Hi, my name is Ted  
See that one over there  
That ball of thunder  
Every time she goes Vavoom,  
I wiggle in my chair  
Can I buy you a beer?  
What a guy  
  
I've had a few myself he said  
But I never quit when I'm ahead  
Too many rules and regulations  
Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors  
And another thing I won't discuss is religion  
It always causes a fight  
Vavoom  
There she goes again  
'How does she do that' said Ted  
  
And he told me  
Of those unjustices (that)  
He had suffered in his life  
His wife and kids  
And boss and dogs  
And neighbors  
Raising cain and causing strife  
They were forever whining  
Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying  
Vavoom  
He fed them well  
He keep them warm  
  
Thing about Ted  
He didn't really care  
Nothing much got in his hair  
And the beauty of it was  
That he was right  
He was big as a truck  
And fast as a door  
(what's that?)  
He was always right  
  
The banjo player took a hike  
What's that song  
I used to like  
Vavoom  
He was big as a truck

Def Leppard,Beyond The Temple,/d/def+leppard/beyond+the+temple+78+demo_20164133.html,"Beyond the temple  
There lies a tomb with a king from long ago  
A traveler from a distant planet  
Ten thousand years or so  
The legend tells of an agin' man  
Whose city he built alone  
Till the pirates of our western world  
Tore it down stone by stone  
  
The clouds are gettin' heavy  
As he points unto the sky  
But with the guidance of his finger  
He let the lightning fly  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
He gathered up his people  
And he took them underground  
To the caves of silvery water  
Where they never could be found  
  
The king came to the surface  
Could not believe what he had found  
The temple left in ruins  
His city knocked to the ground  
  
He went back to his people  
Sad news he had to tell  
The only justice for the king  
Was to put these men in hell  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
His face showing sorrow  
His heart full of grief  
His life's work in ruins  
Destroyed by a thief  
  
His people just sit around  
His children just cry  
The king's mind is all confused  
Just wonderin' why  
  
The temple split in half  
And scattered through the desert  
The dust had risen in the air  
The race of people had to live in devastation  
Why wasn't he even there?  
  
Message from the gods to gather up his people  
The kingdom couldn't lose them there  
That's when all the gods and all are livin' peaceful  
Just a galaxy away  
  
The king rose up from underground  
To light the darkened sky  
Red lights, green lights, blue lights flashing  
It seemed a mile high  
  
As it lifted from the ground  
And soared into the air  
The king looked at what might have been  
A world that needed care  
  
A storm had risen quickly  
Across the take of hope  
Now there's no trace of the king  
Just a memory carved in stone  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price

There's danger in the air  
  
Can you feel it in the air?  
Danger (Such a strange emotion)  
Can you feel it in the air?  
  
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door  
His innocence he suffered for  
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right  
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true  
He's going underground to track that danger down  
Oh Billy, why you got that gun?  
  
Never give him an even break  
Gettin' caught is the chance you take  
It could be your last mistake  
(You could be so helpless)  
As a bird with a broken wing  
Like a sheep in a lion's den  
Gonna fall but you won't know when  
  
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall  
And the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall  
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late  
  
As the rain came down on the crimson ground  
It was the hand of fate  
And a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait

And raise a glass for all of us

And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid  
And turn her face away

That neither hands nor limbs would burst  
It's hard enough to keep formation  
Amid this fall out saturation  
  
Cursing at the Astronette 8  
Who stands in steel  
By his cabinet  
He's crashing out with Sylvian

If you want to know my feelings I'd say that's tough

On which the bandits thrive  
But we have the power of finding  
Illusion to keep us alive  
So through the valleys and over the hills

We'll fight until we lose our will

In the mornin' don't say you love me,  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor.  
  
Won't need too much pursuadin'  
I don't mean to sound degradin',  
But with a face like that you got nothin' to laugh about.  
Red lips, hair and fingernails,  
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my Tarot cards  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
  
So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne,  
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd gonna stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get out.

Like I believe it  
Oh no, it's not your fault  
You sit alone inside a room  
Wait for the world to come to you  
They never do  
  
It must be something that you can't let go  
It hurts that you won't let me know  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And then in conversation  
I love the way you mention  
Nothing's ever gone your way  
With a hammer in your hand  
You spell out a master plan  
We never learn  
  
It must be somebody holding your heart  
Something that tears us apart  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And I don't think that it's right  
To let love pass by  
Any time of life  
It's good to be alive  
  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
Yes, every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help what I feel  
But it sure feels real  
I wanna hold on to this moment  
Cause babe it sure feels right  
To be alive

I can't remember why  
Complete or justify my situation.  
  
I don't remember when and I can only half pretend,  
A case of now and then, I just need someone.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way but there?s the only way, lead the way.

I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I cant wait until tomorrow comes.  
  
Spoke out on compromise, just the ego telling lies.  
Confides and then defies, in case you?'re waiting.  
Guess that it's a time for change  
Remain but change the name.  
This game is where to aim.  
I hear the charge, boy.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way, but there?s the only way, lead the way.

It's liberating, but when it rains it pours,  
Degenerating, ain't gonna fight no more.  
  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down

Def Leppard,Too Late For Love,/d/def+leppard/too+late+for+love_20038941.html,"Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night  
There's a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love

Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue  
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Can't you see it's all too late  
It's too late  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love

While the others told of a final retribution  
A terrible revenge of the Gods  
But we understood the grand finale  
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before  
So all that was left was  
All the women were captured and chained  
And national suicide was proclaimed  
And new America fell to the ground  
And all the children lay crippled lame  
But all the nations came together  
In fear of the thought of the end  
No more would we fight in the streets  
No courage had we to defend  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place  
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race  
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend  
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end

Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more  
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor  
Could you open up your heart then close the door

All the tears you hide  
You die for love when it's alive  
But where does love go when it dies

Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die  
And is there room inside your mind for one more try  
And would it ever be enough

Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave  
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light  
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now

I called your cell phone, my love  
But you did not reply  
  
The world is ours if you want it  
We can take it, if you just take my hand  
There's no turning back now  
Baby try to understand  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know you're scared it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait to waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
When your lips are on my lips  
And our hearts beat as one  
But you slip out of my fingertips  
Every time you run  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know your scared it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait to waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
'Cause you been hurt before  
I can see it in your eyes  
You try to smile it away  
Some things you can't disguise  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Baby I can ease the ache, the ache  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break

You told me you never fall in love

And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

Stone cold, stone cold  
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore  
  
Stone cold, baby  
God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain  
Give me the truth, me and my heart  
We'll make it through  
If happy is her, I'm happy for you  
  
Hmmmm  
  
Stone cold, stone cold  
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone  
Stone cold, stone cold  
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold  
  
Stone cold, baby  
God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain  
Give me the truth, me and my heart  
We'll make it through  
If happy is her, I'm happy for you  
  
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone  
I wish I could mend this but here's my goodbye  
Oh, I'm happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand  
If happy is her, If happy is her  
I'm happy for you

Demi Lovato,Stronger,/d/demi+lovato/stronger_20736639.html,"The night is getting darker  
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us,  
Sing a song for me,  
Lift me higher with your words,  
Sing that cold melody.  
  
So follow me  
Onto the moonlit sidewalk  
And take my hand  
Grip it tighter, and don't let it go  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They only make us stronger.  
  
Did you feel that breeze?  
A tide of chills just swept over me  
It must of been from the brush of your hand  
Pull me into your arms  
A little closer baby  
I wanna see you standing  
Next to me  
  
So take a walk with me,  
But keep the pace down  
I don't want this night to end  
Can't we runaway together?  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word...  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind in the wind for them to choke on

Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

When she came into the picture  
You were always with her  
And she's not leaving.

And now she's your baby doll  
She drove you over,  
Over to break it off

Who's that, who's that  
  
I got my eyes on this boy  
Can't get him off my mind  
He's one of a kind  
The cherry to my pie  
I just wanna get him close  
  
Wanna make him mine  
Come hold my hand and dance away the night  
Give me the green light, kiss my lips  
Who's that boy watching my hips?  
I- I- I wanna know who you are  
My name is Dev and you can be my star

Oh he got me  
No, I've never seen,  
No one like him  
Damn he's everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Who's that boy, who's that boy

Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled

With no conscience, repentance, oh no  
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise  
Devils feed on the seeds of the soul  
  
I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real  
No mistaking the faking, I care  
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there  
On a note full of hope not despair

If all the judges missed the case  
  
In a parallel universe that's happening right now  
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how  
  
And everything could have been perfect  
Everything in the right place  
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect  
Accused, abandoned and disgraced  
  
I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger  
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer  
I heard the sound, i turned my head around  
To watch our love shot down  
  
In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side  
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide  
  
And everything is almost perfect  
Everything is almost right  
There are never any conflicts  
There are never any fights

The countless feasts laid at my feet  
Forbidden fruits for me to eat

Forgiveness for the things I do

Decency look down upon  
The scapegoat fate's made of me  
But I promise now, my judge and jurors  
My intentions couldn't have been purer  
My case is easy to see  
  
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience  
Peace of mind after what I've been through

A jurisdiction of love  
Enoughs not enough  
When love gets rough  
The jurisdiction of love  
Off their walls  
Just like Niagara Falls  
Logical thought  
Is no comfort  
It only makes the  
Matter seem worse  
Might equals right  
In connubial fight  
The jurisdiction of love  
Love equals war

Why fall in love when there's better things to do

Of devolutionary humans  
Who have waited so faithfully this past year  
While Devo gathered its strength  
For the next offensive  
  
As many of you can see  
The road ahead is filled with danger  
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear  
But the human mind itself  
  
Or lack of it on this planet  
It's time to go beyond the normal thing  
It's time to do the super thing  
It's time for Devo  
  
There is no question about it  
The spud boys are ready with  
New songs, new films and new approaches  
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans  
  
Lies, lies, lies  
That's all we get  
From those who pretend to know but don't  
But once again Devo attempts  
  
To cut through the mental grease and grime  
With techniques of positive mutation  
Designed to protect you  
From the ninnies and the twits  
  
Remember, no one knows  
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions  
That help point us all in the right direction  
To go forward, move ahead  
  
And give the past the slip  
It's time to seek out new traditions  
We know where the old one's took us  
And now we are all here together

Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit  
The vinyl record and cassette tape  
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings  
  
Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'  
To purchase, it is not like spending money  
But rather, it is an investment in the future  
In a blow against the empire

Dewa 19,Sweetest Place,/d/dewa+19/sweetest+place_10084506.html,"This is the sweetest place  
Baring my feeling  
I'm welcoming an eye  
Into the darkest one  
It tells me not to worry  
For the time is yet to come  
For someone to arrive  
And heal the troubled one  
Suddenly the rainfalls  
Showering a desert stone  
Wash away these tears of yesterday  
I hear the sound of  
A raising chorus  
Sung by the angels  
And the broken heroes  
I wont go back now I feel so right  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one  
And finally I don' t have to run  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one  
Become one

And whispered in my ear  
All night sweet words  
I never heard  
And I believed every word  
  
Next day you came my way  
Without a word to say you passed me by  
You didn't give an eye  
My darling won't you tell me why  
You're acting strange toward me  
Why have you changed toward me  
  
Are you just a breathtaking  
First sight soul-shaking  
One night love-making  
Next day heartbreaking guy  
  
That night your love was true  
The next day we were through  
Your love won't come  
And you were moving on  
And I was left to cry alone  
What have I done to you  
Was it just fun to you  
  
Are you just a breathtaking

One night love-making  
Next day heartbreaking guy

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better

That nothing can take your place of you being there

It ain't easy being green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think, I think it would be nicer being red  
Or yellow or gold  
  
You see, it ain't easy being green  
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And then, sometimes, sometimes people pass over you  
Because you're not standing out like sparkles on the water  
Or like the stars in the sky  
  
But did you know that green is the color of Spring  
And green can be big like an ocean  
And important like a mountain  
And cool and friendly-like  
Or tall and skinny like a tree  
And me  
  
But when green is all there is to be  
It kind of makes you wonder why  
Why wonder, wonder why?  
Hey, I'm green and I think it'll do fine

'Cause green is beautiful, baby

Diana Ross,Big Mable Murphy,/d/diana+ross/big+mable+murphy_20700591.html,"Way back in '29, 1929, somewhere in Coffeeville  
Was a Honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy  
She had a sweetheart, mean Little Melvin  
And hell would fly between them every Saturday night  
Why? Because Little Melvin, he got wild on bathtub gin  
Well, it made him feel like he was almost twice his size  
So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable  
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes  
Ya see, Big Mable Murphy, she loved her Little Melvin  
But he never did learn to do just what she said  
'Cause poor Little Melvin, woke up early every morning  
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Late one rainy night, Scarface, muscle and all might  
He came in and started shoving everybody around  
Well, Big Mable Murphy, she was way back in the kitchen  
So just for fun, ol' Scarface shot Little Melvin down  
Early next morning, down by the river  
They say, old Scarface was found real short of breath  
They say, he died, uhh, oh, the man died from a good ol' whipping  
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Big Mable, Big Mable Murphy  
She gave him two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head

Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
There on the front page was a picture  
Of a crowd as they watched a parade passing by  
And through the haze of last nights sleep  
Something familiar caught my eye  
  
There was a couple looking so much in love, yes  
They had a front line view  
And as I pulled the paper closer  
I realized standing next to her it was you  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Now I know why you've been working late each night  
And no longer have desire to ever hold me tight  
And your busy, busy schedule was all a lie  
Oh, even the dream with a bonus, oh just another alibi

How can that possibly be  
Maybe you can show me why

I remember your touch without it  
Let me drown in your ecstasy  
It's got to be do or die  
  
Don't tell me love is just one night

And one way or the other, we can find  
Another world we can run away to

Experience, is only what you make it  
You live forever but you never know  
That somebody loves you  
And when the sky is open  
Fly away lovers can share  
I'll be there  
  
And you can make the earth move  
You can take me with no struggle  
Lead me through your mystical dreams  
Show me what you are  
And we can make the wind blow  
You're the power and I'm in it  
You can be the fire I start  
I want your heart  
  
And let there be a story when the stories are told  
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls  
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure  
You can not ignore

Diana Ross,Home,/d/diana+ross/home_20040380.html,"When I think of home  
I think of a place where there's love overflowing  
I wish I was home  
I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing  
  
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning  
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning  
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean  
  
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there  
Now that I have some direction  
It would sure be nice to be back home  
Where there's love and affection  
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up  
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up  
Time be my friend, let me start again  
  
Suddenly my world has changed it's face  
But I still know where I'm going  
I have had my mind spun around in space  
And yet I've watched it growing  
  
If you're list'ning God  
Please don't make it hard to know  
If we should believe in the things that we see  
Tell us, should we run away  
Should we try and stay  
Or would it be better just to let things be?  
  
Living here, in this brand new world  
Might be a fantasy  
But it taught me to love  
So it's real, real to me  
  
And I've learned  
That we must look inside our hearts  
To find a world full of love  
Like yours  
Like me  
  
Like home...

I put him off with lies  
He could see I had no eyes  
So he left me once again alone  
Like a child without her playmate  
I had to face the truth

'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I say they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
I stood there, numb  
Watchin' my friend walk away

""Sorry for what I had to do  
But you see I love him just as much as you.""

Keep an eye

The devil's workshop is a busy place  
On top of evil there's an innocent face  
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart  
  
Kindness was a thread  
She used to weave my world apart  
There were three of us seen all over town  
Now there's only two  
Someone's missing  
Guess who?  
  
Now I see how she schemed  
And worked her way in between  
Planted seeds of mistrust  
To make us fight unaware  
Her comforting ways when I would cry  
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  
Just like a snake on the limb tree  
A friend is an enemy you can see  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I said they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
So you better keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
Don't trust nobody  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
Keep an eye  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend

I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum  
My father left, he never even married mom

Is worth the pain of waiting  
We'll only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating

Love child, always second best  
Love child, different from the rest

To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Don't think that I don't need you  
Don't think I don't want to please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing  
The name of shame I've been wearing

I knew the day we started  
That we were meant to be  
If only you'd let me!  
I've cried so many tears  
Gotta face now all my fears  
We let time slip away  
I need you boy  
Here today!  
  
There was so much you gave me  
To my heart  
To my soul  
There was so much of your dreams  
That were never told  
You had so much hope  
For a brighter day  
Why were you my flower  
Plucked away  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns

Diana Ross,More And More,/d/diana+ross/more+more_20040143.html,"Have I ever been here before  
I remember hearing your name, sir  
If my conversation lacks discretion  
It's the same old foolish game  
  
Did I ever give you my key  
Did you ever walk through my door, sir  
You may not be one of my possessions  
But I need you more and more  
  
I finally acquired what other people live on  
I always took what I could find  
But on that lucky night  
I found me loving you  
And the best thing you can do  
is to fall in love with  
  
I can feel the glow when we kiss  
I don't have the strength to resist you  
You must have lit a fire in my heart  
'Cause I need you more and more  
  
I'm resting in your arms  
And dancing in the moonlight  
My emotions are on display  
And if I don't see your face  
Or feel you in my fingers  
I would have to try  
To get by with someone like  
  
You relax while I make you warm  
And into your trap I will fall, sir  
I gave my last position  
On the chance to see you more  
To love you more and more  
And more...

When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent  
And all you've got to give him  
Is the use of your side-show tent  
Yes and that's all that remains of the years  
Spent doing to rounds

Well it just comes pouring down

You can't complain about the rules  
You know what they say about beggars  
You know who's the first to blame his tools

And leave lying bleeding on the ground  
You screw people over on the way up  
Because you thought that you were never coming down  
And he takes you out in vaudeville valley  
With his hand up smothering your screams  
And he screws you down in tin pan alley  
In the city of a billion dreams

Your footsteps are forbidden  
But with a knowledge of your sin  
You throw your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
And you go dancing through doorways  
Just to see what you will find  
Leaving nothing to interfere  
With the crazy balance of your mind  
And when you finally reappear  
At the place where you came in  
You've thrown your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
It takes love over gold  
And mind over matter  
To do what you do that you must  
When the things that you hold  
Can fall and be shattered  
Or run through your fingers like dust

Every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne  
I get the same old feeling  
Every time I'm moving down the line  
Southbound again last night I felt like crying  
Right now I'm sick of living  
But I'm going to keep on trying.

Just keep it real partner give to the needy  
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait  
Fuck around and I'm go'a bite you and snatch the plate  
  
[dmx]  
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe  
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo  
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen  
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams  
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me  
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever  
The closest thing to me is gonna get it  
But, never will I, can I think death is wrong  
So i'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone  
You could put that on my nigga boone  
These other rap cats will give a nigga room  
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door  
Headhuntin mother fuckers, stay on the floor  
4-4, that's what I get sick wit rrrrrrr  
Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr

I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift  
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff  
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone  
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone  
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife  
Scratch, shake, and hold all night  
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin  
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin  
But I don't like drama so I say to myself,  
""keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth  
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses  
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses""  
I'm broke so i'ma bash his head wide open  
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin  
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat  
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black

[dmx]  
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf  
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help  
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside  
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside  
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots, faggot  
You've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops  
One drops, and another and another  
Gun pops, go into you and your mother  
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog  
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue  
Many questions, no answers, just stress  
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed  
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by  
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, why ask why when you know  
Nigga when it's your time to go, you go

South of the river you stop and you hold everything  
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time  
You feel alright when you hear the music ring  
  
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces  
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down  
Competition in other places  
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound  
Way on downsouth

Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords  
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing  
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford  
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing  
  
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene  
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright  
He can play the honky tonk like anything  
Savin' it up, for Friday night  
With the Sultans  
We're the Sultans of Swing  
  
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner  
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles  
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band  
It ain't what they call rock and roll

Goodnight, now it's time to go home

Dire Straits,Telegraph Road,/d/dire+straits/telegraph+road_20040667.html,"A long time ago came a man on a track  
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further, and they never went back  
Then came the churches, then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines, then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
There's six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down  
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found  
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed  
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care  
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane  
I've seen desperation explode into flames  
And I don't want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road

It's all takin' and no givin'  
  
They just use your mind  
And they never give you credit  
It's enough to drive you  
Crazy if you let it

For service and devotion  
You would think that I  
Would deserve a fat promotion  
  
Want to move ahead  
But the boss won't seem to let me  
I swear sometimes that man is  
Out to get me, hmmm  
  
They let you dream  
Just a watch 'em shatter  
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder  
But you got dreams he'll never take away  
  
In the same boat with a lot of your friends  
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in  
And the tide's gonna turn  
And it's all gonna roll you away  
  
Workin' 9 to 5  
What a way to make livin'  
Barely gettin' by  
It's all takin' and no givin'

And you never get the credit  
It's enough to drive you  
Crazy if you let it  
  
9 to 5  
Yeah, they got you were they want you  
There's a better life  
And you think about it, don't you?  
  
It's a rich man's game  
No matter what they call it  
And you spend your life  
Putting money in his wallet  
  
9 to 5

There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile  
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile  
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand  
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand  
Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs  
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony  
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
All life has to offer that's what most folks desire  
But offer nothing in return, cause they don't seem to care  
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs  
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony

Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do  
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose  
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool  
She swears she never knew but always needed to  
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose  
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most  
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees  
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
To sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"" are words that just don't come  
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  
But his eyes keep tellin' her ""you know I love you anyway  
No matter what I say or what I never say""  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
And sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
He's just a fool that must defend his honor  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways

Except the memories from the past

In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky  
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day  
And I considered myself as lucky  
When he told me he would take me away  
And though he was older, it made me no difference  
His promise of riches was all I could see  
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky  
And know something better than sad poverty  
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you  
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see  
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'  
But I'll always hold you in my memory  
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'  
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me  
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky  
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me  
He won't let my family and friends come to visit  
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed  
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them  
All that's changed about me is my name  
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you  
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore  
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy  
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before  
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky  
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win  
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me  
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again  
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it  
It's my last request and he can't refuse me  
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky  
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me  
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you  
But different from the way you remember me before  
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest  
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore  
I'll sleep in your arms forever more

Dolly Parton,Blue Valley Songbird,/d/dolly+parton/blue+valley+songbird_20041673.html,"She was born in a place called Blue Valley  
At the foot of the Tennessee hills  
With the blue birds and blue bells  
And blue mountain water  
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill  
But there was no peace in the valley  
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man  
Used and abused her mind and her body  
So her mama said run while you can  
So at fifteen she took to the highway  
Belongings and guitar in hand  
And she buried herself in her music  
The one thing she did understand  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet  
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound  
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it  
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around  
  
She hopes someday she will make it  
And everyone says that she will  
When she comes to town, crowds flock around  
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills  
She writes her letter back home to her mama  
In care of the preacher in town  
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church  
And so her daddy cannot track her down  
  
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby  
Whenever she turns off the lights  
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy  
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry  
  
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac  
A band dressed in blue by her side  
Instruments tied to the top and the back  
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by  
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries  
Expressing the feelings she holds inside  
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight

I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master  
So I left the one that loved me all along  
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  
Didn't care about the grief I left behind  
Didn't even make a card or write a letter  
So sure I'd be successful in no time  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  
How what you have is never good enough  
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up  
Well the seasons came, they went  
The dreams all shattered  
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered  
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'  
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels

You leave 'em laughing when you go

Turned to hell  
The same old hurt  
We know so well  
And something's got  
To change  
We both know it's got to end  
The passion's gone  
It's just pretend  
And one of us have got  
To make the move  
We might as well just give it up  
We've lost respect and  
There's no trust  
And without this, there's  
No real love  
It's just some sad excuse  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And there's nothing left but walk away  
Ain't this a crying shame  
A change of pace  
A change of heart  
A change of place  
A place to start  
And we'll be better off apart  
Our only chance is change  
And we never wil  
But something has to change  
But someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Then I will try to be your friend again  
But I don't want to see  
Your face 'til then  
Change, I need a change  
I need a change  
We need a change

To stay away from each other's arms

Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road  
I once loved a man but that love grew old  
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good away, babe  
So I'm gonna say farewell  
  
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind  
But you just kinda wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice, it's alright

I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing  
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me  
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over  
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying  
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
Down from Dover

I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure  
This morning when I opened my eyes  
There to my surprise  
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream  
And so I said a little prayer  
And thanked God, that he was there  
Oh, this is a dream come true  
Dream do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But now I do  
Dreams do come true  
It was love at first sight  
And it was love all night  
And the way he made love to me  
Fulfilled all my fantasies  
Ooo, this is a dream come true  
Yes, dreams do come true

But you're living proof  
That dreams do come true

Dolly Parton,Evening Shade,/d/dolly+parton/evening+shade_20041829.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground

Dolly Parton,God's Coloring Book,/d/dolly+parton/gods+coloring+book_20041645.html,"Today as I was walking  
In the fields just down the way  
I sat down on a fallen log  
To pass the time away  
And as I looked around me  
The more that I did look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
I saw a golden ray of sunlight  
A silver drop of dew  
A soft, white floating cloud  
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue  
A yellow dandelion  
Pretty evergreen  
And some red and orange flowers  
Growing wild along the stream  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
The greyness in an old man's hair  
The pink in baby's cheeks  
The blackness in a stormy sky  
The brown in fallen leaves  
And the multicolored rainbow  
Stretched out across the sky  
And the purple haze at sunset  
Just before the night  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
Then I turn my face toward the sky  
And say a silent prayer  
Though God doesn't speak to me  
I see him everywhere  
He is all around me  
He's everywhere I look  
And each new day is but a new page  
In god's coloring book

Each new day is but a new page

I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy

Dolly Parton,"Gypsy, Joe And Me",/d/dolly+parton/gypsy+joe+me_20041716.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  
And quenched our thirst with rain  
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me  
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back  
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need  
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me  
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch  
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit  
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul  
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know  
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride  
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life  
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery  
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me  
Well the winter came and the snow did fall  
And the night was cold and still  
And the rags we wore were not enough  
And Joe he caught the chill  
And he told me how he loved me  
And in my arms he went to sleep  
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me  
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge  
Lookin' down I see  
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me  
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me  
Tonight we'll be together again  
Gypsy, Joe and me

And all the windows fastened down  
I spent the night in sleeplessness  
And rose at every sound  
Half in hope of sorrow  
And half in fear the day  
Would find the soldiers breakin' through  
To drag us all away  
And just before the sunrise  
I heard something at the wall  
The gate began to rattle  
And a voice began to call  
I hurried to the window  
Looked down into the street  
Expecting swords and torches  
And the sound of soldiers' feet  
  
But there was no one there but Mary  
So I went down to let her in  
John stood there beside me  
As she told me where she'd been  
She said they've moved Him in the night  
And none of us know where  
The stone's been rolled away  
And now His body isn't there  
  
We both ran towards the garden  
Then John ran on ahead  
We found the stone and empty tomb  
Just the way that Mary said  
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in  
Was just an empty shell  
And how or where they'd taken Him  
Was more than I could tell  
  
Oh something strange had happened there  
Just what I did not know  
John believed a miracle  
But I just turned to go  
Circumstance and speculation  
Couldn't lift me very high  
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him  
Then I saw Him die  
  
Back inside the house again  
The guilt and anguish came  
Everything I'd promised Him  
Just added to my shame  
When at last it came to choices  
I denied I knew His name  
And even if He was alive  
It wouldn't be the same  
  
But suddenly the air was filled  
With a strange and sweet perfume  
Light that came from everywhere  
Drove shadows from the room  
And Jesus stood before me  
With His arms held open wide  
And I fell down on my knees  
And I just clung to Him and cried  
  
Then He raised me to my feet  
And as I looked into His eyes  
The love was shining out from Him  
Like sunlight from the skies  
Guilt in my confusion  
Disappeared in sweet release  
And every fear I ever had  
Just melted into peace  
  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive  
Hallelujah He's alive  
He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive He's alive  
I believe it He's alive

I only know it's real  
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you
