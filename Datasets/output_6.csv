Elvis Presley,A Big Hunk O' Love,/e/elvis+presley/a+big+hunk+o+love_20048096.html,"Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you  
No no no no no no no no  
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do  
  
Don't be a stingy little mama  
You're 'bout to starve me half to death  
Now you can spare a kiss or two  
And still have plenty left  
  
Oh no no baby  
I ain't askin' much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do  
That's right  
  
You're just a natural born beehive  
Filled with honey to the top  
But I ain't greedy baby  
All I want is all you got  
  
Oh no no  
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do  
That's right  
  
I got a wishbone in my pocket  
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist  
I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring  
If you give me just a one sweet kiss  
  
Oh no no no no no no no no  
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you  
Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do

Then I must believe wishes come true

There would be this magic moment,  
One to last a lifetime through  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you  
  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you

Elvis Presley,A Whistling Tune,/e/elvis+presley/a+whistling+tune_20047916.html,"Did you ever notice when the sun goes down  
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze  
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
And the murmuring waters sing the song  
The echoing mountains hum along  
The whispering valleys fill the air  
With a whistling tune our hearts can share  
It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon  
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night

I never thought I could, but now I know  
The sound of the old train whistle  
Makes me want to cry  
Reminds me of that lonely feeling  
When I said goodbye  
  
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now

To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight  
  
Don't want a silver dollar  
Rabbit's foot on a string  
The happiness in your warm caress  
No rabbit's foot can bring  
  
Come on and be my little good luck charm  
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight  
I want a good luck charm  
A-hanging on my arm  
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight  
  
I found a lucky penny  
I'd toss it across the bay  
Your love is worth all the gold on earth  
No wonder that I say

As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa  
Down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly  
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly  
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me  
At four gray walls that surround me  
And I realize I was only dreamin'  
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again  
I'll touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old tree  
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home

Elvis Presley,Guitar Man,/e/elvis+presley/guitar+man_20049663.html,"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,  
Left my mama a goodbye note,  
By sundown I'd left Kingston,  
With my guitar under my coat,  
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,  
Got a room at the YMCA,  
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,  
Just lookin' for a place to play,  
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,  
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.  
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,  
I run outta money and luck,  
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,  
On a overloaded poultry truck,  
I thumbed on down to Panama City,  
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,  
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,  
Makin' music on my guitar,  
I got the same old story at them all night piers,  
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man  
We don't need a guitar man, son  
So I slept in the hobo jungles,  
Roamed a thousand miles of track,  
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,  
At a club they call Big Jack's,  
A little four-piece band was jammin',  
So I took my guitar and I sat in,  
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,  
With a swingin' little guitar man.  
Show 'em, son  
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,  
Find yourself down around Mobile,  
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,  
If you got a little time to kill,  
Just follow that crowd of people,  
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,  
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,  
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,  
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,  
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

That I used as an excuse

You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it  
I don't promote violence I just encourage it  
I laugh at the sight of death  
As I fall down a cement flight of steps  
And land inside a bed of spider webs  
So throw caution to the wind

Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again

But I'm more toward droppin an accapella  
And choppin' a fella  
To mozarella  
Worse than a hellacopta propella  
Got you locked in the cella  
With your skeleton showing  
Developing anorexia  
While I'm standin next to ya  
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death  
With an iv in your veins  
Feeding you liquid darvicet  
Pumping you full of drugs  
Pull the plugs  
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
Who were picked up in an ambulance  
And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
And given  
A less than 20 percent chance  
Of living  
Have a possible placement  
It's a hospital patient  
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement  
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived  
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!""  
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth  
Better call the fire department  
I've hired a arson  
To set fire to carpet  
And burn up your entire apartment  
I'm a liar to start shit [?]  
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick  
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit  
  
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg  
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40  
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D  
fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas  
Cross the bombas [?]  
We blowin up your house killing your parents  
And coming back to get your foster mommas  
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets  
I'm more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more cause I smoked crack [?]  
Today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra

Man stop! Man said, ""Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya

Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.  
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,  
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.  
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks,  
""Mista, help me""'s what he said to me, and then sunk.  
Women, skinnin' them and cuttin' them up in chunks,  
In clumps, the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.

Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways  
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.  
How the hell did he fit, em all into such a small place?  
Hide em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?  
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait.  
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.  
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint  
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.  
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin' from within.  
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',  
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.  
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?  
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.  
Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.  
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.

Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?  
Nothin', so chill.  
Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.  
Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.  
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,  
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel  
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,  
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!  
I keep hearin' voices, like ""Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,  
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?""  
""In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a  
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are.""

Hurry, hurry, step right up!  
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now  
So without further ado, I bring to you  
  
Marshall!  
  
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless  
Most hardest, most honest, known artist  
Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden  
With his own private plane, his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)  
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes  
Yeah, here I come  
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business  
I don't got no time to play around what is this?  
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down  
On these clowns, can I get a witness?  
Hell Yeah!  
  
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best  
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it  
Flows too wet, nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
There's no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin' and you know what for  
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all  
To Marshall and Andre's carnival  
Come on! Now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo  
Two old friends, why panic?  
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect, the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat  
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy  
Jesus, how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me  
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V  
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy  
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me  
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains  
Nothin' but clowns down here  
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here  
Yo Dre!  
What up?  
Can I get a hell yeah?  
Hell Yeah!

So there you have it folks  
Marshall!  
Has come to save the day  
Back with his friend Andre  
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay  
Because  
Marshall!  
And Andre are here to stay and never go away  
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray  
Marshall!  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair, same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening

Eminem,Careful What You Wish For,/e/eminem/careful+what+you+wish+for_20793604.html,"So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isn't how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shit'd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin' it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldn't quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no in-between  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three  
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The Marshall Mathers was a classic  
The Eminem Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet  
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic  
And eight years later, I'm still at it  
Divorce, re-married  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke, and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I got a letter from a fan, that said  
He's been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
It's been weighing on my mind heavy  
'Cause I don't read every  
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but  
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?  
You didn't pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where I'm at  
I've already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got  
God on my side  
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?  
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint  
Man, boy's got to look  
Nuts  
And that's the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
'Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just  
Come back on you ten-fold

I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against

Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'  
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'  
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening  
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth

So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73  
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' C-D  
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye

Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human  
But I'm man enough to face them today!  
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause I'd a killed them, shit I woulda shot Kim and him both

Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'  
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't  
'Til I grew up, now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it?  
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?  
Well guess what your gettin' older now and  
It's cold when your lonely and Nathan's growin' up so quick  
He's gonna know that your phony  
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her she's beautiful  
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!  
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong  
Bitch, do your song  
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get  
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?

If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his f-cking name feinting  
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle  
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?  
I noticed there's so many of them  
And there's really not that many of us.

It's on till the break of dawn  
And we're starting this party from dusk  
  
OK, let's go  
  
Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk  
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.  
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.  
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.  
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time  
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes  
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.  
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal  
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre  
  
[Dr. Dre]  
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!  
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why.  
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.  
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.  
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.  
Cause over and above all, it's just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends.  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.  
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Let's cash that one in.  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know.  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?  
Decisions, decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision.  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!  
  
It's bottle after bottle  
The money ain't a thing when you party with me  
It's what we into it's simple  
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe  
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong  
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on  
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm  
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want  
Nigga on and on till the break of what  
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck  
I spend it like it don't mean nothing  
Blow it like its supposed to be blown  
Motherfucker I'm grown  
I stunt I style I flash the shit  
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick  
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes  
I say move a bitch move

That's how dudes be gettin' sick  
That's how dicks be gettin' drips  
Fallin' victims to this shit  
From these bitches on our dicks  
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs  
That's why I ain't got no time  
  
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk  
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk  
Pussy residue was on my penis  
Denise from the cleaners  
Fucked me good, you should of seen us  
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable,  
French role stylin', body like a Stallion  
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigga  
Debatin' on to fuck, or do I wanna be a nigga  
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits  
Sippin' on that fine shit  
I ain't use to buyin'  
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory  
Like takin' ho's money, but that's anutha story  
For surely ya pussy on toast, after we toast  
her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice  
The womb beata', clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock  
In that spot hotta' than the hottest block, don't stop!  
Response I got when I was knockin' it  
Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'  
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans  
I gotta slow down before I cum soon  
And work that nigga, like a slave owna'  
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her  
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips  
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip  
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though  
Pussy tighta' than conditions of us black folks  
we in the final stretch, the last part of sex  
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next  
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?  
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated  
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected  
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit  
Fuck

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'  
Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach  
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er  
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force  
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort  
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?  
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?  
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore  
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce  
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours  
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'  
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips  
When you get back to Michigan  
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse  
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse  
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get  
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick  
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it  
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha  
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS  
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it  
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho  
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo  
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow  
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?  
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleanas

I'll meet you down there  
  
[Chorus]  
There once was a saying that I used to say  
Back in the day when I met Dre  
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof  
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof  
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him  
That's not happening, that I can't fathom  
Eighty something million records worldwide later,  
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator  
  
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady  
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me  
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele  
Woopsa that a fucking daisy  
That's a no-no who even she knows Dada's fucking crazy  
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B  
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me  
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby  
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up  
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters  
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner  
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does  
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started  
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of  
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust  
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it fake it  
They get so mad, when I call them both fagots  
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it  
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it  
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing  
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination  
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation  
Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-  
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him  
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass Doctor Dre some  
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son  
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son  
I can't believe I leave for one brief second  
And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked  
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it  
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later  
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave  
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em  
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em  
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street  
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep  
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep  
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep  
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?  
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy  
This is my house, all nine thousand feet  
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth  
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top  
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop  
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop  
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit  
This must be all that there is, this must be it  
Fuckin'-A even got a bidet  
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper  
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off  
I can just toss a flying saucer in it  
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator

Get familiar wit it  
  
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homie's verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed, became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin' and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
That's why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin' the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and ain't spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
[Verse 2: Eminem]  
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin' its a fuckin' mimick when it ain't  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus (Uranus)  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein' crazed  
You don't think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And I've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed  
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts  
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!  
And now what do I do?  
Where do I go?  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
It's hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me it's sane  
And I like it, why? 'cause I feel like we're still united  
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!  
It's like that!? after all the crap we been through!?  
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!  
You keep sending me to voicemail!  
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips  
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!  
You're hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself, yeah, I did it  
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that  
You're so cold you just hit me so low  
I can't take this no more, so hit the road  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just don't seem the way they do  
One day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I can't get you outta of my head  
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I can't do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
What's on my mind and what's going through it  
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching I'm medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

What is life?  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends?  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies, with secret identities  
And disguises, to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'  
  
What is money?  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Money'll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life?  
I'm tired of life  
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
I'm tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off  
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
I'm tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand,  
I'd make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on,  
While I'm on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldn't be enough,  
Because I'd still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
I'm tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a B-M  
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me  
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me  
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of J-L-be saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john  
  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
You know what I'm saying?  
I'm tired of all of this bullshit  
Telling me to be positive  
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
I rap about shit around me, shit I see  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
Right now I'm tired of everything  
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city  
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?  
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?  
Just fed up

How the hell did he manage  
To get more felony charges?  
He's already got life in jail  
Man, what the hell is his problem?  
  
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic  
They compelled me  
To kill this elderly man  
  
And I get these panic attacks  
Pop a xanax, relax  
Try to stick my fucking dick  
Inside a mannequins ass  
  
Then I get manic depressed  
And the orthodontist get gas masked  
Kick ass  
The first thing I'll put on is the mask  
  
Speaking of masks, man  
It ain't to late to have a change of pace  
And take it off and show my face  
So you can see the things you face  
And slice you up  
And cook you after your murder  
By strangulation  
  
that's bacon souffle  
You making ain't you  
Well thank you jason  
  
There goes one more coma  
Due to blunt force trauma  
Just give me one more soma  
And I'll be done for it mama  
  
Go in the damn broom closet  
Another valium lost it  
Shovin the vacuums nozzle  
Down the bathroom faucet  
  
It seems like every day I get a little flakier  
The medication is making my hands a little shakier  
Hand me that 18 month old baby  
To shake him up  
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea  
Breaking his neck in 80 some places  
  
Baby here shady comes lady  
He's got the razor ba-blades and the cha-cha-chainsaw-saw baby  
You be-be-blundering bumbling m-m-mumbling dumm dumms  
Yeah, here I come come you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum  
  
there's something inside of that blue tarp  
And that drum drum  
A head and torso of someone  
Where'd it come from?  
  
Who's it belong to  
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair  
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms  
Clearly there's some'n wrong  
'Cause she didn't come home  
  
she's missing  
Where is she  
Something fishy is going on  
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs  
  
Now everybody get your dance on

To get your brain relaxing, a zany acting maniac in action  
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction  
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run  
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills

I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants  
Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects  
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up  
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog  
This is the season for noise pollution contamination  
Examination of more cartoons than animation  
My lamination of narration  
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense  
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse  
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans

My coil hands around this microphone are lethal  
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people  
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium  
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one  
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator  
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus  
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases  
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces  
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis  
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally  
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O  
So I'm assuming all responsibility  
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's  
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical  
I'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine  
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit  
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit

The roses have faded, there's frost at my door  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore

Each vow was a plaything that he threw away.

Love hunters in the night

Out where the pines grow wild and tall  
I was trying to make it home through the forest  
Before the darkness falls  
I heard the wind rustling through the trees  
And ghostly voices rose from the fields  
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path  
With the devil snappin' at my heels  
I broke through the trees, and there in the night  
My father's house stood shining hard and bright  
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms  
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms  
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart  
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts  
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride  
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light  
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch  
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door  
I told her my story, and who I'd come for  
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""  
My father's house shines hard and bright  
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night  
Calling and calling, so cold and alone

Emmylou Harris,My Name Is Emmett Till,/e/emmylou+harris/my+name+is+emmett+till_20974395.html,"I was born a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
I walked this earth for fourteen years  
Then one night I was killed  
For speaking to a woman  
Whose skin was as white as dough  
That's a sin in Mississippi  
But how was I to know  
  
I'd come down from Chicago  
To visit with my kin  
Up there I was a cheeky kid  
I guess I always been  
But the harm they put upon me  
Was too hard for what I done  
For I was just a black boy  
I never hurt no one  
  
They took me from my uncle's house  
Mose Wright was his name  
He'd later stand and without hesitation  
Point the blame  
At the ones who beat and cut me  
And shot me with a gun  
Then threw me in the river  
Like I was trash when they were done  
  
I was sent back to my mother  
At least what was left of me  
She kept my casket open  
For the whole wide world to see  
The awful desecration  
And the evidence of hate  
You could not recognize me  
The mutilation was so great  
  
There came a cry for justice then  
To be finally fulfilled  
All because of me, a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
  
But I'd have rather lived  
'Til I was too old to die young  
Not miss all I left behind  
All that might have come  
The summer clouds above my head  
The grass beneath my feet  
The warmth of a good woman  
Her kisses soft and sweet  
  
Perhaps to be a father  
With a black boy of my own  
And watch him grow into  
A kinder world than I had known  
  
Where no child would be murdered  
For the color of his skin  
And love would be the only thing  
Inside the hearts of men  
  
They say the horror of that night  
Is still haunting heaven still  
Where I am one more black boy  
My name is Emmett Till

My songbird wants her freedom  
Now don't you think I know  
  
But I can't find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just can't let her go

Peers into my soul  
O lord, I am overcome with shame  
Take me lord and purify  
Heal me with a word  
Lord, I beg a gift I dare not claim

And all the many times I've cried.

Nobody ever moved that the move you do  
  
You make my pants wanna get up and dance  
You make my face wanna grin  
You make my knees, kneel down, say please  
Honey, won't you kiss me again?  
  
Honey, won't you kiss me?  
Honey, won't you kiss me?  
Honey, won't you kiss me again?

I never meant to make you cry,

Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?  
No I don't, I don' t know  
I don't know,  
No I don't know

It's driving me insane, to know how much you hurt tonight,

I'd rather hurt you honestly, then mislead you with a lie

I'm only just beginning to see the real you  
  
Chours:  
Sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much  
and I have to close my eyes and hide,  
I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry  
I wanna hold you until the fear in me subsides  
  
Romance and all its' strategies, leaves me battling with my pride  
but through the insecurity some tenderness survives  
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truth  
a hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth

At times I'd like to break through, and hold you endlessly

Can't you see  
You've been changing the world around me - I know  
(I never wanna let you go)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
Can't deny  
Since I met you that day I've been blind - to see  
(Now I wanna know for real)  
  
Inside me  
I'm afraid to wake up from a dream - and see  
(It never really happent to me)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart

Enya,As Baile,/e/enya/as+baile_20156831.html,"Intonation  
The title ""As Baile"" can be translated as ""away from home"".  
The song itself is all intonation, although you might say the intonation is
""based"" in Irish Gaelic. Enya sings ""or, horo, mo-ray he u way, he u way"" and
so on. The word ""or"" is an interjection that could be translated as ""oh!"" or
""oho!"", but the rest of the song is intonation.

In his overtime  
He's no saint I know  
As he goes around the town  
Watch him cry himself to sleep

So I'm gonna do just what I want to anyway,  
And don't care if you all despise me.  
  
If I should take a notion  
To jump into the ocean,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
If I go to church on Sunday  
And I shimmy down on Monday,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
And if my friend ain't got no money  
And I say, ""All right, take all of mine honey,""  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
If I lend her my last nickel  
And it leaves me in a pickle,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
I would rather my gal would hit me  
Than to haul right up and quit me.  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
I know that she won't call no copper  
If she gets beat up by her poppa.  
It ain't nobody's business if I do, Lord no.  
Well, it ain't nobody's business if I do.

Took off his jacket, said, ""The night is short""  
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart  
  
He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you""  
""Rave on, cats"", he cried  
""It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried""  
  
Well, Dan got happy and he started raving  
He pulled out a razor but he wasn't shaving  
And all the cats knew to jump and hop  
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop  
  
He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you""  
""Rave on, cats"", he cried  
""It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried""  
  
Well, the cops heard Dan when he started to shout  
They all ran in to see what it was about  
And I heard him holler as they led him away  
He turned his head and this is what he had to say  
  
He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you""  
""Rave on, cats"", he cried  
""It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried""  
  
Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw  
He let us all know, he wasn't scared of the law  
The black dog barked, but the boy didn't flinch  
He said, ""It ain't my fault, hon, that I been pinched""  
  
He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with you""  
""Rave on, cats"", he cried  
""It's almost dawn, the cops are gone

Under the mistletoe we'd kiss

While the carolers are singing  
And bells would be ringing  
Because of all the love that you've been giving

For my wonderful season

Who's eyes can be so private and so proud  
No one's allowed to see them when they cry  
She maybe the love that cannot last  
May come from shadows of the past  
That I remember until the day I die  
  
She maybe the reason I survive  
The why and wherefore I'm alive  
The one I care for through the rough  
Me, I take her laughter and her tears  
And make them all my souvenirs  
For where she goes I've got to be  
The meaning of my life is she

Someday the light will break through

You can hear the music  
Of the AM radio  
  
The VCR and the DVD  
There was none of that crap  
Back in 1970  
We didn't know about a  
World Wide Web  
It was a whole different game  
Playin' back when  
I was a kid  
  
Want to get down in a cool way  
Picture yourself on a beautiful day  
Big bell bottoms and groovy long hair  
Just walkin' in style with a portable CD player  
No you'd listen to the music on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
  
Flashback, 72  
Another summer in the neighborhood  
Hanging out with nothing to do  
Sometimes we go driving around  
In my sister's pinto  
Cruising with the windows rolled down  
We listen to the radio station  
We were too damn cool  
To buy the eight track tape  
There wasn't any good time  
To want to be inside  
My mama want to watch that TV  
All goddamn night  
  
I'd be in bed with the radio on  
I would listen to it all night long  
Just to hear my favorite song  
You'd have to wait till you could hear it on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
I can still hear Mama say  
""Boy turn that radio down!""  
  
(Spoken ""Aw, Mom. Not that show again! I don't want to watch that show! Can't
we watch Good Times or Chico and the Man or something cool? Turn it off!)  
  
Things changed back in '75  
We were all growing up on the in and the outside  
We got in trouble with the police man  
We got busted getting high in the back of my friend's van  
I remember 1977  
I started going to concerts and I saw the Led Zeppelin  
I got a guitar on Christmas day  
I dreamed that Jimmy Page would come to  
Santa Monica to teach me to play  
Teach me to play  
  
There isn't any place that I need to go  
There isn't anything that I need to know  
That I did not learn on the radio  
  
Everything gets stupid and I just don't know  
Where to find my happy I listen to my music on the  
AM radio AM radio

Seven months of living sweaty  
On those thin white lines

I broke him into pieces, set them on fire  
Swept him under my bed  
I never learned how to play nice with all the other kids  
I never learned how to draw inside the lines and probably never will

Now close your eyes and jump to a place you attain to be  
And you can tell me what it feels like

Yeah, I be the extraordinary

Tell me where the party at, I'll be there  
Let her hit the coney at, show her where to rock the pony at  
  
I be the man with the large amounts of sapphire fare  
I'm about to cut loose my dog so you all best beware  
You can dance with flare and get out of your chair  
We be smarter than your average boo boo bear

Everlast,Get Down,/e/everlast/get+down_20052147.html,"I see everybody rockin' the same old style  
And everyone's sportin' the same profile  
And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands  
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams  
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands  
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands  
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be  
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three  
For every emcee that wannaa test and try  
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly  
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains  
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains  
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed  
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'  
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore  
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four  
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar  
The record sales soared and the world got toured  
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored  
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord  
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues  
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King  
It's Abdul Rakim, now watch me do my thing  
CHORUS  
Down, down, you go  
Down, down, so low  
Down, down, till you hit the floor  
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more  
You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'  
The Psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin'  
The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'  
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'  
'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP  
(???), it's Abdul Rakim  
And when referring to me you must respect the name  
Make a quick double take and double check your game  
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list  
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice  
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix  
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks  
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real  
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal  
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows  
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's  
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino  
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz  
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole  
I take it back to the future from the days of old  
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya  
Don't stick your nose in businessthat don't concern ya  
Might have to trip and flip like I've Turner

Three for the Khutba from the Imam  
Four for the mother that birthed my frame  
Five for the father 'cause he taught me game  
Been 'round the world, songs are all the same  
Sometimes when I'm asleep I still call your name  
Back when I was young I used to dream of fame  
Now they all point they fingers saying who's to blame  
Mothers put their girls into pigtail curls  
Fathers teach their sons how to shoot their guns  
They say, ""Boy don't never cry control your emotions  
Just take it like a man, make your stand""  
They say, ""Sex and violence go hand in hand""  
For every man blessed there got to be ten damned  
Expand through the depths of space and time  
Standing three eyes blind on the firing line

Twelve rakahs short on my full day's prayer  
Just hoping that the lord got some mercy to spare

Three for the angels, four for the alamin

And perfectly clean, got a Babylon feeling'  
Wounds that need healing', truth need revealing'  
Hands need washing' from all the dirty dealing'  
From the floor to the ceiling', from the stage to the door  
From the kings and the queens and the slaves and the whores  
For every lost cause where the martyrs are found  
That funky little sound, that make you want to get down  
Somebody told me once, love makes the world go round  
Now kids they carry pistols out on the playground  
That profound, gone too far.  
Praying to the light from a burned out star  
Put your lights on, put down your crosses  
It's time to tally up your wins and your losses

Two for Pac and B.I.G.

The poor they get poorer  
While liberty stands naked screaming in horror  
The emperor raped her but we just ignore her  
The rich they get richer  
The poor they get poorer  
  
Euthanize, youth will rise  
Scrutinize, truth from lies  
Time to revolutionize  
Organize, weaponize  
Easy come, easy go  
Think I'm movin' just a little bit too slow  
Got front row tickets to the big freak show  
Wait for the whole freakin' thing to blow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Homicide, genocide  
Victimize, paralyze  
Empathize and analyze  
Compromise and vandalize  
Easy come, hard to take  
Wide awake the original fake  
Find the heart, drive the stake  
Wait for the whole freakin' thing to break

Somewhere betweens the questions and clues you can solve the riddle  
Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay  
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away  
And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason  
And summertime you still smell like my favorite season  
And it feels like pain, it's just like pain  
Love is like pain, some people like pain  
Somewhere between the mountain and sea, a river is flowing  
Somewhere between the Earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing  
Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing  
Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing  
Somewhere along the road you might want to hitch a ride  
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride

Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing

Fill my eyes up with sand, pain  
Papercuts on my tongue, pain

Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered

Someday soon I know my former becomes latter

Live from Los Angeles, it's Saturday night  
While others staty tight we're looking for some parties to crash  
I never bounce, rock and splash without my Alkaholik stash  
I scooped the homie Tash, introduce me to Everlast  
He know where the bitches move fast so we can have a blast

I make room for every crew whose beats be booming  
I know you puffing some weed but are you down with some shrooming  
(Shrooming, hell nah, that's what the white boys be doing)  
I got room in the jeep, we can mash a few down  
Eat a few bags of shit and we could mash up a town  
See I know this spot where them things will be hot  
We guarantee at least two chickens up in every pot  
So whatcha want (whatcha got), ay yo, eat some of these  
And thrust us all up, you'll be cool like a breeze

Brought me back some orange juice, two vitamin C's  
And the look on my face look like a painful disease  
They tasted awful but by that time I had a jawful

Downhill, how does it feel, how long does it take to work  
Am I gonna fry my disk, does it make my stomach hurt  
Captain Kirk pulled into the night club parking lot  
The line was aroudn the block, hurry up and find a spot  
Straight to the bar drinking hennessey and orange juice  
I gotta be trippin', that bitch just melted through the floor

Don't take this shot wrong, but X you look like a demon (what)  
And I might start scremaing, I think I might puke (yeah)  
Cause I just heard a voice saying use the voice Luke, what the fuck

Feeling hypnotized, Peoples Dilated changing sides  
To my surprise we didn't even have to scrap tonight  
Higher than kites, staring at lights, this a other type of high

They're ready to bounce, yo I think we smoked the whole ounce  
I'm roaming the house, finding my words hard to pronounce  
Talking to myself, see Mariah Gage on the shelf  
For everything stays deep, I shoulda known all the cases  
Twenty-five lightnings is what Xzibit is facin'  
If somebody catch a slug at my house  
That's the last time I ever put some stupid ass drugs in my mouth  
Pulled a fifty, unloaded the gage, at least I thought so  
Except I kept one in the chamber for Vinnie?  
That's what I forgot, that's what I lost

Tell me when it went bad  
How to get back to the times that we had  
  
We're both young  
And our spirits are old  
Now we're just angry and we act like we're old  
We can't even talk it out without one of us walking away  
  
You were eighteen I just turned twenty nine  
I was fresh out the coffin and  
Girl you were so fine  
The future was bright  
The world, it seemed new  
I was with some other woman  
I was thinking of you  
Knew how it hurts  
Knew how it feels  
Knew it how aches  
Cos the heart never heals  
We're so busy screaming that we don't hear the words that we say  
Taking out lumps  
Took a few blows  
Hit a few bumps  
Had our fair share of wounds  
We tried to see good  
Through all of the bad  
Put on our smiles  
Pretend we're not sad  
Gotta be tough  
Gotta be strong  
Gotta be right  
Can't afford to be wrong  
It's hard to sing the blues  
When you're hearing bad news everyday  
  
We worry too much for one couple to bear  
Hunger so much for one person to care  
Fooling our family  
We're fooling our friends  
Pray that the pain and the frustration ends  
Hope is a chance  
Hope is a dream  
Hope is a drug  
Maybe hope's a vaccine  
  
In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray  
Shout at the devil  
I curse the lord  
Offer them everything I can afford  
I'd sell out my soul  
I lighten to see  
Tried to be righteous  
Tried to believe  
Prayed every prayer  
Kicked all of my highs  
For hours I'd stare at those beautiful eyes  
All of my problems seem to be melting away  
The smile on her face says daddy everything is okay  
  
In the race against time I get down on my knees and I pray

Cause prep-school Johnny  
Got some thug in his swagger  
Take seven politicians  
Put them in a line  
Take seven Hollow Points  
Put them in my Nine  
I'll give them seven more minutes  
For some prayin' time  
Then I'll pull back my trigger  
And I'll blow your mind...

Trying to hit the hard way so I can break like Steve Millar  
Take the money then I run son, I'm a lover and a killer

I'm a cooch blazing, bush chasing product of the city  
And I ain't asking for your love and I don't want your pity  
So girl don't talk about me shitty, don't act all high and ditty  
Cause if your man keep playing me funny I'm a come take all his money  
And leave him holy from this blessing with my four pound Smith-N-Wesson

Trying to shake these bones, I'm trying to get these shoes  
But yo they all think Whitey's cheating 'cause tonight I can't lose  
They want to take my funds but I'm a blaze my guns  
With burning sensations and heart palpitations  
Why you breathing so heavy, while your palms all sweaty  
And if you thinkin' bout a stick move, word to God you ain't ready  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby

You're gonna make it

Penny in your pocket  
Walking like a prophet  
Fortune teller  
Claiming your fame

On the  
Red carpet mile  
To the left  
To the right  
Step aside  
As you wave  
To the crowd  
A voice  
Cries out loud  
Look at you  
You're the new  
Overnight sensation

A paparazzi

At least you made it  
On the front page  
  
A tabloid be told  
All that glitters  
Ain't gold  
Not a muse  
Drug abuse suicide  
As you're left  
All alone  
After  
Selling your soul  
In the aisle, smile  
Ready  
For your close up

Got  
Your piece of the pie  
In the sky  
Don't look down  
As you hang on

Stars in your eyes  
Got  
Your piece of the pie  
In the sky  
Don't look down

Hanging on  
For your life  
For you're better off  
Dead then alive

Forever

I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money  
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny  
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey  
These pimps just better have a gothic for me  
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me  
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me  
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me

I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze  
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heeyyy  
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang  
A nigga might grin but it ain't still funny  
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money, heeyy

Jesus Schwarzenegger call me commando  
On that Remy Martin, nigga matta fact  
I ain't Fat Joe but I can make em lean back  
Save your ammo don't waste it  
Got him dodgin bullets like he in the matrix  
Jeans strapped and ya better dip  
Carvin 15, got six clips  
Pilsbury nigga, got a lotta dough  
Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes  
They place orders, so I bake cakes  
I'm a bodybuilder, pump a lotta weight  
You see the diamonds in my damn chain  
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang

You waitin instead of participatin with them boys  
You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys  
I'm hatin that they communicatin with them boys  
I'm waitin just to send them to Satan for that shit  
They see a nigga stones look sick  
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick  
'Cause I'm so hood rich  
That I'm no good bitch  
And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch  
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter  
sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter  
My style fit wit her  
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta

I love you like a lie  
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high  
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye  
Kept it a hundred with you... what give you the right to lie?  
We in two different spaces, and you done turned gemini  
Completely changed faces  
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places  
You'll never find another me, face it!

Got me like damn, where my homies at?  
Fuck it, it's just me

Love what you got, remember what you had  
Always forgive but never forget  
Learn from mistakes, but never regret  
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet  
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet  
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met  
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset  
I got the least out of something I put the most into  
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to  
You remind me of somebody that I used to know  
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before  
And I don't like that bitch

The nights she was goin through it  
Crying on my shoulder

I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her  
But I'm a rider

I guess the general just lost his best soldier  
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her  
She mean to me more

We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there  
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware  
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there

You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated  
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady  
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded

Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will

That you help me get good grades in all of my classes  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes

These bitches they done got real bad  
Cause now I pull out, Leaving 'em looking like model for a got milk ad  
I'm a teachers pet  
And even if you good at math ma  
You'll have trouble counting each baguette  
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha  
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters  
They don't care where the cops is  
Outta the blue they stop biz  
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz  
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs  
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb  
I might pass on a female, And call up a substitute just for night  
Class in the CL  
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared  
Can't tell her from giving my dick CPR  
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting, before squrting  
It's for certain  
You are the weakest link, Goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know my girls in North and South Caddy  
They all for mouth waxing  
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes  
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali  
And the Philly mommy's suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie  
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL  
Don't even know them hoes  
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece  
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous  
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle  
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA  
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole revolt  
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town  
My bitches in be-More, Blow til they knees sore  
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed down in St. Lou  
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions  
They just suck outta you like liposuction

And the G4 is just getting over the clouds  
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now  
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down  
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now  
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow  
I'm stuck in my city ways  
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze  
You rats can keep running through your city's maze  
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide  
I know you in that hole, you best to hide  
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified  
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed  
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs  
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs  
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill

From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be  
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be  
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be  
From the east to west, through the Mid West and down south it's Ghetto!  
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!  
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!

And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro  
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though  
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo  
You know it's him and the gang  
With the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue  
But remember the things, ain't too far  
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang  
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely  
I know the snakes gonna slither soon  
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon  
The back feels like sitting in the living room  
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman  
It's that man that back to back plat' scan  
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living  
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky  
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees  
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's  
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi  
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed  
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis  
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince  
And throw rose petals when I walk  
They love how I came back hard like good blow  
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho  
That's what hood though, yes I would know  
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers  
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother  
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others  
The man no other, cause I been in it  
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes  
I'm gone! catch up!

Niggas can't tell me nothin' dun, the 5 is kitted  
For Dead Presidents any cat alive can get it

Got enough chips to bribe you wit' it  
Pay off security at clubs, get my guns and knives admitted  
I'm the type that gets tried and acquitted  
If my vibes ain't wit' it I pull the four five and spit it  
  
Then niggas run to the precinct and describe who did it  
Come home and find the necks on their wives are slitted  
I got niggas on my side committed  
To leave you and the driver splitted  
With your brain inside your fitted

Puffin' sticky green 'till my eyes be slim

Swarm in a blue range, armed with two flames  
Flex play my joints, drop bombs like Hussein  
Catch a cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain  
  
I got coke in every part of Brooknam that you name  
Niggas want it, when you wave firearms their views change  
End up havin' to move they moms to Ukraine  
Get ADT alarms and new names  
  
What's come in the club, under each arm is two dames  
Buyin' bottles of Dom with his loose change  
Niggas hate me now 'cause I catch the eyes of dimes  
Flooded the hood with Tre's the size of dimes  
  
Ride through windows low, rims pokin' off the wheels  
I'm in the game tryin' to get broken off with Mils  
Shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin' off the steel  
Niggas love the band, but the bitches open off the grill

Hit ya chest up, leave you hooked to respirators  
Bed ridden talkin' to investigators

Dressed in Gators, in peace I'm restin' haters  
When police come for me, fly West to Vegas  
  
Ridin' or dyin', niggas know I'm ridin' with iron

Hate me now

It won't stop 'till my account is in the billions  
And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions  
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings  
Sippin' champagne I have trouble pronouncing while I'm chillin'  
Felt that you was squealin'  
You 'gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New
Zealand  
Cause I hire bountys that be killin'  
That play Hide-And-Go Seek and find you after countin' to a million  
But a million records later  
Theres still some speculators  
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters  
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators  
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader  
Spill the Tec on haters  
I got a quick jab  
But when I squeeze these slugs'll hit you a milla second later  
I chill and check the waiter  
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later  
You still a Lexus trader  
My credit so good I drive off in the sc and tell the dealer ""Catch ya later""  
All I need is one night I don't deal with second daters  
Cause the white and gold stones on the grill and neck persuade her nigga

Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard  
Ya like beef but hate when I'm involved  
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve  
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large  
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed  
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad  
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved  
So I play against the odds  
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad  
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred  
Rape you in the yard  
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage

I feel ashamed to spend, cause when it comes to knocking 'em down  
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin

Ma you must of had too many weed totes  
Cause I ain't giving you any see-notes  
I'm all about floating on them new skinny speed boats  
Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats  
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat  
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes  
No more shopping sprees I'm rough wit the ends  
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins  
I deal wit nothing but tens  
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends  
Chickens get keys, scuffing the Benz  
Cause they want to lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens  
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view  
(One try) I ain't trying to put clinks on you  
Hope tricking ain't one of the things you think John do  
Cause that's the way you end up wit a drink on you mami

The top on the 5 series be down  
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now  
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls  
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now  
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now  
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now  
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now  
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds  
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now  
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round  
Everybody staring unnecessarily now

Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone  
Tommy gun duck fitted to my mouth is chrome  
Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home  
Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown  
Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel  
Read the paper in my bed robe like Tony Soprano  
Throw em' all in the bottomless pit  
For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit  
[Cadillac Tah]  
Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay  
I leave you shrumped in this five coupe [Errr]  
Faggot nigga I slide through  
Any hood representin' my set, generation is new  
But I wear this tech like a vest  
Spit and tear up ya vest  
D-A double D for that dough  
Hit em' where it hurt most  
You niggas ain't comin' close  
I run up, gun up, hit you and ya done up, playa you ghost  
We killers, Violator, Murderer niggas  
[Hook]  
[R.C.]  
It's the violator, clip changer, mix the mayor  
Got trick eight to throw more kisses than Jada  
And a bitch serve the guard properly  
She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer  
It's R. Cadillac's on twenty-twos  
And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'  
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe  
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave  
[Fabolous]  
I come out with fire  
Stop, drop, roll out the booth  
Th rims come out the tires  
I stop, hop fall off the roof  
Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'  
This playa comin' back with the 4-5, like M. Jordan  
It's spelled with a capital F  
See everything from the sweater to the scarf to the capital F  
Now with the hoodrats, I'm like the rappin' Hugh hef  
Better known as F-A-be -O-L-O-you-S  
[Hook]  
[Fortune]  
It's time to separate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot  
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot  
Four chain glock on em' with no warning  
Leave ya hood like a circle with no corners  
Made dough with the pot, heatin' and raisin'  
Been around more pies than sweet potatoes  
Violators, big dogs respect the line  
Niggas act, I'ma tear em' up in the club like Shyne  
[Remy Martin]  
why'all know if I spill sixteen it's a massive commodity  
[Machine Gun Firing]  
So I'ma just lay eight and etch the bodies  
Everybody knows who's the hottest bitch  
And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit  
And any ho that chu' know love Rem and Nick  
Cause I spit as if I had a dick  
This rap shit I done mastered it, 8-ball assassin chick  
want to give it to me but they know I'm not havin' it

In them little cars with those big wheels  
With a little box full of those big steels  
Pretty little chicks in those big heels

They stare at the Airs and be sayin' it glowin'  
And they like my style and the way I be flowin'  
But that's when I bud in and say that I'm blowin'  
Now you could make the choice if you stayin' or goin'

We could go any place in the world  
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls  
Nobody in the street gonna hear

But can't keep it up like a Baget thong  
Keep frontin' like you spend  
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michael's skin  
On the other hand  
I'm the kind of brother man  
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand  
Bentley bright and rocky covered band  
And a zone that'll tell the time in another land  
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged 'em  
Its the Mustard Gut, Mayo Magnum  
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine  
That's why every body and they mother like mine

Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain  
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain  
  
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained  
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train  
Sometimes I ain't see no gain  
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains  
  
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim  
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games  
But now shit with these skios changed  
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange  
  
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain  
Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain  
Ya'll surprised F-A-be -O's sane  
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes  
I'm still here

""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""  
Who knew I'd have what it takes,  
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no  
My papa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared?  
'Cause one day it could happen""  
I dreamed about this game,  
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no  
  
I just want some peace of mind  
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine  
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline  
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined  
  
But on a small island, too far for police to find  
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined  
I gotta make sure my niece is fine  
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time  
  
Some be like ""At least you signed""  
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines  
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime  
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime  
  
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind  
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine  
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind  
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

Sometimes I wish I could go way back when  
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson  
Everything was OK back then  
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin

These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons  
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin  
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s  
  
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin

But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions  
  
If I would've let this flow stay packed in

I done felt pain, waited but no help came  
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane  
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain  
Ever been told ""go to hell"" and felt flames  
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper  
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper  
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper  
  
It cost to be the boss, it aint get no cheaper  
But there's a man above that we all under bro  
No bread truck but he work wonders though!  
After you wake up, everything is wonderful  
You can overcome anything you undergo  
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture  
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you  
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses  
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches  
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses  
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches  
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?  
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious  
So I sold weed and crack, business  
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious  
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses  
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness  
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business  
Beef is only good when you in the burger business  
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal

But for real you loaded up to kill  
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will

Straight out of Brooklyn a baby mama snatcher named Ghetto  
Invisible set glow  
Full clip to let go  
Back in the metro  
Fresh off the jet though  
Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show  
Gangsta but i'm the flyest you ever met ho  
Button up etro  
The Air Jordan Retro  
Million dollar neck row  
Got homie upset so  
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo'  
Told you from the get go  
Ya'll can't deny it  
I just supply it  
For those who buy it  
Now I ride by it  
It might start a riot  
Chicks won't quiet  
Long enough to try it  
Dirt they throwin' mud slides on my name  
They never seen this kind of stud size in a chain  
I analyze that like i'm Billy Crystal  
I'm forced to move around with this nine milly pistol

What these niggas say man  
They even talked about Jesus  
I ain't mad at when it rain, 'cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin'  
Sorta like some clear diamonds  
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin'  
Some where rhymin', or somewhere climbin'  
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky  
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly  
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me  
I know these grease balls, wonder how could they ever stick me  
But I move, like the President through town  
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown  
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, 'cause the cometary  
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found  
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throws  
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole  
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic  
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record  
And the girls more than like you, when you running around  
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you  
You going on like thirty-six, flowin' on some berry mix  
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks  
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick  
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six  
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up  
'Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up  
I just turn the system up and keep boppin'  
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin'  
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection  
Don't they see when I come through  
How these people point in my direction  
That's why I poke out my jeans  
Like my joint with a erection  
Till I'm in a joint made for correction  
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread  
It wouldn't even surprise me  
If one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga  
Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it  
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flippin' and pitchin'  
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it  
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent  
I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that  
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap  
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap  
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back  
I get you murdered if I think you a rat  
'Cause if you don't show loyalty  
Then that show me where ya principles at  
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact  
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats  
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it  
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated  
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it  
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it  
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it  
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement  
And I blow off ya head for no reason and just when I'm leavin'  
You don't know me ya owe me homie  
But the spread make us even, blow

And I'm just havin' fun

I'm sitting in the crib dreaming about killing ya  
With machine guns shotties and desert E dilligers  
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy  
And watching him die slow  
You need full clips to push up in the joint  
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint  
'cause theses motherfuckers will push him to the point  
That you'll end up locked down doing push ups in the joint  
But they'll box you in the corner  
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner  
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya  
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you want to  
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle  
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle  
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)  
Till there's a murial on your block and some candles

I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' clown  
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect  
  
My Teflons will have you screaming like Wyclef Jean (someone please call
9-1-1)  
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm  
I'ma have more bury than that guy Stephon  
First they put that white seed over you brother  
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover  
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other  
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother  
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in  
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greaving  
When you pull the marijuana  
I'ma want to kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor  
But I'm loosing my patience  
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation  
Now it's easy for me to understand  
How you could just kill a man

Than carried by the six  
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks  
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six  
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga  
Picture me putting my hearse  
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks  
I might as well put in the work  
Spit em up outta here and get em up outta here  
I got the juice like bishop had wit him  
That just don't give a fuck, semi  
Like ol' dog had wit him  
I'm saying prayers for my enemy  
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me  
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me  
But I know I don't want them slugs going into me  
I'm just trying to live my life  
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life

Look what you made me do man  
Look what you made me do man  
I didn't want it to come to the right  
But fuck it,  
Niggas will push you to that point man  
Niggas will play with you so much man  
Aggravate you so much man  
That you want to kill a nigga man

You're all a bunch of fucking assholes  
You know why?  
'Cause you don't got the guts to be what you want to be  
Fabolous...he doesn't have that problem  
  
He always tells the truth  
That's what it's all about?  
That's what we work so hard for Fabolous?  
So they can point their fucking fingers  
and call me the fucking bad guy?  
  
[Verse 1]  
I guess I'm the bad guy  
The fingers is pointing  
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in  
They be asking fellas why (why?)  
  
It's cause the streets is watching  
With an envious ear, jealous eye  
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin  
I keep the home ??? two way contact for Johnny Cochran  
  
Be the same dudes, testing your patience  
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents  
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance  
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments  
  
These playas been playin' foul  
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants  
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment  
I'm what they been trying to do, not do  
  
I'm the kid, they been lying to you  
You need people like me  
I'm so F-A, be -O, L-O, you-S  
Yeah, that's the bad guy  
  
[Pain In Da Ass]  
You need people like me  
So you can point your fucking fingers  
And say, ""That's the bad guy.""  
So, what they make you?  
Good?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is yours  
Quit they job and live off the child support  
How could you stand there, smile in court  
I'm a just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts  
  
You better sign a pre-nup  
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'  
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'  
I love the way your butt swishes  
  
But non of these slut bitches  
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches  
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell  
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail  
  
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it  
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet  
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa  
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters  
  
Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend  
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real  
  
[Pain In Da Ass]  
So say goodnight to the bad guy, come on  
It's the last time you're gonna hear a bad guy ???  
You better make way, it's a bad guy coming through  
  
[Verse 3]  
Come on  
What type of bad guy give fellas ???, females hugs  
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs  
I get threats over the two way from email thugs  
  
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs  
Think I'm liking you? Wrong  
'Cause even if I get locked  
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong  
  
Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song  
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on  
When you holla in the club it's cool  
But don't change the subject fool  
  
And start askin if I remember you from public school  
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing  
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin  
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me  
  
[unknown] guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me  
I don't care what other haters do  
But if you think I'm loved for saving you  
Say goodnight to the bad guy  
  
[Pain In Da Ass]  
Whoever said to us  
Now maybe you can buy yourself  
one of them first class tickets to the Resurrection  
(Gun Shot)

Who wanna bet us that they can't fuck wit us?  
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, solely etceteras  
Til the death of us, me and my confidents  
We shine, we make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme  
  
You lil niggas need guidance, you barkin up the wrong trees  
Pissin on the wrong hydrants, I'm a high fence  
I grew up round violence, you grew up playin violins  
In yo hood silence, where I'm from silence  
  
[Verse:]  
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe  
There's something bout killing shit that makes us feel alive  
We feed off yo energy, we see you on that Kenny G  
Just do in yo own harm, do yo thing my nig  
Whenever you will not keep to that mighty nyc  
We gon check that name you claim  
Bring yo job and id  
We take it the wrong way, all gold everything  
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those, everything  
Yall don't wanna pump heads, ocho, Evelyn  
Them boys will leave you butt naked  
And the mall closed and everything  
The streets is watchin aksin if you gon reply to them  
Seem like yall woke up sleeping giants, Eli and Em  
  
[Hook:]  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm like Nino with the uzzi back of the motorcycle head  
Until you're back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding  
I'm like dope boy lookin for Ricky's killer  
One last soldier, niggas who turn they backs on me  
Turn yo punk ass over  
Yall smoke my smoked my cousin Harold  
Now I'm in a Camaro  
Love and happiness playing, me and my dog with a double barrel  
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker  
I'm Pac, ride or miss, riverside motherfucker  
Get back, everybody better get back  
To my niggas in the jet black  
For the seats let back on yo jet back  
If you're a gambling man you could bet that  
It's a sure thing, not just a New York thing  
A rich or a poor thing  
It's a lace yo boots, pull yo draw string, who wanna go to war thing?  
It's a who gon protect your thing?  
Who really wanted morphine?  
Put legends in coffins  
It's a bullet holes in the door thing  
It's a nobody, sure things  
Street cold, not a Lord thing  
It's kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor thing  
Poor thing, to get back is important  
Poor thing, for the dead homies we pour pain  
Like what you sayin while it's cocked back to em  
Guess what goes around comes around, got back to em

A major comeback but from a minor setback

Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
F-A-be  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me  
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now  
Dip-low immunity  
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me  
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly  
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V  
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe  
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me  
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?  
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry  
So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""  
Say ""sure"" and be me  
  
[Chorus 1: Fabolous]  
But this is my party  
Stroll by if you want to  
Or y'all can stay home  
But why would you want to?  
  
[Fabolous]  
We gon' party, till we laid in graves  
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves  
Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
That groupie made her wait  
Cause when she seen the whips and chains  
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon  
  
[Chorus 2: x2]  
This is my party  
So get fly if you want to  
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to  
Put your hands up as high as you want to  
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""  
  
[Fabolous]  
I don't know about y'all  
But we doin' it over here  
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here  
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here  
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here  
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear  
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this  
You see why we asks is to see ID  
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access  
Me I relax this (easy)  
Cause I'm used to ballin'  
You could tell that these guys need practice  
But if it was a problem then I would confront you  
You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""  
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put  
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look  
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook  
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale  
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell  
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell  
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well  
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail  
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail  
The Street Family speed off six SL's  
To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""  
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well  
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell  
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view  
Girl I know that these guys say they want you  
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday  
Same hoes from yesterday  
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday  
Her hang-overs yesterday  
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today  
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday

Ya know, catch me if you can nigga

It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
I rock the reds pete rose when I'm in the 'natti  
And [repeat: x4]  
You cant see the semi-automatti  
When I'm in the chi' you think they ain't that shocked  
To see the kid roll through in the st. pats socks  
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on soul train  
The bulls, when mike had hair and a gold chain  
I get the spirit in St. Louis, how could the god lose  
I do back flips in the ozzie cardinals  
They love me in Cleveland, every time I travel there  
I'm in the Indians or that cavaliers  
When I hit Minnesota, that kid from brooklyn wear  
The vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year  
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back  
20 years with the bucks and brewers throw backs  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
  
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder  
Rock the trailblazer warm-up, cause Portland gets colder  
And even the pimps be jealous  
When I'm in the floor seat at the forum in the m.p.l.s.  
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest  
This the rams before they moved to the midwest  
When I'm in the bay with it, I don't play with it  
I'm in the athletics with the matchin' A's fitted  
This ain't even for the minors  
Cause they don't know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers  
Seattle, probably heard different rumors  
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.  
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway  
Or the nuggets that make them yell  
In phoenix I do the old suns  
Cause the new jerseys is cool, but nothings really like the old ones  
Ya know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In new york what I wear the the club may vary  
Mets or Yankees like the subway series  
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean  
In a hot red Soxs or Celtics green  
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these  
In a size 56 Phillies  
In jersey I got the nets on  
That you can bet on  
In d.c. I couldn't pull it  
Without the bullets  
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long  
Them birds know I got the falcons or the hawks on  
That peach Tampa bay don't hit the streets too often  
Not even Miami could take the heat of dolphins  
Ain't no complaints on  
When I'm in New Orleans with the saints on  
In Houston I pass hoes  
In the Astros  
In Dallas I always gotta have  
The cowboys or the mavs  
? to keep it coming, and I'ma keep it coming

Just want to spend eternity

All I needed was to get my own way  
Get out of my way  
  
Miss Judy she could have me  
Any hour of the working day  
She'd send me in the corn field mid afternoon  
Said son it's all part of your job  
  
Miss Judy had a cross eyed poodle  
That I would kick if I was given the chance  
Never was amused by the kindness I used  
I was whipped in the barn until dawn  
It hurt me  
  
Last summer we was restless  
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm  
But it was all in the head  
'Cause out in the yard  
Miss Judy had the National Guard  
We was beaten, before we started  
  
Miss Judy she was moody  
And she always didn't get her own way  
  
Just state the facts, get it right  
Kick her when she's down

Faces,Stone,/f/faces/stone_20052416.html,"(ronnie lane)  
Once I was a stone many years ago  
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.  
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.  
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,  
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan  
Dan the blacksmith.  
Once I was a sword, many years ago.  
And my blade was broad, many years ago.  
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.  
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,  
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,  
Oh my.  
Once I was a daisy, many years ago.  
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.  
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float  
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,  
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.  
Once I was a grub, many years ago.  
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.  
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.  
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.  
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.  
Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.  
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.  
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,  
Said ""pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke"".  
Once I was a mule, a many years ago.  
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.  
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick  
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,  
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.  
I was born a human baby, many years ago.  
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.  
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be
wild.  
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.  
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.  
I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.  
I've known good times and disaster.  
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,  
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.  
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.

Who have a way of gettin on with their lives  
I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot older every day  
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy  
I got to get away  
  
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough

I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Our boys are strong the spittin image of you when you were young  
I hope someday they can see past what you have become  
And I remember every time I said I'd never leave  
But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be  
  
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough  
You ain't the only one who feels like this world left you far behind  
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your door  
I never quite made it back to the one I was before  
And God it hurts me to think of you  
For the light in your eyes was gone  
Sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone  
  
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love

Come on, Come on, into my arms  
Come on, Come on  
Give in to me  
  
I'll use my eyes to draw you in  
Until I'm under your skin  
I'll use my lips  
I""ll use my arms  
Come on, Come on

Got no reason to turn around  
Ain't got no looking back or second guessing  
It's time to find what love is really all about

All the way to forever tonight

Go the distance this time

We may find ourselves on shaky ground  
And there ain't no place  
That these two hearts can't travel  
Even when we're miles apart  
Together we are bound to  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong

There will be rainy days and bridges left to cross  
But if we lose our way we can't get lost if we  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight

I'm losing all control in bein' free  
And I always wanna stay  
  
I never thought that I'd let go long enough  
To fall for someone deeply  
Who had the power to erase my fears  
And find me so completely  
  
I get lost inside your stare  
Lost when you're not there  
And everything I have  
Doesn't mean a thing if it's without you  
If it's a dream

Don't tell me where we're goin'  
I don't wanna know  
I like the mystery  
I can't believe we've come this far  
So far away from where we started off  
You found me when I wasn't lookin'  
You found me  
  
And now I'm lost inside your stare  
Lost when you're not there  
And everything I have  
Doesn't mean a thing if it's without you  
Without you..

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah  
  
You think that I don't feel love  
But what I feel for you is real love  
In other's eyes I see reflected  
A hurt, scorned and rejected  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, born in poverty  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, take a look at me  
  
I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum  
My father left  
He never even married mom  
I shared the guilt my mama knew  
So afraid that others knew I had no name  
  
This love we're contemplating  
Is worth the pain of waiting  
We'll only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, scorned by society  
Love child, always second best  
Love child, different from the rest  
  
Hold on  
Hold on (Ooooooohhh)  
  
I started school, in a worn, torn,  
Dress that somebody threw out  
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt  
To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Don't think that I don't need you  
Don't think I don't wanna please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing  
The name of shame I've been wearing  
  
Love child, never quite as good  
Afraid  
Ashamed  
Misunderstood  
  
But I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you

Had me a sweet one, I tell no lie  
Summer nights in the cornfields  
When the corn gets so high  
We traveled clear across Wichita, headin' north  
Leavin' civilization  
  
And there were highways to get across  
And places far from here  
And I was his lonesome prairie  
And he was my wild frontier  
  
Harvested peaches in a small border town  
Saved all our wages  
Put ten percent down  
I never thought I'd see the world through a child's eyes  
Until early December  
  
Then one Calgary morning  
Still as glass  
While my baby lay sleeping, an angel slipped past  
And with one breath said I'm taking him back  
To his Father in Heaven  
  
Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow  
I held him through my tears  
Because I was his lonesome prairie

Somewhere with it

Will you get tired of what you got

All the same greats, the same mistakes  
It doesn't have to be like this.  
If you don't make a friend, now  
One might make you-

The gentle art of making enemies  
Don't look so surprised  
Happy birthday...Fucker

All you need is just one more excuse  
You put up one hell of a fight  
I want to hear your very best excuse  
Never felt this much alive  
Your day has finally come  
So wear the hat and do the dance  
And let the suit keep wearing you.  
This year you'll sit and take it  
And you will like it  
It's the gentle art of making enemies  
I deserve a reward  
'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had  
And if I tighten up my hole  
You may never see the light again

Faith No More,The Morning After,/f/faith+no+more/the+morning+after_20052647.html,"Awakened by the sunlight  
Victimized by the light  
Memories flashin' through my head  
WasI born or am I dead?  
Yesterday's forgotten, the morning after  
I can taste you, I can hear your laughter  
Fading in the distance  
Recollections drifting  
Bloodstains on my tattered clothes  
Each minute the fear grows  
If I could just lay down to rest  
I'm tired of searching for myself  
If I am dead, how can I feel such love?  
If I am dead, why am I dreaming?  
If I am dead, where do I go from here?  
If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?  
Is this blood dried upon my face?  
Or is it the love of someone else?  
It tastes so sweet, just like you used to  
So rescue me my love, splice us together  
I remember loving you so much  
But where are you and where's your fatal touch?  
When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?  
Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?  
I am thirsty for my sleep  
There are no answers anyway.

Because the girls would sing:  
Rock me Amadeus,

Fall Out Boy,"You're Crashing, But You're No Wave",/f/fall+out+boy/youre+crashing+but+youre+no+wave_20539762.html,"The D.A. is dressed to the nines  
In the mirror he practices all his lines  
To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor  
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper  
The headline reads: ""The man hangs, but the jury doesn't.""  
  
And everybody's looking for relief  
The United States versus disbelief  
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle  
From face to floor the body falls like bachelors or bad luck girls  
Only breathing with the aid of the knife  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can't lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
He glances at his pew seating seven to twelve stacked  
On one to six the gallery is hushed  
Boys in three pieces dream of girls' daring and bravado  
The city streets in a cell not withstanding what we don't know  
Hang on the rope of bated breath  
Whichever you prefer  
  
And everyone's looking for relief  
A bidding war for an old friend's grief  
The calls for chick, the calls for charm  
Another girl that's not aware but that can make you comprehend  
Too well dressed for the witness stand  
The best place for whichever headlines run  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
First class suit and tie  
I'm desperate  
Sing and die  
Can talk my way out of anything  
The foreman reads the verdict and the above-entitled actions  
We find the defendant (guilty)  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can left his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
Case open, case shut  
That you could be the cause of that casket  
Baby boy can left his head and he cares  
Isn't it tragic?

Fatboy Slim,Long Way From Home,/f/fatboy+slim/long+way+from+home_20633751.html,"To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
Switch the channel on my T-V,  
And the cameras are fixed on me again,  
I'm running and I'm running and I can't seem to hide,  
The skies so red that I'm loosing my mind  
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside  
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside  
  
The fours walls have come taking all that's mind  
There steeling my toys leave no memories behind  
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,  
They ? my thoughts not cars or trains  
The thoughts were bought but kept me sane  
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
Stare out my window, I'm yearning for more  
Bust for my borrowers and settle the score  
I want my toys but the man out there's to hard  
Running around, feet on the ground  
Can't seem to understand this game there playing  
And no one seem to wanna sit with me.  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night

Fatboy Slim,Moonbeam Woman,/f/fatboy+slim/moonbeam+woman_20671086.html,"Who's that sister, mader her own space,  
She's got moondust on her 'fro.  
Damn we miss her sugarsome face,  
Wistful, moonbeam sense to go.  
Six months later she steamed up the van,  
We got no small surprise.  
Daisy lady sits on her hand, a naughty sparkle in her eyes.  
  
Daisy Lady, come flyin' out my hand.  
Daisy Lady, Playmate of the land.  
  
Late arrival, never been kissed,  
Strode up sneaking in tongues.  
Settled nicely up to the wrist,  
Grinding to the bass and the drum.  
3 years later she's back in her stride,  
Down Full Circle doin' the bump,  
Lovely Lady, up on her feet,  
She's getting over the hump.  
  
That poor old poet didn't know so,  
But she cooked the wrong goose.  
She should have lapped it up  
And licked it like we do with that juice.  
And if you ask her she just shrugs  
And digs the life that she chose.  
She sure 'nuff gets some when her cup overflows.  
  
Can't stop Won't stop, rockin' to the lady 'cuz I get down and I go down x
many

Fatboy Slim,The Whip,/f/fatboy+slim/the+whip_20671072.html,"I know some people they ain't got no money  
But they do got a means to an end,  
Cuz they got juice and they got plenty of lovin'  
And a big heap of beautiful friends.  
I know some people didn't know that they're born,  
They don't know the soles of their feet.  
Well you can't fight a war when you got lovin' in store  
There on the sunny side of the street.  
Let's do the whip  
Everybody get hip to it  
  
Ain't nothin' missin' we got a pot to kiss in  
We got karma, we am what we am.  
It's up to you because the best that you can do  
Is the best that you can.  
My situation is the fellation nation,  
Dancing to the brotherly beat,  
Well you can't fight a war when you got lovin' in store  
There on the sunny side of the street

Fifth Harmony,Leave My Heart Out Of This,/f/fifth+harmony/leave+my+heart+out+of+this_21068292.html,"My heart is telling me that you were gonna change, but no  
My heart is lying right to my face, yeah  
  
My heart is making up excuses for your ways, but I wish that  
My heart knew when I should walk away  
  
It lets me down, it helps me as I get back up off the ground  
You're telling me that this is love but I found, it wasn't really on my side  
Now I think it's time  
  
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinion to itself  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my heart out of
this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
I'm done feeling like a stranger to myself, so I know  
I've got to put all my feelings on a shelf, yeah  
  
It lets me down, loves me as I get back up off the ground  
You're telling me that this is love but I found, it wasn't really on my side  
Now I think it's time  
  
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinion to itself  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my heart out of
this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
Sometimes I wish you'd just shut up and let me think  
I've had enough, I need to just make up my mind (Make up my mind)  
So that's why  
  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my  
Leave my heart out of this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
Le le le leave my heart  
Le le le leave my head  
No no oohhh
