Amy Grant,It's Too Late,/a/amy+grant/its+too+late_20329646.html,"Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time  
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying  
One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
It used to be so easy living here with you  
You where light and breezy and I knew just what to do  
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
There'll be good times again for me and you  
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too  
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you  
But it's too late, baby, it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it

Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing  
And jingle bells ring  
Snowin' and blowin'  
Up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in  
Jingle bell time  
Dancin' and prancin'  
In jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
  
What a bright time  
It's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell, time  
Is a swell time  
To go glidin' in a  
One horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up, jingle horse  
Pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle  
In a jinglin' beat  
That's the jingle bell rock

Amy Grant,Lay Down,/a/amy+grant/lay+down_20007698.html,"It's a cold, cold world  
That we're walking through.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
But it's warm as toast  
Walking two by two,  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
It's a fine, fine line  
Betwixt love and hate.  
Why, it's tough to tell the two apart.  
But you know it's love  
That He offers you.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,

Amy Grant,Lead Me On,/a/amy+grant/lead+me+on_20007683.html,"Shoulder to the wheel  
For someone else's selfish gain  
Here there is no choosing  
Working the clay  
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.  
  
Fire in the field  
Underneath a blazing sun  
But soon the sun was faded  
And freedom was a song  
I heard them singing when the day was done  
Singing to the holy One.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.  
  
Waiting for the train  
Labelled with a golden star  
Heavy hearted boarding  
Whispers in the dark  
""Where are we going--is it very far?""  
  
Bitter cold terrain  
Echoes of a slamming door  
In chambers made for sleeping, forever  
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar  
Cry to the Lord.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.  
  
Man hurts man  
Time and time, time again  
And we drown in the wake of our power  
Somebody tell me why.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on

Amy Grant,Leave It All Behind,/a/amy+grant/leave+it+all+behind_20007634.html,"I took a drive along the west bank of the shore  
I thought of what you said then I thought some more  
You say your life is all but chiseled out in stone  
And all you want is just a taste of the unknown  
  
Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone  
You say you need a change, I recognize the tone  
Buy me a ticket please, to anywhere I'll go  
I'm not saying what is right or what is wrong  
I'm just thinking you've been hanging here too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, why don't we, just up and leave it all behind  
Maybe a change would ease your mind  
For a time, leave it all behind  
  
What I really want to do is see you smile  
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while  
There's too much going on to keep it all inside  
You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out

I stumble down the hall and I open up the door  
Then I look into the mirror just like you know you do  
Stopping for a moment  
I can feel my mind go through the boundaries of time  
Back to a heart without his love inside  
I was more than just alone, I was dying on my own  
Thinking that nothing was ever gonna save my life  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be look what, look what  
When you stop and think it over do you think you're doing well  
Are you getting stronger, can you really tell?  
If you're truthful with your feelings then you'll see there's room to grow  
Though we may have found the answer  
There is so much more to know, more to this life  
'Cause we can never stop growin' or we'll start to die  
I cannot survive alone, I am nothin' on my own  
But seeing's believin' and if you need to see look at me  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far

Nobody else  
No one there to save us

And when the storms came through  
They found me and you  
Back to back together  
And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine  
Yours and mine forever

Oh how the years go by  
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes the sould never dies  
We fight, we laugh, we cry  
As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down  
But we came around  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now we're back on solid ground, yeah  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring  
In this world of dangers  
'Cause when your heart is strong  
You know you're not alone  
In this world of strangers

Any night or day  
Well we'll always be

Under branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore

Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
He came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
It's hard to explain how a few precious things  
Seem to follow throughout all our lives  
After all's said and done I was watching my son  
Sleeping there with my bear by his side  
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going  
I swear that the old bear whispered ""Boy welcome home""

I thought I'd climbed the highest wall  
Now I see the learning never ends  
And all I know to do is keep on walking  
Walking 'round the bend, saying  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why

I traveled each and ev'ry highway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few

I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all, when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fill, my share of losing  
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way,  
Oh no, oh no, not me, I did it my way  
  
For what is a man, what has he got?  
If not himself, then he has naught  
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels  
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!

Andy Williams,And Roses And Roses,/a/andy+williams/and+roses+and+roses_20520088.html,"Words and Music by Ray Gilbert and Dorival Caymmi  
  
Every day I sent another present  
Just to let her know how very much I care  
I wrote a little love note with each present  
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere  
  
My poor worried heart was almost certain  
That this love affair would never be  
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and  
From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank you for saying what I couldn't say  
Oh, what a wonderful way to tell her ""I love you"" each day  
With roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
(Roses and roses and roses and roses of love)  
  
Fade  
Roses and roses and roses and roses of love

Andy Williams,Happy Heart,/a/andy+williams/happy+heart_20217839.html,"There's a certain sound always follows me around  
When you're close to me you will hear it  
It's the sound that lovers hear when they discover  
There could be no other for their love  
  
[CHORUS:]  
  
It's my happy heart you hear  
Singing loud and singing clear  
And it's all because you're near me, my love  
Take my happy heart away  
Let me love you night and day  
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love  
  
Feeling more and more like I've never felt before  
You have changed my life so completely  
Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now  
I'm not half, I'm whole now with your love

Andy Williams,Heard The Bells On Christmas Day,/a/andy+williams/heard+the+bells+on+christmas+day_20218232.html,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
And in despair, I bowed my head  
There is no peace on Earth, I said  
For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
With peace on Earth, good will to men

With each season's change

On a velvet wind she comes to me each day

We've drunk the barrels dry.""

And the lanterns all burned low,  
I'd never thought we'd make it  
But we've twenty leagues to go  
So blow you southern trades  
And guide me safely to the shore,  
I'll never ever gonna sail  
The seven seas no more

The roll of the tide and the salt in the air

Comin' on home to you  
I don't want to miss the wind in my eyes,  
The shimmerin' light when the seagull flies  
Lo, I've traveled far  
I'm a home loving man,  
Home is where you are  
  
The crowd upon the quayside  
Their faces long and drawn  
Are suddenly awakened  
As we sail in on the dawn  
The wives, the sons, the lovers,  
Who never gave up hope  
All breathe a sigh together  
As they reach to catch the rope  
  
God bless you, southern trades,  
You got me safely back this time  
Oh, you'll never have the need again  
To save this soul of mine

Andy Williams,Mac Arthur Park,/a/andy+williams/mac+arthur+park_20007874.html,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl  
It ran one step ahead  
As we followed in the dance  
Between the parted pages and were pressed  
In love's hot fevered iron  
Like a striped pair of pants  
  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
It was foaming like a wave  
On the ground around your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing  
Checkers by the trees  
  
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet green icing flowing down  
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain  
And I don't think that I can take it  
Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh, no, oh no  
  
There will be another song for me  
For I will sing it  
There will be another dream for me  
Oh, someone will bring it  
  
I will drink the wine while it is warm  
And never let you catch me looking at the sun  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one  
Little girl  
  
I will take my life into my hands, I will use it  
I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it  
I will have the things that I desire  
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky  
  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life  
I'll be thinking of you  
And wondering why

Came to Bethlehem that night

In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark

Listen what they say

Legrand won an Oscar for his score.  
  
The summer smiles, the summer knows  
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes  
The summer smoothes the restless sky  
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie  
The summer knows, the summer's wise  
She sees the doubts within your eyes  
And so she takes her summer time  
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger  
Twists the world 'round her summer finger  
Lets you see the wonder of her arms  
And if you've learned your lessons well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall  
  
And if you've learned your lesson well

My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me  
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm.  
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night  
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light  
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea  
And I'm swept away from sadness, clinging to her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm  
Sweet memories, sweet memories

There's no one in the world  
Except the two of us  
  
Should tomorrow find us disenchanted  
We have shared the love that few have known  
Summers by the sea, a sailboat in Capri  
These memories shall be our very own  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety two  
Although it's been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas  
Merry Christmas to you

That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To fight the unbeatable foe, to reach the unreachable star

Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

met a group of likely girls  
Traded posters and the voxpops

Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, ""You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!"" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""  
  
The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy  
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo

That made her life unbearable  
While living in that hole  
Of her dark surburban nightmare  
'Till she went to see the Dead  
And the self esteem she valued  
Was immediately spent  
And she had no one to turn to  
So she just turned off her mind  
She's a well adjusted wanderer  
But all this stuff takes time

There's a couple from L.A.  
They are post-environmentalists  
Looking for to stay  
'Till their friends all come to join them  
In the quest for air to breathe  
And when it gets too crowded  
They will just pick up and leave  
Like they did in New York City  
When the coast seemed quite sublime  
It don't take much but money  
And money just takes time  
  
Marie is on the lounge chair  
Draped around the pool  
Avoiding almost anyone who'd  
Desecrate he cool  
It's the reason she's attractive  
She's already self abused  
And her pride won't feel the loneliness  
That comes with being used  
She's the center of the universe  
For which she was designed  
Until she wakes up wandering  
Why all this stuff takes time  
  
Bill died of a heart attack  
Beating up his wife  
Now he's come back as a lesbian  
That's looking for his wife  
Who is now a psychoanalyst  
That likes to work with plants  
Except of course on weekends  
When she likes to wear the pants  
She's a leather goddess minister  
Who works with the confined

Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away  
There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those  
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose  
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?  
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight  
You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared  
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired  
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play  
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away  
Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more  
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure  
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way  
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight

Arlo Guthrie,Chilling Of The Evening,/a/arlo+guthrie/chilling+of+the+evening_20165996.html,"Warm me from the wind and take my haand  
A song is sounding, softly singing  
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves  
Forever splashing in the sunlight  
Prove to me there's a love still left  
In all of this emptiness around me  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
Though you know my love that I must go  
A-following the winds that blow inside me  
I've nowhere left to run or hide  
Except if you will come and run beside me  
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do  
To keep believing  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
And now my time has come down many streets  
I'm coming from a night decaying  
The song that itself sings is all alone  
I cannot even hear it playing  
Now to leave before I understand  
Just what it is I'm leaving  
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Sunrise and sundown  
Moon rolls through the nighttime  
Till daybreak comes around  
All my life's a circle  
Still I wonder why  
Seasons spinning 'round again  
Years keep rolling by  
  
Seems like I've been here before  
Can't remember when  
I got this funny feeling  
We'll all be together again  
No straight lines make up my life  
All my roads have bends  
No clear cut beginnings  
So far no dead ends

I've met you a thousand times  
I guess you've done the same  
Then we lose each other

We died in your valleys and died on your plains  
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes

Arlo Guthrie,Doors Of Heaven,/a/arlo+guthrie/doors+of+heaven_20518613.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Where would all the angels go  
Would they just fly around forever  
Or would they come down here below  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light  
If all the doors were close in heaven  
They'd have to close the road to hell  
We'd all be stuck here with each other  
There would be nowhere else to dwell  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And everyone there had to leave  
And death was nothing but a moment  
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Who would dare abuse a child  
Or let a little kid go hungry  
Or not return a simple smile  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And the host of heaven was on the street  
I wonder if they'd look much different  
From the likes of you and me  
So I hope they close the doors to heaven  
And all the angels up above  
Come and build a home among us  
Remind us what it is to love  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light

Sitting down under the light of day now

I've been here for an hour or so  
And nothing much is going down  
I don't care much anyway  
Because you know I've been around  
  
Here on the edge of the green fields growing  
And the sunlight warming all around  
And the blowing of the early mist in the morning  
You know that I don't hear a sound  
  
Till once in a while, when a truck rolls by,  
Carrying a overload  
I don't wanna go nowhere right now  
I feel like my future sold  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it won't do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell I've been  
  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
And I'm walkin' all around the field  
Thinkin' to myself about the city life scenes  
And man you know they ain't for real  
  
All you got to do is stick your foot in your mouth  
And tell it where you want to go  
End up talkin' to yourself some time  
Alone along a country road  
  
Stand on the good land children

And do the same this morning  
Like I went and did yesterday

Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky

And it's sad that failure is an awful crime  
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two  
But now it seems that there's a different point of view  
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic  
Down to congress there's a safety net for you

Leaves turn gold and then they fall  
They've gone down, now they've grown  
They're going home  
  
Mountain streams may run and flow  
Clean the sands on which they go  
Stretching down like it had known  
It's going home  
  
Sunrise early in the dawn  
Slips away, then it's gone  
Leaves the night to carry on  
While it's going home  
  
Once a man he lived and died  
What he said death could not hide  
Even though it's often tried  
But he was going home  
  
Now my friends it's time to go  
And this love will live to grow  
And I want you all to know  
I'm going home

And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night  
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light  
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo

Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become  
The stuff of time amid the waves  
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done  
  
As the seabird flies aboce  
My songs are sung to those I've come to love  
The petals strung into the leis  
The flowering of days I've just begun  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
When gods and goddesses decreed  
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas  
The sound of sovereign thrones  
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans  
  
This crazy love amazes me  
As I just gaze into your eyes  
The liquid sun is split upon the sea  
I want to be where I can see the moon arise  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Before the moment fades to summarize  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
Along the lonely stretch of sand  
Reduced to just a woman and a man  
Bathed in the lunar light  
The likes of which I might just understand  
  
Among the myths I know are real  
The goddess disguised as herself revealed  
I sang her song out loud  
She sat herself beside me in the crowd  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Into the moment that she would allow  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

Arlo Guthrie,Which Side,/a/arlo+guthrie/which+side_20337930.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's trouble all around the world  
Well, it looks that way to me  
People don't know what to do  
They don't know where they should be  
But just one question still remains  
To which we must respond  
Two roads lead from where we are  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS:  
Are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Which side are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Moses crossed the desert  
With a band of weary men  
For forty years they wandered through  
The hot and burning sand  
And Moses went and prayed alone  
The weary vagabond  
And lightning wrote these words in stone  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Jesus stumbling through the streets  
On the road to Calvary  
Nailed high to testify  
With other local thieves  
And as they hung there dying  
One asked what lay beyond  
That all depends the master said  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Some men work for little things  
And some men work for more  
Some men work for anything  
And some don't work at all  
And me myself I'm satisfied  
To sing for God's own son  
And ask you what I ask myself  
Which side are you on

With my friends and my companions by my side  
And I think of you wherever I do go  
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy

Won't be long till I am home again with you  
Just a few more miles to go  
Won't be long till I can get back on my own  
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you  
  
In the airport I'm standing in a line  
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright  
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time  
To be in some other town most every night

Oh, I miss the singing from porch banjo nights  
And when friends come by to pass the time away  
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night  
Heading east through Massachusetts toward the bay

Arlo Guthrie,World Away From Me,/a/arlo+guthrie/world+away+from+me_20347156.html,"I've been keeping on the run  
I've been traveling with the sun  
I've been singing all my life and getting by  
Got to keep up with what's going on  
In this place I've been so long  
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life  
And it's so good to come home  
To a woman all alone  
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
I'll be coming home at night  
While the kids are sleeping tight  
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine  
And the kids jump out of bed  
Hello Daddy, what did you get  
Did you think of anything on down the line  
She'll be talking with her smile  
Saying, honey, wait awhile  
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
Oh the prophets and the sages  
And the wise men through the ages  
All that's written down on pages from above  
Just can't adequately describe  
What I'm feeling here inside  
It's just useless to be living without love  
And I'll take her by her hand  
Just a woman and a man  
Without trying to understand what we should be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

Music by Charlie Chaplin  
My love, you are the song  
That sings inside of me  
The song is always the same  
It starts with love and ends with your name  
The more that I love you  
There's more in you to love  
And yet I just don't know how  
I could love you more than I do right now  
They say that love grows old  
But our love turned to gold  
You kissed my sorrows away  
You touched my heart  
What more can I say  
Each day my life is new  
For God blessed me with you  
And when my life is all through  
Without a word you always knew  
That all my life my life was you

I end up with a grubby shrub with a case of blight

Spend hours in the basement until I find the crate  
Of lights and bulbs and popcorn strings, tangled in a knot  
Then I spend the day separating what I've got

It's three days till Christmas, I spent all day writing cards  
I started writing letters now I just say ""best regards""  
I shove 'em in a mailbox and to the mall I go  
To get gifts for Jim and Jane and Tim and Uncle Joe (and aunt Mavis and
Grandma and

Two days till Christmas, a million things to do  
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due  
Where are my in-laws, they should have shown up  
I bet they're at the airport I forgot to pick them up

Christmas is here

Spend all day serving company, then fall down inert

When Daddy barked on her face  
So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too

I would swim the widest sea  
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground  
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos  
I would catch a storm of killer bees  
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword

But I might get hurt

Or say I'll full of fright  
You might call me yellow

I'd even grab a tiger by the tail

A boxing champion's mother  
But my courage and my bowels both would fail  
I would fight off a bunch  
Of angry Kosacks

Too dangerous  
Too dangerous

Having fun is bad for you!  
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes  
Because I found that they are a major cause of death

Picturesque powered pistons...  
Accellerating automotive alarms...  
Stunningly stupifying stereo stunts!  
One man... A dream... A car... A 1984... Plymouth... Horizon...  
  
I loved the car from tail to grill  
I wouldn't change a thing  
I wouldn't trade the ashtray  
For the Queen's engagement ring  
But things they started going wrong  
And went from bad to worse  
The clutch went kinda funny  
Then I couldn't use reverse  
Still I loved my baby  
And would not admit defeat  
Just because it left a trail  
Of rust along the street  
It kept on running bravely  
On duct tape and a prayer  
Plus a monthly tribute to  
The guy who did repairs  
It all seems so unfair (The man was glad the day he bought)  
  
Horizon!  
Horizon!  
  
Till one day on the parking lot  
They called 401  
My car became the meat between  
A Buick-Honda bun  
I saw some parts go flying  
That you really need to drive  
My car had become roadkill  
Though it never was alive  
Left a muffler in the passing lane  
A hubcap in the slow  
The windshield on the median  
A headlight in the snow  
And as I skidded off the road  
The other drivers laughed  
My middle-finger greeting  
Would be my epitaph  
Death would come at last (Here lies the man who dared to buy)  
  
Horizon!  
  
Now I look at my bent fender  
The twisted wheel rim  
I wonder if Horizon  
Will ever drive again  
But I know that this was not the end  
Road warriors die hard  
And I signed this Mr. Iacoca's  
Organ donor card  
The steel will get recycled  
And they'll build another car  
Bigger, faster, stronger  
An automotive star  
My quest will then begin  
And revenge will soon be mine  
As I drive my gleaming three-door  
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein  
Searching for that Buick  
To try to end it's days  
We'll settle off the score  
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)

He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around

My optic nerves are only seeing blue  
My blood hates to flow

The metallurgist is the musicians best friend. This statement  
Has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we  
Could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine  
Tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the  
Wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with  
Progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,  
Is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,  
And seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or  
Plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You  
Put the milk in later.

Watery graves are my stock and trade, but it's getting harder  
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  
There hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965  
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive  
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  
They pass by, the boat survives, only my career's in tatters  
They're building ships too good today, and I'm the one who suffers  
They don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
There once were found, twenty in town, who wrote about shipwrecks  
When boats sank lots, just like rocks, 'twas good as it gets  
But the golden ages passed away and I'm barely survivin'  
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin' in advertisin'  
They're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me  
Why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  
You may think it well and good, but my livelihood sails away  
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  
That government bastard's been sent to take my job from me  
That inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy  
He can try, no way will I ever give up hope  
When he went by, I did pry a big hole in his boat  
They're building ships too good today, so I helped one along  
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  
Of a man afloat a sinking boat, who knows he will die today

I'll not fill up the tank although I'm going far  
And if somebody asks me if I'm going to a bar  
I'll say I'm shopping 'cross the border in the usa  
I do not go down there to buy my groceries  
I respect our farmers and our factories  
I don't believe that local means it's poor in quality  
It's just our goddamned prices are too high

I get one hundred dollars duty-free  
(Though it adds two more, will I claim it or)  
I don't declare the products if they're in my trunk  
(He won't declare the products if they're in his trunk)  
Although it is Canada that I call home  
I don't cheer for the Yankees when I'm in the dome  
I didn't swell with pride during the desert storm  
It's just that I don't want to pay the tax  
(It's just that he's too cheap to pay the tax)  
(Yes it's just like this, he's a loyalist)  
I'll only shop at malls that fly our flag  
(And he'll tell Bob Ray that he just won't pay)  
Unless I need my unemployment benefits  
(Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!)  
Now everybody's doing the same thing as me  
They're doing what they can to beat the gst  
They're lining up for miles at the duty-free  
So I bought a J. C. Penney store in Buffalo  
(So everybody come on down to Buffalo)

You'll get one hundred dollars duty free

To get the things that you want to own  
You just have to get a loan

Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store

God above for creating the banks  
They have been so kind to me  
With their bounless generosity  
  
If you cannot make your payments  
Well, do like the national governments  
And you can pay off what you owe  
By taking out a bigger loan  
  
You gotta put it on credit and then forget it  
Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
Now I seem to have men after me  
From the collection agency  
And the bank came by the other day  
Took everything I own away  
  
Now I think that it is plain to see  
That I must declare bankruptcy  
But things aren't really all that bad  
I can borrow from my dad

survived, it's songs and dances passed from father to son, from mother to

language of the Celts, all hearts are still stirred by the beautiful tones of
this mellifluous tongue.

And though other cultures tried to destroy them, driven no doubt by their
jealousy of the Celts' fine fashion sense and edible cuisine, they did not
surrender. Actually, they surrendered quite often, but they were never
entirely wiped out, clinging to the corners of small islands, their voices
raised in song, the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens.

Arrogant Worms,The Last Saskatchewan Pirate,/a/arrogant+worms/the+last+saskatchewan+pirate_20009381.html,"I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine  
I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line  
But times were hard, and though I tried, the money wasn't there  
And bankers came and took my land, and told me ""fair is fair"".  
  
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no  
""Hire you now,"" they'd always laugh, ""we just let twenty go!""  
The government they promised me a measly little sum  
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum  
  
Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,  
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
You'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large  
But just the other day I saw an unsuspecting barge  
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser  
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.  
  
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river  
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver  
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is waiting in the bay,  
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors

Well, Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat  
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,  
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job  
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.  
  
A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,  
I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T. (Screw it!)  
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, the terror of the sea  
If you want to reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here  
I heard that in Alberta there's a band of buccaneers  
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay  
And you're bound to lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way  
  
Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze  
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze  
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've got to go  
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.

But if something's rotten in this state  
It's just his fishy breath

William Shakespeare's in my cat  
He rarely ever talks  
He makes his loudest statements  
Standing in the litter box  
He sleeps on all my shelves  
And throws my books about the house

When he bats a squeaky mouse  
Sam Beckett's plays are witty,

Oscar Wilde is pretty,

We had the best years of our lives,

September took me by surprise,  
And I was left to watch the seasons change.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (3x)  
  
It's been so quiet since you're gone,  
And everyday feels more like a year,  
Sometimes I wish I could move on,  
The memories would all just disappear.  
  
So many things I should've,  
Said when I had the chance,  
So many times we took it all for granted.  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'd never thought this could ever end,  
I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,  
Everything is different now,  
Can we stop the world from turning?  
  
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,  
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,  
I Wish I could go back,  
And we'd stop the world from turning.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (2x)  
  
Looking back on better days,  
When we were young, we thought we knew so much.  
And now it seems so far away,  
I'm wondering If I was good enough.

Said when I had the chance,  
So many times we took it all for granted.

I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,  
I Wish I could go back,  
And we'd stop the world from turning.  
  
Gone are all the days,  
When we swore we'd never break,  
And now I'm left here alone.  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... (3x)

If we don't get harassed by the motherfuckin' cops  
Quarter tank of gas  
About a half a pack  
My cell phone's dyin' but there's no turnin' back  
I can feel the breeze  
Steerin' with my knee  
Drummin' on the dashboard  
Bumpin' to the beat  
Hit the windshield wiper  
Searchin' for my lighter  
I gotta get right before this all nighter

Avril Lavigne,Breakaway (Written For Kelly Clarkson),/a/avril+lavigne/breakaway+written+for+kelly+clarkson_20517942.html,"Grew up in a small town,  
And when the rain would fall down,  
I'd just stare out my window.  
  
Dreaming of what could be,  
And if I'd end up happy.  
I would pray.  
  
Trying not to reach out  
But when I try to speakout  
Felt like no one could hear me  
  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Wanna feel the warm breeze.  
Sleep under a palm tree.  
Feel the rush of the ocean.  
Get onboard a fast train.  
Travel on a jetplane.  
Far away,  
And break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors.  
Swinging with revolving doors.  
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me.  
Gotta keep movin on movin on.  
Fly away,  
Break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye,  
Take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget the place I come from,  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
I should Breakaway.  
Break away.

And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react

I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend

From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you  
And your life lost, so young, so new

That so many would lose their sleep tonight

You couldn't say goodbye before you go

Don't get caught,  
Sneak out of the house.

Can't help if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way,  
I may switch off and go in a daydream,  
  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
But sometimes I can't even speak,  
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

We talk about the day  
When you found out he was cheating  
You tell me that it hurts to the bone  
To trust someone that way  
To find out he was decieving  
And I know I've always just been your friend  
But if you look my way I'll make sure that you'll never hurt again  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you'd only see  
How beautiful you and I would be  
Endlessly  
  
Ohhh ohh yea  
I remember when you fell in love  
I could not believe  
That it was not with me  
I said a secret prayer up above  
And put my heart away  
So that you could be free  
And I know right now your broken in two  
But did you know my hearts been broken since the day i met you  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And in my sweetest dream you'd learn to put your faith in me  
Endlessly

If you put your faith in me  
How beautiful you and I would be

Is when your heart's lost  
And the only thing that's worth the pain  
Is the price of what love costs  
Coz when you think it's all in your hands  
That's when it's gone  
And you're thinking you're invincible  
Believe me, you're so wrong  
Tell me how does it feel

Just a picture on the wall

Someone who listened when I called

So many things I should have said to you  
I had the chance and let it slip away  
If I could fly to heaven (if I could fly up)  
Just to see you one more time (just to see you one more time)  
I'd fly all the way to heaven (to heaven)  
Just to say that I love you  
The last three words you said to me  
I love you  
Remain an echo in my mind (remain an echo in my mind)  
Never imagined that you'd leave so soon  
I will miss you sweet Caroline

In her eyes  
She wraps the truth  
Inside her lies  
Just when I can't say  
What she's done to me  
She comes to me  
And leads me back to paradise  
  
She's so hard to hold  
But I can't let go

I'm a house of cards  
In a hurricane  
A reckless ride  
In the pouring rain  
She cuts me and the pain  
Is all I wanna feel  
She tears away just like a child  
She drives me crazy  
Drives me wild  
But I'm helpless when she smiles  
  
Oh when she smiles  
  
Maybe I'd fight if I could  
It hurts so bad  
But feels so good  
She opens up just like  
A rose to me  
When she's close to me  
Anything she'd ask me to  
I would  
  
It's out of control

Standing there to be my bride and then there's you  
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes  
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know

But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch  
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for  
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world

And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
First time it rings  
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you  
That moment I knew  
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice  
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us  
  
Every single night feels like 25 to life  
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven  
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
So let me make my case  
That way you won't erase the message  
That I'm leaving for you now  
But if you do at least you knew  
  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home

Always be my one phone call  
  
You'll always be my one  
You'll always be my one

Am I over her?

It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days  
Since the last time I seen your pretty face  
My decision to bring this to an end  
And I'm caught up in reminscing  
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks  
Play fights, late nights  
It's been on my mind since Valentine's  
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide

Am I over her? (am I over her?)

Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)

Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain  
Now my situation's taking a big change  
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town  
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around  
Is she sad or is she mad?  
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?  
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on  
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone

It's water under the bridge  
But I can't seem to forget

The fundamental things apply,  
  
As time goes by.  
And when two lovers woo,  
They still say ""i love you,""  
On that you can rely,  
  
No matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by.  
  
Moonlight and love songs,  
Never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion,  
Jealousy and hate,  
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,  
There's no one can deny.  
  
It's still the same old story,  
A fight for love and glory,  
A case of do or die,  
The world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by.

Barbra Streisand,Ask Yourself Why,/b/barbra+streisand/ask+yourself+why_20013268.html,"When you're just out walking and you pass  
Little signs that say ""keep off the grass""  
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?  
Pretty playgrounds children used to know  
Little squares where lovers love to go  
Disappear so parking lots can grow  
Why?  
  
Once you start the questions never cease  
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace  
Pets and children are prohibited  
  
Why? ask yourself why?  
And when you think about it  
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen  
Recommended wholesome nice and clean  
Making love's the thing that can't be seen  
Why?  
  
Let your hair down just an inch or two  
Let your skin be red or green or blue  
They invent a special name for you  
Why?  
  
On a clear day oh say can you see  
What remains of mountain's scenery  
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery, sky,  
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny  
So when you're out walking and you pass  
Near a sign that say ""keep off the grass""  
Put a sign right next to it that says ""why?""

Gets old answering questions why and trying to explain  
Why I prefer to stay at home with friends and entertain

Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
I just read in the papers that I bought some birds today  
Flying all around my house  
Just havin' their own sweet way  
It makes me feel so foolish 'cause they called my house a cage  
But there's nothing I can do  
Just puts me in a rage  
Don't believe it

Four little angels of peace are we  
Loving our neighbors so peacefully  
There's really no harm if we do not disarm  
For we always in close harmony  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
With fall or with friend  
We will fight to the end  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Though we butchered the boss  
And I've own made the choice  
And slaughter the irish no end  
Though I'm injured and poor  
Slaying hoard upon hoard  
We're but playing the part of a friend  
Yes, our arms we ain't twist  
But we'll be elected for peace  
Except in the case of the crook  
We conquered both spears  
Now we're up to our ears  
Just trying to keep what we took  
Three little angels of peace are we  
Living together so blissfully  
Oh, we never fight unless  
We're on the right  
But we're always in the right, you see?  
Three little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
Until we are wrecks  
We'll break each other's necks  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
In japan we've the right  
In a generous night  
But the emperor knows peace is finer  
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd  
We're picked down and buried by china  
Oh, how we're deplored  
I glad did it for the world  
We're a nation of poets and thinkers  
Also, though we bound without pity  
And lay west to his city  
It's because all the chinese are stinkers  
Two little angels of peace are we  
Living together in amity  
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack  
But it's just a mere formality  
Two little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We try to keep calm  
When we gas, we bump  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Now I know that our war  
Is a thing to have horror  
And that peaceful fill out  
When we hope we have  
With our love from the start  
I atrocious did all my part  
To civilize nearly the hope we have  
Though you call me sadistic  
Imperialistic  
My armies required a quarry  
And though we may slave  
What's a splendid day today  
After all that we'll say that we're sorry  
Though I fall for the urge  
Of a nice bloody purge  
And living my way I was carrying on  
Though I clean up my schmutz  
Would I hear nazi putz  
It is all for the sake of the aryan  
My ambitions are small  
I want nothing at all  
My plans wouldn't be any littler  
Now that austria's nazi  
It will be hazy-gazy  
To put the whole world under hitler  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Drinking with older of saintity  
Though we slaughter the meek  
We confirm every week  
And we talk it over peacefully  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We'll shout and we'll shell  
We'll get each other's hell  
Just for peace, peace, peace...

Rsvp peonies, pollinate the breeze,  
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy  
Come give at least a preview of Easter  
Come up and see the good we're giving  
Come up and see the grounds for living  
Come poke your head out,  
Open up and spread out,  
Hurry it's lovely here!

On top of the world  
  
Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around  
Everybody tries it once  
Those who don't just have to put it down  
You paddle out turn around and raise  
And baby that's all there is  
To the coastline craze  
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin'  
On top of the world  
  
Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long  
All the surfers going strong  
They said it wouldn't last too long  
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon  
And watch 'em they'll hit the road  
And all be surfin' soon  
And when they catch a wave they'll be  
Sittin' on top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world  
  
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy  
Get yourself a big board  
But don't you treat it like a toy  
Just get away from the shady turf  
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf  
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin  
On top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'

In my bed I'm snuggling  
Outside my window

The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed

A pudgy person somehow did appear  
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat  
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at  
A big pot and tripley chin  
Oh what condition my condition was in  
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame  
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame  
Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too  
Aren't always good as they seem  
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too  
That's what you get when you eat that way  
I read a book on organic foods  
Jumped on a health food kick  
Put me in the mood  
You may not get to perfect overnight  
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight  
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd  
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word  
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today  
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way  
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat  
With carrot juice to wash it all down  
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat  
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town  
H.-E.-L.-P.  
H.E.L.P. your education creates much benefit and peace  
Hamburgers and hot dogs throw 'em all out  
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout  
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today  
And 'member now that H.E.L.P. 's on its way

So I must be on my way

In the morning it will fade away  
Daylight is good  
At arriving at the right time  
It's not always going to be this grey

This is the dress that I made  
This is the child I brought up

This is the perfume I wore  
This is the hotel we stayed  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid  
This is the woman you laid  
We promise ourselves this is no one-night stand  
Let us draw all the curtains and strike up the band  
And I'm thrilled by gentlest touch of your hand we pretend  
There's a tear, there's a tear  
Not through confusion through fear, through fear  
This is the smile that I wore  
This is the song that we played  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid, this is the woman you laid  
Next morning our eyes filled with sleepy regret  
A kiss and goodbye and a long cigarette  
But the pillow I lay on is cold and it's wet  
Can't pretend  
It's a tear, it's a tear  
Not through confusion, through fear, through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
Roll out the red carpets and unplug the phone  
Root out the photos you've already shown  
'cause this is one night you won't sleep alone  
Just one night  
There's a tear there's a tear  
Not through confusion through fear, through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
There's a tear, there's a tear  
Not through confusion, through fear  
Not through confusion, through fear.

Yes it was frantic, it was young, it was sweet  
But a sweet worth every bite  
  
Now I'm not normally one to be greedy  
But I had to be greedy with you  
5 days, 6 days. the whole of the month  
wouldn't satisfy my only sweet tooth

Well it can take many years to forge a friendship  
It can take a lifetime to get close  
But we took all the shortcuts,  
used our hearts as a map  
and we still got closer than most  
  
hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
  
Well excuse my staring but it's just your looks  
are a standard well above myself  
Your face might mean zip to you  
But to me it's something else  
  
All I can do is thank you  
and wish that every dream you have will come true  
5 years, 6 years, the whole of your life  
I'll be wishing for the riches for you

You dashed pretty's only chance of a compliment  
and gave the plain the blues  
Turned supermodel into last year's pull  
and got her down shining your shoes  
  
And I don't mean to be hod carrier  
of the ordinary folks bad news  
But tell Miss World to fly to Mars  
If she really doesn't like to lose.

you'd make cheap sex look so regal  
Make the hottest little joint in town look like frost

It took a blinkered vision for a long lost cause  
As Romeo leaves to light applause

My attitude leaves a lot to be desired  
My fashion sense has never been quite right  
But I'd rather live in drainpipes  
Than with friends that I've acquired

That criminal fizz in the drink he pours  
We smooch all night to ""The Theme From Jaws""

Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz

If I look sad I am

To fill an autumn

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep.  
They just lie there and they die there.  
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw

Beautiful South,The Next Verse,/b/beautiful+south/the+next+verse_20592264.html,"There was a pool table there at the wedding  
That most of the men stood and played  
Whilst the women danced in their melancholy  
Till the last record started to fade  
And as D. J. Turned the lights up  
And packed his records away  
He noticed a lonely figure still there  
So quietly turned to say  
  
Tears you thought lasted a lifetime  
Won't last too much more than a day  
And you'll prove that you still have your strength left  
When you wipe those tears well away, well away  
  
Roses in garden bring joy to the bleak  
Lilies save wretched from worse  
Music lifts up those too weary to speak  
So, sister you sing the next verse  
  
The path in life that you have taken  
I can figure out just from your frown  
Either it's down the up escalator  
Or maybe sometimes up the down  
And you may not feel that you have travelled  
But sure as hell been across town  
And certainly if story unravelled  
You've lost more than you ever found  
  
One thing's for certain I've travelled  
And a not too dissimilar route  
Those ups and downs and rounds after rounds  
You're wearing them just like a suit, like a suit  
  
So if roses bring joy to the bleak  
Lilies save wretched from worse  
Music lifts up those too weary to speak  
Then D. J. I'll take the next verse  
  
So sister judge strength not by muscle  
Or weight that your body can lift  
But by heavyweight heart that you carry  
That no other young woman could shift  
Hey Mr D. J. A special request  
Play that last record for me  
And make it as long and as painfully sad  
As any slow ballad could be

Isn't police sirens wailing  
It's the sound of Wall Street tills  
Whilst everyone is failing  
  
Sometimes you feel expensive  
Sometimes you feels so cheap

Whilst everyone's asleep

With a hairbrush or a spoon

And a couple of stone thinner  
And if anyone came toward him

It's the sound of shuffling feet

And in every underpass, on every street  
A promise someone made but couldn't keep  
A tiny piece of chalk in every coat  
In every film the smallest lump in throat  
In every song you've sung in every novel read

That replaced the reign of gold  
Couldn't have known that you  
Would feel so undersold  
If love was built on hindsight  
Then you surely would have seen  
You were joining hands  
With the Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But can you choose a Queen  
When you behave like a drone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainly never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
I didn't mean to fool you  
Into feeling King  
Of anything but plastic  
And what plastic brings  
If gold is what she had  
It's what I could've been  
The unaffordable dream  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But don't expect a gem  
When you're quarrying for stone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainty never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
In future when that moan  
Has turned to prone  
And the slightest groan  
Feels so overblown  
Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb  
Runs the honeycomb

Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb

No ""Pardon"" when I heard them ask  
Just a vodaphone and a filofax  
  
When I'm 64

Stop him for hours at their front gate  
He just sits and thinks  
I'll make the bastard wait  
  
No dribbling or incontinence  
No longing for the old sixpence  
Just smoking weed till age makes sense

Just for the cheap companionship  
Meanwhile he counts pennies  
For a different trip  
  
No smoking pipes and drinking bitter  
No eyeing up the baby sitter

I'd love to see you smile upon my face,  
Without a fear  
  
And when you've smiled your fear away  
There's something more you'd bring  
The gift of gifts, remembering  
How I first learned to sing...  
  
Both:  
La la la la, it's Christmas time  
Memories everywhere  
Singing of hope, peace to mankind  
And love is in the air.  
  
And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start  
To make the prayers the children pray  
Come true in all our hearts...

Beauty And The Beast,Prologue (The Enchantress),/b/beauty+and+the+beast/prologue+the+enchantress_20623203.html,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,  
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.  
Although he had everything his heart desired,  
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  
But then, one winter's night,  
An old beggar woman came to the castle  
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.  
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  
The Prince sneered at the gift,  
And turned the old woman away.  
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  
For Beauty is found within.  
And when he dismissed her again,  
The old woman's ugliness melted away  
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.  
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.  
And as punishment,  
She transformed him into a hideous beast,  
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,  
And all who lived there.  
Ashamed of his monstrous form,  
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,  
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  
The Rose she had offered,  
Was truly an enchanted rose,  
Which would bloom for many years.  
If he could learn to love another,  
And earn her love in return  
By the time the last petal fell,  
Then the spell would be broken.  
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast  
For all time.  
As the years passed,  
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,  
For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?

Wishing this picture be reality.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
The lord took you away.  
And if you could see me today.  
I will remember you.  
I will remember you.  
  
My dearest, sincerest,  
There's no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
You're my dearest too.

Late December back in sixty-three.  
What a very special time for me.  
I'll remember what a night.  
  
Oh what a night!  
No I didn't even know her name,  
But I'm never gonna be the same.  
What a lady, what a night!  
  
Oh I, I had a funny feeling when she walked into the room.  
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon.  
Oh what a night!  
  
Hypnotized and mesmorizing me.  
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surender, what a night!  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under,  
Oh what a night!  
  
Why'd it take so long to see the light.  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seemed so right.  
What a lady, what a night!

With the American dream  
And I was born too soon  
A little good luck, never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin, she got a city block  
And she was barkin' at the moon

So many sides to her  
And I'd be the one to know

She can double it up  
And she's a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin' in the fire  
White steam, never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know

Bee Gees,Dogs,/b/bee+gees/dogs_20015828.html,"1974  
I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old  
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be  
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark  
Keeping other dogs like him for company  
  
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town  
Try to get some bread to make another way  
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow  
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day  
  
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73  
When I heard somebody call outside my door  
Said ""Are you friend or are you foe""  
He looked up and he said ""no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more""  
  
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind
