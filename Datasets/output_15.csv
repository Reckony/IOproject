Nick Cave,The Lyre Of Orpheus,/n/nick+cave/the+lyre+of+orpheus_20483116.html,"Orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed  
Wondering what to do  
With a lump of wood, a piece of wire  
And a little pot of glue  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He sawed at the wood with half a heart  
And glued it top to bottom  
He strung a wire in between  
He was feeling something rotten  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus looked at his instrument  
And he gave the wire a pluck  
He heard a sound so beautiful  
He gasped and said O my God  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He rushed inside to tell his wife  
He went racing down the halls  
Eurydice was still asleep in bed  
Like a sack of cannonballs  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Look what I've made, cried Orpheus  
And he plucked a gentle note  
Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets  
And her tongue burst through her throat  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
O God, what have I done, he said  
As her blood pooled in the sheets  
But in his heart he felt a bliss  
With which nothing could compete  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus went leaping through the fields  
Strumming as hard as he did please  
Birdies detonated in the sky  
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled  
He hit a G minor 7  
He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep  
God was a major player in heaven  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
God picked up a giant hammer  
And He threw it with an thunderous yell  
It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head  
And knocked him down a well  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
The well went down very deep  
Very deep went down the well  
The well went down so very deep  
Well, the well went down to hell  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start  
All amongst the rotting dead  
His lyre tacked safe under his arm  
His brains all down his head  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood  
And she said to Orpheus  
If you play that fucking thing down here  
I'll stick it up your orifice!  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus  
It's enough to send you bats  
Let's stay down here, Eurydice, dear  
And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time  
He was on a real low down bummer  
And stared deep into the abyss and said  
This one is for Mamma  
  
O Mamma O Mamma  
O Mamma O Mamma

And the poor would die

Your phone number to mine  
You said that you were movin' in  
But you needed a little time  
So I kept all your messages  
Til you made up your mind  
Now the rain is fallin' and the clouds are gathering  
And the sun refuse to shine  
Your promises and whispered words  
Are forever on my mind  
And I'm left here smokin' cigarettes

Nick Drake,Saturday Sun,/n/nick+drake/saturday+sun_20100340.html,"Saturday sun came early one morning  
In a sky so clear and blue  
Saturday sun came without warning  
So no-one knew what to do  
Saturday sun brought people and faces  
That didn't seem much in their day  
But when I remembered those people and places  
They were really too good in their way  
In their way  
In their way  
Saturday sun won't come and see me today  
  
Think about stories with reason and rhyme  
Circling through your brain  
And think about people in their season and time  
Returning again and again  
And again  
And again  
but Saturday sun has turned to Sunday's rain

Nick Drake,Things Behind The Sun,/n/nick+drake/things+behind+the+sun_20100354.html,"Please beware of them that stare  
They'll only smile to see you while  
Your time away  
And once you've seen what they have been  
To win the earth just won't seem worth  
Your night or your day  
Who'll hear what I say.  
Look around you find the ground  
Is not so far from where you are  
But not too wise  
For down below they never grow  
They're always tired and charms are hired  
From out of their eyes  
Never surprise.  
  
Take your time and you'll be fine  
And say a prayer for people there  
Who live on the floor  
And if you see what's meant to be  
Don't name the day or try to say  
It happened before.  
  
Don't be shy you learn to fly  
And see the sun when day is done  
If only you see  
Just what you are beneath a star  
That came to stay one rainy day  
In autumn for free  
Yes, be what you'll be.  
Please beware of them that stare  
They'll only smile to see you while  
Your time away  
And once you've seen what they have been  
To win the earth just won't seem worth  
Your night or your day  
Who'll hear what I say.  
  
Open up the broken cup  
Let goodly sin and sunshine in  
Yes that's today.  
And open wide the hymns you hide  
You find renown while people frown  
At things that you say  
But say what you'll say  
About the farmers and the fun  
And the things behind the sun  
And the people around your head  
Who say everything's been said  
And the movement in your brain  
Sends you out into the rain.

A kid from a western town  
Wants to be seen and go out  
Let's borrow my parent's car  
Let's stay out all night up there  
And Burnside will be our street  
Where the kids and the hookers meet  
Diners and strip club junk  
Bookstores and punk rock clubs

Just hang on until the summer, it's hot  
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)  
We'll make our home water-tight  
Work all day, play all night  
And hope we're not washed away  
By deceit or tragedy  
And Joan of Arc rules Northeast  
Where the poor and the hipsters meet  
The grid that divides us all  
The river makes final call  
Out at the edge of town  
Where airfield runs water down  
Coyote crosses the tracks

Cross the river to the east side  
Find me on the eve of suicide  
Tell me the city is no place to hide  
Take me out into a sunny day  
Through the grotto or the promenade  
You came to me in the nick of time  
Thankful for the things I left behind

And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear

By now, no doubt that we were heading south

And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""

Would you live each moment like your last?  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?

Against the grain should be a way of life

Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?  
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars  
Regardless of who you are  
So do whatever it takes  
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life  
Let nothin' stand in your way  
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

With scars on both his lips, his fingertips,  
Were melted to the bone.

When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night.

To take all you've got and burn it on the spot,  
Just to get high,(high)  
  
Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating,  
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing,  
And pretended not to know,  
He started stealing, to supply the feeling,  
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife,  
And held it to her throat.

Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?

Mother's hands are serving meals  
In a cafe on Main Street  
With mouths to feed  
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs

Is how it's so bad, it's so bad  
  
It's too bad it's too bad  
Too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk

You left without saying goodbye  
Although I'm sure you tried  
You'd call the house from time to time  
To make sure we're alive  
But you weren't there  
Right when I needed you the most  
And now I dream about it  
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

Too late, so wrong, so long

Father's hands are lined with guilt  
For tearing us apart  
Guess it turned out in the end  
Just look at where we are  
We made it out  
We still got clothing on our backs  
And now I scream about it  
And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent  
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since  
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent  
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant  
Cherish these nights, cherish these people  
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel  
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful  
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool  
Cherish these days, man do they go quick  
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06  
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed  
I look down, ""yes I suppose""  
  
[Hook]  
All things go, all things go  
All things go, all things go  
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone  
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls  
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong  
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young  
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know, we know, say ""fuck the world"", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence  
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him  
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?  
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same  
Even though they know that I love him  
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me  
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me  
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 3]  
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business  
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas  
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me  
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness  
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact  
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that  
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective  
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected  
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""  
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute  
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them  
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him  
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him  
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him  
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint

Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake  
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge

How do you  
How do you  
  
You let me win,  
You let me ride  
You let me rock  
You let me slide  
And when they lookin'  
You let me hide.  
Defend my honor  
Protect my pride.  
The good advice  
I always hated  
But looking back  
It made me greater.  
You always told me  
Forget the haters  
Just get my money,  
Just get my weight up.  
Know when I'm lying,  
Know when I'm crying  
It's like you got it  
Down to a science  
Why am I trying  
No you ain't buying,  
I tried to fight it  
Back with defiance.  
You make me laugh  
You make me hoarse

And getting at you  
Picking up dishes  
Throwing them at you.  
Why are you speaking  
When no one asked you.

And you start leaving

Always get the reaction you wanted  
I'm actually fronting  
I'm askin' you something  
Yo, answer this question,  
Class is in session,  
Tired of letting  
Passive aggression  
Control my mind,  
Capture my soul  
OK your right  
Just let it go.  
OK you got it,  
Its in the can.  
Before I played it  
You knew my hand.  
You could turn a free throw into a goal.  
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul.

Stop,  
Stop,  
Would you just stop looking through me  
Cause I just cant take it.  
No I cant take it.

Embroidery of the stars  
Undress my feelings for this earth  
Send me your saliva to heal my scars  
And let this nakedness be my birth  
  
Macrocosm poured its powers on me  
And the hopes of this world I now must leave  
The night wish I sent you centuries ago  
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe  
  
The distance of our bridal bed  
Await for me to be dead  
Dust of the galaxies take my hand  
Lead me to my beloved's land  
  
Departed by the guillotine of death  
I received a letter from the depth  
The dream of my lover it carried inside  
  
Caressed by the sharpest knife  
I asked you to be my wife  
Rays of the setting sun  
Were my tears wept upon promises undone  
  
Come to me  
Make me believe  
To you and your love again  
  
Above the universe  
Beneath the great eye  
I shall desire you forevermore

Mindless ghouls with lots of limbs to lose

Tightrope - walkers thightening the noose

Laughing harpies with their tallons ripping  
Sher-chrisss, per-vizz

Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner  
Fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders

The razors on your seducing skin  
In the meadow of sinful thoughts  
Every flower's perfect

A burning veil

Among the garbage and the flowers

There are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love  
And they will lean that way forever  
  
While Suzanne holds the mirror  
And you want to travel with her

In a flock of a thou'

Together did blend  
Forming chords of awakening

For they shouted  
Never again would they fly  
In such numbers across  
Such a primitive sky  
And they noticed my heart  
As it sank to the sand

Tangled up in her raven hair  
I should've known but I didn't care  
She'd be gone by the light of day  
  
Cause her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars fell all around her  
Well did I see you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
  
Now the sun dances across my room  
I can smell the wine and her soft perfume  
The only thing that lets me know  
That an angel wasn't here  
  
You know I had this crazy dream  
She flew away on stolen wings  
But all she took was a pair of jeans  
When see saw that the coast was clear  
  
And her eyes were shining brighter

a radio was playing though we never heard a word (I don't

but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd  
and harkning  
(a heightening) intensity? for silence did I beg  
oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs  
  
I couldn't quite believe it for it sounded rather strange  
the instruments were different and the key had been changed

Up the highway through the past  
I was torn betwwen the future

Fell in love for the wrong reasons  
Gave our hearts then lost control  
So I eased it up past sixty  
Turn away and let it roll  
  
We had the plan to stay together  
You with your dreams me with mine  
With the promess of forever  
We would stand the test of time  
  
Like the hot winds come in summer  
Trouble waited at the door  
Time to leave this all behind me

Let it roll the way these heart aches  
Let it roll away theses fears  
Let it roll away the reasons  
We've been crying all these years  
  
Every mile that comes between us  
There's a cleansing in my soul  
Throw away the rear view mirror  
Adios and let it roll  
  
Now everybody takes their chances  
Everybody has to choose  
But when love hangs in the balance  
There's an innocence you lose  
  
I don't know what lies before me  
But I'm sure I have to go  
Feel the tears slowly descending

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods

But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.  
  
When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.  
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion,  
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back  
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.  
  
But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,  
And somewhere in between I must have grown  
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.  
  
Now I know, it's a long hard road  
  
Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,  
When the sun-up came, we got up and went  
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent  
Singin' songs along with gramma's radio.  
  
Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,  
Livin' in my memories all in vain  
'cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like  
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.  
  
Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,  
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.  
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.  
  
Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road  
Yes, I know, it's a long hard road.

Love was the first thing we prized  
So unexpectedly became a thief  
I heard these things happen  
But never to me  
Left me walking in shadows  
Stumblin' blind  
Searching for ways to get by  
Got to find me a girl  
Who can change my world  
And make, make it all worthwhile  
Take it all away  
And my heart see clear  
Love is the last thing  
It's just the last thing  
Love is the last thing to go  
See all the lights laid out  
Below my feet  
The city's so quiet tonight  
Someone is waiting for me down there  
It's time to get back in this life  
Got to find me a girl  
Who can change my world  
And make, make it all worthwhile  
Take it all away  
And it's all so clear

Take the gold into telluride  
I'd like to lay you down on a cannonball bed  
Put a soft feather pillow down by your head  
Intertwine flowers into a maiden's veil  
Wake you in the morning  
Now she's wailing take the gold into telluride  
Ain't nothing'll stop an avalanche when it's sliding  
Once the wagon starts to roll, you can't turn the mule and the brakes don't
hold  
You end up in the valley with the little one by your side  
Take the gold into telluride  
Lace curtains for the windows  
Dreams torn from a catalog page  
We may wander where the wind blows  
You change your views but our love won't change  
She gonna climb you high on top of a hill  
Fall asleep laughing with the whipporwill  
Intertwined flowers in the matrons ring  
Wake you in the morning  
Now she's singing take the gold into telluride  
I loved my winter with a teenage bride  
Dreamin of what we'll do  
When the snow finally ends  
And the spring breaks through  
We'll load up the wagon, set the little one by our side  
Take the gold into telluride

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Tennessee Stud,/n/nitty+gritty+dirt+band/tennessee+stud_20482604.html,"Along about eighteen twenty-five  
I left Tennessee very much alive  
And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud  
If I hadn't been a-ridin that Tennessee stud  
  
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa  
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw  
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud  
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud  
  
Chorus:  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
We drifted on down into no man's land  
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande  
I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal  
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold  
  
Me and the gambler we couldn't agree  
We got in a fight over Tennessee  
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud  
And I got away on the Tennessee stud  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be  
A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee  
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue  
Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too  
  
We loped right back across Arkansas  
I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa  
When I found that girl with the golden hair  
And she was A-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side  
We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide  
We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood  
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud  
  
There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor  
A little hoss colt playin' 'round the door  
I love the girl with golden hair  
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They'se good hosses)  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
And he had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

As the days disappeared far too soon.  
Now I wandered much further today than I should,  
And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood.  
So help me if you can, I've got to get  
  
Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one.  
You'll be surprised, there's so much to be done,  
Count all the bees in the hive,  
Chase all the clouds from the sky,  
  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin,  
And Pooh.  
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do,  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose.  
  
He came to me asking help and advice,  
And from here no one knows where he goes.  
So I went in to ask of the Owl, if he's there,  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear.

The Cree and the Blackfoot lived and died  
??? the Rockies, nestled in the trees,  
I fell in love with Lake Louise  
smiling with her sparkling emerald eyes  
Soon we'll reach the sea  
and there I'll stand  
With nothing but the blue between me and japan  
Now I'm at the end of the line,  
Out of track, out of time,  
Conductor makes his final round  
All the people and places past  
They went by just a little too fast  
How I wishI could've slowed this engine down.

And close to the ground when I feel I should run  
There's a branch in my window that helps me remember  
To reach out my arms and touch the sun..

Wish for things to get better

From her back  
Carefully undid her skirt  
And let it fall unwrapped  
  
She cut with her fingers,  
The cold river sighed  
She wanted the water  
The water inside  
She walked to the center,  
Unbraided her hair  
Stepped out of her panties  
And left her breast bare  
  
Stretched out on the ice  
She dug into it slowly,  
Methodically punching  
The half frozen floor  
The blood from her fingers  
Helped warm them, but only  
Until it froze over a moment,

A flower he'd bought to her  
Bought, but forgotten to water  
  
The night rolled in slowly,  
But did not bring sleep

Inches deep  
But as she pressed her head  
  
Down to the unyielding shell

Almost well

Fearing what it'd find  
A ring of clothes around on  
Opening of the mind

Upon release, the doctors recommended a monthly  
Visit to the aviation pier,  
It does me good to see a big steel bird  
Taking off through a transparent tear  
So now I'm feeling better, less pressure on  
The laundered eye, a little less to fear.  
  
I choose a positive afternoon,  
The airport's straight ahead  
I tell myself on the way down there:  
""could this be another addiction to dread?""  
Myself replies, with a glimmer in her eyes:  
""we could always do push-ups instead"".  
  
Terminal, je t'aime, I love you terminal, bella mia.  
  
The doors guess my intentions  
And slide to let me in  
I take my steppin' slowly  
With a ritual back-side swing,  
Intercontinental jive  
Is live and tickling  
  
I gotta calm down in the lavatoire  
I look into the mirror, a maniac looks back  
Terminal's a chick like all chicks are  
I know at least a dozen girls like that  
  
She's standing there, with her short cropped hair,  
Like something suspicious aboard swissair  
A real bomb-shell,  
Her earring hook,  
The security guard gives her penetrating look.  
  
Terminal, je t'aime, I love you terminal, bella mia.  
  
I gotta find a flight, but I don't know how!  
Rome through zurich is leaving about now  
Polite pager lady telling me it's time  
Deep inside I've made up my mind  
  
Polite pager is getting uptight  
I gotta go upstairs and see my flight!  
Inside, my passion's burning bright!  
  
She's running now, she's flying high  
Taking off into the blood-red sky  
Reflected in this tearful joker's eyes  
  
Terminal, je t'aime, I love you terminal, bella mia.  
  
It's all a joke, I say to me  
Then suddenly I hear the boom!  
Explosion tears the sky apart  
A panicked flurry fills the room  
And so I turn and take a bow  
I think I'm feeling better now.

Never happy with the mirror  
She will shun all who adore  
Little one her father tells her  
Open your door  
  
The eyes of love  
Don't know your name  
Don't see the color of your skin  
The eyes of love  
Don't know where you've been  
The eyes of love  
Don't know your age  
Don't see the lines you try to hide  
The eyes of love  
See only what's inside  
  
The light shining bright from your heart

Qualcuno qualcuno dovrebbe spiegarmi chi sei veramente  
Perch? Io non lo chieder? Mai a te a te direttamente  
Perch? Io non lo chieder? Mai a te direttamente  
Come fa quel tuo sguardo a puntare il futuro  
E a fermarsi su tutte le cose  
E a passare attraverso quel mondo incantato  
E arrivare alla fine del mese  
Nessuno ancora nessuno? Riuscito a spiegarmi  
Chi sei veramente e mi sa che un bel giorno lo chieder?  
A te a te direttamente  
Un bel giorno lo chieder? A te a te direttamente  
Ma per adesso? Come stare al ristorante  
Chiedere il conto senza avere in tasca niente  
Mi hai allagato il cuore e te lo voglio dire cos?  
Tanto per fare un discorso in generale  
E tutto questo? Come stare al ristorante  
Se non hai niente da dire non dire niente  
Una di rosso e mezza naturale cosi  
Per continuare quel discorso in generale  
Come fanno le mani a resistere ancora  
E a non stringerti fino a morire  
Come fanno le parole a seguirsi intrecciarsi fino a sparire  
Come fa la tua voce a cantare la pioggia che cade  
Il vento il sereno  
La tua voce a toccare a sfumare nei colori dell'arcobaleno  
La tua voce a toccare a sfumare nella luce  
Dell'arcobaleno  
Ma tutto questo? Una questione di pazienza  
Come aspettare col sorriso una sentenza  
Come parlare del disordine mondiale cosi  
Tanto per fare un discorso in generale  
E tutto questo? Come stare al ristorante  
Se non hai niente da dire e vabb? Non dire niente  
Dimmi del mondo o leggimi il giornale

Focusing it on the sky as 99 red balloons go by

You got to get yours, but fool I gotta get mine

When you listen, to the words that I speak  
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

'Til it could fit on the head of a pin  
  
Come on in  
Did you have a hard time sleeping  
'Cause a heavy moon was keeping you awake  
And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again  
  
See my love  
Like a lost balloon  
Rising up through the afternoon  
And then you appear  
  
What did you say  
I know I saw you saying it  
My ears won't stop ringing  
Long enough to hear  
Those sweet words  
And your simple melody  
  
I just have to hear  
Your sweet words  
Spoken like a melody  
I just want to hear  
Those sweet words

The sun is gone and it's stuck in your mind  
You look to the morning with expectation  
Anticipation  
  
When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here  
You feel your spirit sing, you know there's nothing to fear  
I'm here by your side, I've got to no where to go  
So take your time, drive slow, listen to the radio  
Talk if you want, if don't just change the station  
I got patience  
  
I tell myself wait  
Wait till the sun goes down  
Wait and you'll come around  
And you'll smile for everyone  
I'll make you a place  
A place where the shadows fall  
Can be anyone or no one at all  
Just tell me what you want  
  
I know, sometimes you feel the need to beware  
I know that you scared that I care  
But I wonder who you're with when you turn out the lights  
Who do you think of at night  
  
When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here  
I've been there before and you've got nothing to fear  
I'll make you a place where the shadows fall  
And you can be anyone or no one at all  
We'll take solace from the burning sun  
Let me be there for you just this once  
  
I tell myself wait  
Wait till the sun goes down  
Wait and you'll come around  
And you'll smile for everyone  
I'll make you a place  
A place where the shadows fall  
Can be anyone or no one at all

Broke down subway in this city of spires  
Tape your picture over his in the frame  
  
We'll imagine we're sleeping revolvers  
Shotgun wedding in a strange SoHo  
Our chambers hold silvery collars  
Gun down werewolves wherever we go  
We gun down werewolves wherever we go  
  
Midnight phone calls in the back of a Mustang  
Creased white pages torn right from the spine  
Kissed my neck with a crooked, cracked fang  
You always hoped one day you'd be mine  
  
Threw our fathers on funeral pyres  
I'm not sure that we were playing a game  
Busted gasket in a field full of liars  
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame  
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame  
  
Young blood  
Young bone  
Old ghosts  
Go home  
  
Band of gold with a diamond implied  
You wrote letters that you never sent  
I made promises I'll always deny  
Now we'll never know what the other meant  
  
Watch is ticking like a heartbeat gone berserk  
Lost the chance to wind the key  
Roosters are nothing but clucking clockwork  
Our fears are only what we tell them to be  
Our fears are only what we tell them to be  
  
Drown the last of our matches  
Burn the rest of each other  
You were strongest when I ached for breath  
Through the thick of smoke we'll finally smother

Young bone  
Old ghosts  
Go home

Thought they was creepin, two trips to V-A every third weekend  
While you was sleepin, he hit you on the box  
Sixty-nine go non-stop  
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not  
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much  
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed  
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile  
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing  
Then things got frightening  
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein  
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure  
Never thought you could be a gold digger  
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga  
Asked my man Trigga, my ace boom coon  
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon  
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin In My Room  
Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunes  
Or the O-Jays, thinkin bout the old days  
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play  
Baller, did she beep you? Don't call her  
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula  
She was askin bout ya whereabouts  
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out  
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight  
You'll be all fuckin night

Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?  
I need another man, in my life

Shoulda seen the hoe, nigga pack ya shit

What about the fight in the Mirage?  
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage  
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit  
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit  
And still I, never sweat these bitches  
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures  
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete  
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat  
of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long  
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on  
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin  
Girls steady screamin, 'Kim you need to leave him!'

thinkin bout the bitches I fought

Guess you could say you's the one I trusted  
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?  
Shit got hot, you sent Feds to my spot  
Took me to court, tried to take all I got  
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her  
""Damn, why she want to stick me for my paper?""  
My Mo-sci-no ho, my Ver-sa-ce hottie  
Come to find out, you was fuckin' everybody  
You knew about me, the fake ID  
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.  
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'  
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin'  
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four  
All you heard was, ""Poppa, don't hit me no more""  
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial  
Fuck around and made her milk box material  
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips  
'Cause of you, I'm on some real fuck a bitch shit, uh  
  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
Fuck bitches, get money  
Fuck niggas, get money  
  
niggas betta grab a seat  
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep  
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet  
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite  
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down  
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound  
Now I'm Billboard now, niggas press to hit it  
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it  
Rather do the killin' than the stick up jooks  
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy  
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it  
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat  
Then, you want to be my main squeeze, nigga  
Don't cha, you want to lick between my knees, nigga  
Don't cha want to see me whippin' your three down the Ave.  
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad  
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air  
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere  
Me shifty? Now you want to pistol whip me  
Pull out your nine while I cock on mine  
Yeah, what, nigga? I ain't got time for this  
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit  
Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits  
Adia Vinadini and Chanel lime boots  
Things that make up for all the games and the lies  
Hallmark cards sayin', ""I apologize""  
Is you wit' me? How could you ever deceive me  
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me  
Naw, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow  
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know  
  
Fuck bitches, get money, fuck niggas, get money

See some nice breasts in the West  
Smoke some nice cess in the West  
Why'all niggaz is a mess  
Thinkin I'm goin stop  
Givin L.A. props  
All I got is beef with those that violate me  
I shall annihilate thee

Suitcase filled with clothes  
Linens and things  
I begin things  
People start to flash  
818s, 213s, 313s

Take her to Fatburger  
Spend about a week on Venice Beach  
Sippin Crisco  
With some freaks from Frisco

Models on the runway  
Scream biggie biggie gimme one more chance

On the celly-celly with mah homeboy lance  
Pass hash from left to right  
Only got 5 blunts left to light

Paid a visit to Versace stores  
Lets see somethin till I ain't got no more  
Only in L.A.

Lick it, say its yummy

Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit

Naw you wouldn't understand  
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack  
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back  
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet  
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me  
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone  
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on  
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?  
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone

And tell me you won't ball every chance you get

Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches

Word up  
  
Each and every day  
The daydreams of how we used to be  
See your family  
And that baby's lookin just like you  
Why'd you go away  
I've been missin you lately  
Tell me why you're gone and through  
  
[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]  
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour  
Got my man a beat down to the third power  
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour  
Got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour  
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven  
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin  
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon  
We was king till the G's crept in  
And now I'm missin em

Ooh, I'm missin you  
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns  
Ooh, I'm missin you  
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why

We work all week, we dancin, play the movies  
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies  
Made a killin, even though the D's knew me  
Eventually, you know they try to do me  
Fuck it  
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south  
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth  
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route  
Few months, he got his brain blown out  
Now I'm stressed  
His baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me  
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be  
Kinda topsy turvy  
You win some, you lose some  
Damn, they lost a brother  
They mother lost a son  
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?  
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried  
I look in the sky and ask God why  
Can't look his baby girls in the eye  
Damn I miss you

Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool  
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool  
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school  
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries  
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me  
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be  
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her  
Then she started messin with some major players  
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers  
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya  
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her  
One night, across from the corner store  
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four  
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door  
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for

Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos  
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose

Gettin paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga  
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid

I'd rather beat my dick than trick

I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck  
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck

Chilling, sitting on about half a million

It's the ten crack commandments, what?  
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke  
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas  
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas  
  
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal  
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back  
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up  
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips  
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up  
Number 4, I know you heard this before  
Never get high on your own supply  
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at  
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!  
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it  
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!  
7, this rule is so underrated  
Keep your family and business completely separated  
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch  
Find yourself in serious shit  
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!  
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too  
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,  
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police  
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen  
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'  
Number 10, a strong word called consignment  
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen  
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""  
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow  
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up  
If not, 24 years on the wake up  
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up  
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed  
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks  
She sniffed a whole half of cake up  
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up  
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

Coming to the telly, so I can bend you  
Send you to the store, condoms and more  
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores  
Could it be my hardcore metaphor  
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor  
Open up the Lex door  
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired  
I'm a roll blunts while you spin  
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving  
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin  
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se  
Much foreplay, that's my forte  
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death  
She looking for a man, honey he just left  
Violate me, he get beat to death  
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left  
Grand Marnier increase the don strength  
Two four-fifths within my arms length  
With a calm breath I say we gots to float  
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat  
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine  
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen  
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue  
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu  
Beautiful, that's how the night goes  
Get out them tight clothes  
Get in some night clothes  
I invite those girls that smoke lye  
Keep it real with you  
You keep it real with I  
We be tight like frog's ass  
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""  
  
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)  
Would you lie for me? (That's right)  
Would you get high with me? (For sure)  
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

Would you die for me? (No doubt)  
  
These hoes don't treat you like I treat you  
Like my contacts, I can see right through  
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?  
Queen Bitch means number one and two  
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me  
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one  
Y'all know where I'm from  
Bucktown, lay your ass down  
You don't wanna play around (with me)  
Probably just mad because Frank chose me  
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie  
Girls call my telephone just to hang up  
While me and you is in the crib, laying up  
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together  
And that we gonna have a kid together  
Whatever, me intimidated, never  
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim  
Anyway, I fuck better than you  
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you  
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing  
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start  
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch  
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?  
(See I don't care bout them other broads)  
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that  
  
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)  
Would you lie for me? (That's right)  
Would you get high with me? (For sure)  
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

Life without you here with me

Baby come and talk to me  
Let me know what's on your mind  
Every time I see you  
You're running from me all the time  
  
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you  
I only wanted you to be happy  
You to have the best of things  
To be down with me, baby  
'Cause your lovin', it's so good  
  
You're giving me the run-around  
Thought our love was going down  
Baby don't you know  
That I'm down until the day I die  
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you  
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you  
'Cause baby I love you  
  
Every night and day I pray  
Your love returns  
Oh I'd give my life  
If it would only make you happy

Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'  
Spittin' in faces in public places  
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months  
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front  
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda  
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said  
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that  
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted  
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran  
Ya'll stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs  
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets  
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals  
I made you - why would I play you?  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home  
  
[Chorus:]  
You to be, be happy  
You to have the best of things  
Baby everything you want it for baby  
You to be down with me  
So give me that ass back baby  
'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe  
  
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way  
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G

And to my left was a man, he had no chance  
Didn't really think about starting a scene  
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice  
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad  
Beacuse I took his money last night it's kinda funny  
But now I'm just struggling  
I need a honey-bunny.  
I don't know what to say anymore  
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...

You're something pretty and cool  
Signing records as you're passing through  
  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thieves?  
Who don't know what do  
And don't know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief?  
Who took away from you  
He took away from you  
  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on, walking on, walking on your way  
  
Behind the archway lies a thief  
Awaiting double fantasy  
He's something evil underneath  
Outside Dakota died the symphony  
  
I think everyone has a devil waiting in the wings  
When you don't know what to do  
And you don't know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief?  
Who took away from you  
Took away from you

It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed  
I know this lady whose eyes fly right through me  
And she will sit and stare directly at me.  
And that laugh will take me to my future.  
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.  
But I been working five days full time .  
Ain't got no money but everything is going fine.  
I been tired in my head.  
Said I been tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I got a lady running through my head.

Invades my mind reminds me of where we should be.  
So we just sit and we dream about our future.  
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.  
But I've been thinking five days full time.  
Ain't got no money, but everything is going fine.  
But I've been tired in my head.  
Well I am tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.

Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
My lady won't leave my head.  
I just want to rest my head to bed.  
She won't let me go.  
I don't want to go.

It's all we have  
So good so far  
  
It's not over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won  
  
Well I was thoughtless and careless  
The day I lost my innocence  
Chasing you into the sun  
  
It's okay when I'm afraid  
It's okay when I'm a fool  
Who only plays the cards he's got  
  
It's all we have  
So good so far  
  
It's not over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won  
  
So here's to tomorrow  
The next one that follows  
All and anything that comes  
  
We'll let the summer kiss the day  
Watch the rains come in  
And wash away the crazy thing we've done  
  
It's all we have  
So good so far  
All we have  
So good so far  
  
It's so good so far  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight

This ain't over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life

On the toe of it all

Under sheets of haze  
  
Somewhere down there with the crashing waves  
You kept plans for your grand escape  
And I won't see you no more  
You'll just hear me

Nothing gonna touch you when you've said goodbye

Well then he picked up and then he went down south  
Dad said nothing and mom shut her mouth  
Well, he never thought too much, just thought he could heal with his touch  
For those who need help and more love  
And when love came around I heard the sound

Building up defenses  
Making up rules by which we play

Staking our positions  
But stupid superstitions  
Only give fools too heavy a load  
  
The magpie screeched and my window is shattered  
Her body's bruised but her soul's not battered  
The fireman tried but the hose was frozen  
The cupboard's bare but the door needs closing  
  
We spend half our time away  
From being where we want to  
And seeing who it's fun to  
Not blaming ourselves for our mistakes

Just looking out of windows  
Waiting for a signal  
Waiting for night to return to day

The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching  
The meat was dead and I need me feeding  
The room was cold but the night was freezing  
  
The rainbow frowned when the sun was shining  
A baby's snatched on a beautiful morning  
A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming  
A church on fire is struck by lightning  
The dead man's hands had beautiful fingers  
The princess frowned at her lovers mistress  
She went insane and poisoned the children  
A teacher's drowned and a child is laughing

Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
They're in your way  
But as long as you're swinging  
Strong then you'll get by  
  
Your pacing's wearing out a line  
Right beside your bed  
The scene replays a million times  
Stuck inside your head  
  
And though you stand in place  
Your mind escapes  
Read between the lies  
Smile's on your face  
You fake like you're ok  
  
Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Out on your own  
They're in your way  
You may be stinging  
But you'll get by  
Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
The pain inside can guide your way  
  
Midnight, no sleep  
Inside, you scream to  
No one, hears you fall  
Daylight, prove me today  
One more try  
  
Don't turn away, don't turn  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
They're in your way  
You may be stinging  
But you'll get by  
Don? T turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
Pain inside  
Leads you through so you'll get by

I'm never gonna make it out of my hole  
But I keep on laughing  
  
Doesn't really matter  
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul  
When I was a teenager  
Suckin' booze with the Vatos  
  
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21  
They said they wouldn't make it  
They didn't make it  
We're all naked when the day is said and done  
  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Don't know who made this all come true  
But now while you're here  
You just gotta do what you gotta do  
Now if I wasn't such a weenie  
  
Do you think you'd still love me  
Pretending I'm an airplane on the living  
Room floor  
But like a lovely generator  
  
You stand right by me  
And if words were wisdom I'd be talking  
Even more  
So I keep on falling  
  
As I'm looking back above me  
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot  
Now I'm like DeNiro  
I'm amarillo  
  
And I'll never know when I hit the ground

Are turning into somebody else  
  
I know how this will end  
But I'm starting up again  
Turned around, inside out  
Cause this way  
  
Takes me nowhere I can't can't see a way out  
Takes me nowhere I can't can't see a way out  
Takes me nowhere I can't can't see a way out  
It beats me up  
  
When I go there I know I could start again  
When I go there Oh no, here we go again  
Takes me nowhere Oh no, here we go again  
It beats me up  
  
Open on this scene  
A familiar dream  
Of you telling me what I already know  
Though the truth seems near  
You can't get there from here  
But you sure know where you're gonna go  
  
As the rumor wind blows  
My infamy grows  
Seeing friends above  
And I hit another low  
The picture I paint to look at myself  
Is turning into somebody else  
  
I know how this will end  
But I'm starting up again  
Turned around, inside out  
Cause this way  
  
But today, if I change  
And stop digging my own grave  
I will try, to set things right  
Cause this way

All the memories are too few  
  
When the pastor's music plays  
And that casket rolls away  
I could live again if you  
Just stay alive for me  
  
Please stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the line  
Please stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the line  
Make it on my own  
It's the end of the line  
  
Now that you are dead and gone  
And I'm left to carry on  
I could never smile cause you  
Won't stay alive for me  
  
Finally,  
Your final resting day  
Is without me  
I weep  
And think of brighter days  
What about me?  
  
You can't take back, the one mistake  
That still lives on after life it takes  
In that one day, that changed our lives  
And bitter memories are left behind

I had a blast  
But now the morning light has come  
And kicked my ass  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
  
And by my seventh shot  
I was invincible  
I would have never thought  
I'd be this miserable  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm rolling back and forth on the bed  
I'm worked so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
  
Won't someone just kill me  
And put me out of my misery  
I'm making deals with God, I'll do anything  
Make it stop please!  
Make it stop please!  
  
I've got the worst hangover ever  
I'm crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that I'm never gonna drink again  
I'll probably never drink again  
I may not ever drink again  
At least not 'til next weekend  
I'm never gonna drink again

A disappearing star

You tear me apart  
  
When you flow through me  
Surround me and light the dark  
Brand me and leave your mark

Is breaking again  
  
We've turned the page,  
And the summer's gone  
Turning to fall  
Memories paint the pictures like dreams  
I hear you call  
Was it only a dream  
When you made love to me  
And you filled my soul  
Made me whole  
And watched me cry  
My aching heart  
  
And floating somewhere  
You're there between pain and tears  
Between my love and fear  
Where no-one hears  
And I've got nothing  
No strength left to watch you fall  
Nothing left at all

Some poor bastard bites the dust

Have a drink from an empty cup  
Light a match and burn me up.

Electric eyes that never turn off.

If it does it's for the worse, seems it's just a modern curse  
Sometimes when I take a peek outside of my little cage,  
Everyone looks so asleep, will they die before they wake  
And, hey. . . Don't you know? We're just products of our time and Hey . . .  
What d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Better dumb and happy than smart and without any friends  
Better cute and better loud, better join up with the crowd  
Keep up or be left behind, there's a dust storm in my mind  
Seems I can't see straight these days, doesn't matter anyway

Hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now. The one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change  
Do you want to change? Do you want to change right now?  
Do you want to change . . . I like my stupid life, just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs  
And I like you just the way you are, I like your face just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a herd of screaming kids  
And I like you just the way you are, I like you though you may not like me
back  
I would dazzle you with brilliance, if I only had the knack  
'Cause I like you just the way you are, I like this life just the way it is  
And the castles all around me, have been melting now for years  
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here  
All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears  
And I'm dreaming again . . . Floating in a pool of mud  
Try to get back where I was and I don't really care  
Got a little talking to, by the mirror in my room, and I don't really care . .
.  
Whispering voices from the dead, come from underneath my bed  
And I don't really care . . .  
I like my stupid life just the way it is  
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs  
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said  
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead  
And I'm dreaming again . . . and I'm dreaming again . . .  
Baby - sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes you're so far away, tell me what to do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes I just can't believe everything you do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Getting harder all the time, harder now to see  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Light another cigarette, have another dream  
It's the same thing every day, nothing ever seems to change and I . . .  
Do you really want to change?  
Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul.  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke  
Why is everyone upset? I once knew but I forget. Something happened,  
Something strange, something it appears has changed  
Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times  
And hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now, the one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change

You've got your finger in the pie  
The time has come to pick a side...

You think it's great you say it's hot  
You turn around and then it's not

But you drive a white porsche with custom tags  
You'd like to chance it but you just don't know  
Cause your getten' blind from too much snow  
I hate you but I need the deal  
Let's discuss it over a big hot meal  
Gimme a break... Gimme a break... Etc. Etc.

Think that you can hold us back? (no way)  
Don't you know we got the stuff? (sure thing)

And I'm tired of being nice (so nice)  
Can't ya look me in the eyes?  
Don't ya know I'm coming out?...  
Sorry... It's not too late... Gimme a break  
You got the job now so you call the shots  
You got the access to the bread  
You said by now that I'll be dead  
But let me tell you something friend  
Your days are numbered to the end  
You see that young cat down the hall  
He's waiten' for you to trip and fall  
You'll beg for your job down on your knees  
You'll kiss the ground and ask him please to  
Give you a break  
Give you a break

Standing in a crowded room too dark for me to see  
Someone's pushing from behind, just leave me room to breathe  
  
And go away from me, just go away  
To another time, another place  
To another world, another dream  
Go away from me...  
  
Walking down the sidewalk in a crowd that doesn't care  
Bumping into shoulders every eye is on the street  
There's a man with tattered clothes who's cursing at the air  
Everyone is slowing down to catch a little peak

Staring in the mirror like a burnt out piece of wood  
Searching every feature for a single trace of life  
Couldn't find the answer 'cause the mirror never lies

Flooded in like raging water

With someone you hardly knew  
Whereas every time you closed your eyes,  
You saw this person come alive  
It kept you wide awake at night  
You felt like you were burning up  
In pain, you want to scream  
Then you passed out in a dream

With some nagging demon tugging at that tiny bell  
Inside your mind  
When suddenly that strange idea  
Bursts into an inspiration  
You grab for it and then  
The whole thing slips right through your fingers

The fire in your eyes-- may it never go out.  
The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night.  
I see no escape from the roles we always play  
What do we have to prove on this judgement day  
You're missing the whole point-- you're not my little pet  
Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet

We shape ourselves like clay from someone else's dream.

We never even dreamed that we'd come so far

A question that

You looked like a raccoon with those circles round your eyes

I'll play until the whole damn tape runs out  
I'll put on that Ray Charles record, if you'll make some drinks

Well, so much for plans

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men  
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement  
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men  
Need to take care of their three and four kids  
But they face a court case when the child support's late  
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men  
The sleepy silent men, the punk domestic violence men  
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?

I learned to read the map before I hit the road  
  
Hey yo, I know you never heard this before  
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war  
And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it  
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor  
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed  
Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store  
Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts  
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears  
I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse  
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do  
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose  
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views

Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie  
Man of mystery, you know the history  
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here

I've been beaten and broken but I healed though  
So many ups and downs, roughed up and clowned  
We all got problems, but we deal though  
I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace  
Learn my art form, and find my inner Chi  
When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up  
Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up  
Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest  
But I realize what it takes  
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises  
But gotta make it to the next day  
It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run  
Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come  
And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'  
Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it  
  
I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em  
I've had opponents but I knocked them out  
I climbed the highest mountains  
I swum the coldest seas

I have no energy where am I now  
Too many people seem in need of me  
When I was younger I felt so free  
Can you see the things I care about  
They are not important now time has run out  
And only memories are left with me  
This shallow history becomes my destiny  
I would lie awake and cry all night  
That was then this is now

On the far horizon  
The final sunsets fall  
And tuesday becomes wednesday  
Becomes any day at all  
  
Everything we do  
Nothing remains true  
I am frightened I'm a liar  
And I'm tortured by desire  
Every single day  
In all the simple ways  
I am torn apart inside  
By the things I've tried to hide  
  
Down the dusty roads we go  
And down the leafy lanes  
And down the long and winding road  
The landscape stays the same  
  
Everything we do  
Nothing remains true

That each small sin and imperfection is buried deep beyond detection.  
But one by one the ghosts return, and each selects it's place to burn,  
Into your soft and breaking heart, and this is how the aching starts.  
The jokes about the ugly kid.  
The things you said but never did.  
The people torn and crushed and battered.  
The ones you broke but should've flattered.  
  
Oh, you should have run whilst you had time.  
Oh, you should have left the past behind.  
  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you.  
The laughing stops cause he's too near you.  
The girl you left that always loved you.  
Returns to earth from miles above you now.  
  
  
So wash away the dirty skin, there's always worse remains within.  
The tangled web and bitter mesh, but each shall have their pound of flesh.  
No sympathy, no charity, no false pleas of humility.  
No money back, no guarantee, no great escape for you and me.  
  
Oh, you should have run whilst you had time.  
Oh, you should have left the past behind.  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you.  
The laughing stops cause he's too near you.  
The girl you left that always loved you.  
Returns to earth from miles above you now.  
  
And everyone that's ever suffered, friend or foe or wives or lovers.  
They'll come back to have their day.  
In time you find your mind has no escape.  
  
  
Don't believe that you can hide, don't believe they'll be denied.  
They'll come knocking at your door, this is what they've waited for.  
The chance to even up the score.

I'm going crazy

I met a girl, I took her in up to the balcony  
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat  
She said, ""okay"" but she was worried what her friends will think  
She's going crazy  
Can't contain it

That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Well you're the charming type  
That little twinkle in your eye  
Gets me every time  
And well there must have been a time  
I was the reason for that smile  
Keep in mind  
As you take what's left of you and I  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie
