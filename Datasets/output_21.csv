Ugly Kid Joe,Busy Bee,/u/ugly+kid+joe/busy+bee_20141998.html,"Everybody's alright with me  
Possibly you'll disagree  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybody's alright with me  
That's just the way I choose to be  
Everybody's on my mind  
Can't sit aside and watch this world go by  
That ain't me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybody does their time  
The people walk in crooked lines  
Everybody's got their choice  
But often we don't use our voice  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
How could you be so blind?  
Some people they just ain't satisfied  
Watch the world go by  
  
I always hear the school bell ring  
Let the children dance and sing  
Just let us find what's been lost  
So many people get torn and tossed away  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
World go bye  
World go bye  
World go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
  
Nice ending bit  
Everybody's alright with me

Ugly Kid Joe,Dialogue,/u/ugly+kid+joe/dialogue_20142035.html,"I got no use to call you  
I got no reason to miss you at all  
I can't pretend I love you  
Although you got me by the balls  
  
I got no use  
I got no use  
  
I ain't got time to kill you  
Spend too much time behind these walls  
I can't pretend I love you  
Although you got me by the balls  
  
You weave your web around me  
And all your eyes confuse me  
You drain my balls beneath me  
And then you try to eat me

But that don't change the way I feel about you,  
If you think all this might be bringing me down,  
Look again cause I ain't wearin' no frown!  
  
I don't really care about your sister  
Forget the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her  
One thing that I did to your lady  
Put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe  
I know you know everybody knows  
The way it comes, the way it goes  
You think it's sad well that's too bad  
'Cause I'm havin' a ball and never cared a thing about  
You  
  
Everything about you, everything about you  
I get sick when I'm around

I hate everything about you

So I stepped out to the clouds  
The Holy Father was getting down  
And as I ordered a round of drinks  
He said I got a little story tell me what you think  
Moses used to sniff the lines  
Noah used to rock the boat sometimes  
Mary used to get undone  
Jesus rode a Harley Davidson  
All the angels were gathered around  
Leather boots and lace night gowns  
And one started to kiss my feet  
She said the Lord got a red light on at every street  
My superstars were laced up tight  
And all the sinners were gathered in white  
The pearly gates were opened up wide  
And the Lord must have seen me with his big red eyes

About the way he gets the crowd to move  
And groove and dance to the things he do  
And prove the way he sway and lift and shape  
And rock hard, all night he's on and on  
Swiftly slicing, cuts are nice and smooth like rice and  
Beans, another cut rises  
Moe surprises more than one

Quizzical glances behind cigarette smoke  
She drew the curtains at the end of the day  
And then we laughed because the room sailed away  
Fancy glitter in the summer arcades  
Then autumn leaves fall by a winter lane  
Piano echoes and the perfume still lingers  
But you fell through my fingers like sand  
With a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times with a distant smile

The city's glittering like diamonds in heat  
Our secret destination, touch down in the haze  
As the cameraman pans away  
Hey look, it's a long lost horizon  
Private oceans you can surface a sunrise in  
Hearts well ? dodging logic  
But nevertheless still permanently surprised  
Behind a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times behind a distant smile

Ultravox,Dreams?,/u/ultravox/dreams_20834922.html,"When I was a boy, there's a dream that I had  
That a war if it's fought was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find that the world had gone mad  
And we'd all fall down  
And I feel like a child again sitting observing  
You're toying with power, your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard that the worms won't be turning  
We'll all fall down  
While you try to pretend you're a God upon high  
With your party ideals and your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch you're not smarter than I  
And we'll all fall down  
If it's color or creed, or your old time religion  
Well, fighting for that shows a pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive is the fight to survive  
And we'll all fall down  
Well, look in the mirror and what do you see  
An American, Russian, a soldier or me?  
When you've all pressed the buttons  
Just where will you be when we all fall down?  
It gets harder to see just what future's in store for us  
Hard to see through all the wool you pull over us  
Words that you give are just words to console us  
We'll all fall down  
And what will you do when you've pulled the release  
When the sound of the thunder has drowned out the pleas  
'Cos after all that was your idea of peace  
When we all fall down  
No sun for a world that once stood so tall  
No wind's going to blow and no rain's going to fall  
No flowers for graves, in fact no graves at all  
When we all fall down

Riding inter-city trains  
Dressed in European grey  
Riding out to echo beach  
A million memories in the trees and sands, oh no  
How can I ever let them go?

Where only echoes penetrate  
Walk through Polaroids of the past  
Futures fused like shattered glass, the suns so low  
Turns our silhouettes to gold

Hands through a wire,  
Forbidden desires,  
Are mine for life.  
  
Looking from a spiral staircase,  
At a man with a suitcase,  
As he shades his eyes.  
Watching from a stained glass shelter,  
He bides his time and thinks,  
There must be more to life than this.

The poet reads his words out loud,  
To a make-believe crowd,  
In the quiet of his room.  
Careful where the tears are falling,  
He closed the book and cried,  
There must be more to love than this.  
See the boy on the walkway  
Where the young have their own say,  
And it screams from the wall.  
He's writing for the hundredth time there,  
I hate it all but,  
There must be more to hate than this.

It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,  
Judging by the style.  
He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane,  
Perhaps he died in a car crash, years ago.  
Right now, it's impossible to tell.  
I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge.  
I asked him the time, but when he turned around,  
I saw it wasn't him at all.  
I'm still searching.  
I'm still searching.  
I saw him in an airport, while he was sitting on a wing.  
And I waved to him, but I don't think he noticed me.  
I've got a funny feeling I know who he is.

Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away.  
  
Take what you can  
They said take it while you may.  
But keep in mind penalty fits the crime  
  
And it deals no softened blow.

Those thin and cherished words  
A willing victim for the kill again

And your heart still full of doubt  
It's just like you to scorn  
The only one who'll mourn  
The day he doesn't love you

When the time comes I'll cry  
On the day you cut the thread  
When my heart tears I'll cry  
So you gave up giving  
And you sit and smile  
When the awkward silence falls  
Deny the life you're living  
Just a fleeting love  
That you only half recall  
It's just like you to make  
A passion turned to hate  
The day he doesn't love you

Still we're here together  
Feeling helpless as our heaven turns to hell  
The taker and the giver  
Washed in anger

The step than makes the break  
The day he doesn't love you

She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
She don't care what the game is  
She's always down to play  
My world without her  
Seems a million miles away  
She don't have to worry  
I know where I belong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
I've been dealt some aces  
And I've played them all the same  
But she's the only one  
That keeps me in the game  
No fame or fortune  
Could ever keep me gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me  
It's a wonder she's not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
There's a magic down in Memphis  
That never seems to fade  
Even now them voices carry  
Like a lonely serenade  
It's the memories that still  
And always will be on my mind  
They move me every time.  
  
She sees the good  
In everything there is to see  
Sometimes I wonder  
What she ever sees in me  
I'm not always right you know  
But she's never led me wrong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
In all my travels  
I've never found a way  
To find the words that say  
The things I'd like to say  
I've sang some melodies  
But she's my favorite one  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
She's the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones who've left me

She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song.

I hate to break the news, but I got a broken heart.  
That sweet southern belle, that I met in Tennessee  
Got a hickey on her neck and it ain't from me.  
Seems there's someone special she's been meeting at the gym,  
but the crazy thing about it, is that someone's not a him.

My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.  
It was cool for a minute, now its bringing me down.  
People talkin' bout it all over this town.  
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.  
  
All my friends say, she's just going through a phase  
and I believed her when she said I just need a little space  
But then I found pictures on her cellular phone,  
of them doing things, when I wasn't home  
It hit me like a brick, I guess I should have seen the signs  
This was more than just a friend and a bottle of wine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah mom and dad, really nothing left to say  
I'll be sure to keep you posted if she swing it back this way  
I guess I'm not as sad as you think I might be  
The part that makes me mad is that they didn't invite me.

I'll come runnin' when you call my name  
'cause I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame  
I said I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame  
  
I might stagger and I might sway  
I might stutter just a bit but that's OK  
I'm not walkin' too good that's true  
I got a broke ass limp that'll pull me though  
I might appear to be a pile of rags  
But I'm a stack of hundreds in a paper bag  
I've been around this world and back  
I made a million bucks and put it all on black  
  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because

I've been known to wake up in some dirty places  
The sun only shines on deserving faces  
The mind erases, forgets the stars  
See each and every city has corner bar  
That's where I am in a world so grim  
The lights are as bright as the day is dim  
See I'm priceless in a class of my own  
I used to stay out late but now I don't go home  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
How do you feel when the birds are chirpin'  
When your in bed and everybody is workin'  
Are you down with the non believers  
Make the slackers look like over achievers  
The dogs scratchin' on the door again  
The cat's out but he don't want to come in  
You got a bed and you got a floor  
But the couch is closer to your front door  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because

What is romance if it is all fiction?

Breathe taking the closest thing to me and my savior  
Falling in love to a person I have never met but knowing she has salvation's
fragrance  
By God's grace this love will be free and able to fly away above  
The earth to a point of exhaustion  
But your breath will keep me alive  
Words are pointless for this love is speechless  
Preparing fro the curtains close  
Laying their clutching hands so tight I can feel your heart  
Telling me it will be all right  
Ascension to heaven wehre this love can not only walk  
But it runs through the endless fields of joy  
Where love neither ends nor begins but flows everlasting  
This was thy dream this daybreak and will by thy prayer  
That I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day  
And butterflies sing with us as we write love symphony  
The pages of life fill the story of our love in a time long ago  
Where fairy tales come true  
And you and I, my love, will live happily ever after

Here's my kiss to betray  
Desperate to brush the lips of grace  
Do you feel hollow when you think of how Iv lied?  
  
Oh sweet angel of mercy  
With your grace like the morning  
Wrap your loving arms around me  
  
Hey unfaithful I will teach you to be stronger  
Hey ungraceful I will teach you to forgive one another  
Hey unloving I will love you

I had faith you flew past the sky  
Straight through the night  
And the sun reflects the night  
Carrying the very same thing  
In your heart that saved me  
But maybe you've stopped listening  
Falling on my selfish ways  
It takes faith to see

Instead of hiding until I lost faith  
A heart gets broken as a life gets set free  
And all I asked was love me  
Years passed, seasons changed and I waited  
(Hate time to say goodbye, hate time)  
Soon after was the pain  
That would never reach you  
You've gotten over me  
But it seems I'll never get over you

Dreams or you changing your mind  
Anything to pass the time

Across the human race  
There's a truth that draws  
A tear upon your face  
A child is crying and it echoes  
All over the world  
If we try to find some  
Deep communication  
Bring an end to war  
And start a new creation  
From the truth inside  
It's waiting, it's waiting  
Suddenly then  
The clearest voice will call  
Feeling the air  
You have no choice at all  
Can I ask the question to you  
Do you know who you are  
Do you know what we're doing here  
Try to see the way from within  
'Cause it isn't outside  
Let your honesty see it clear  
Why does anger fit our hearts  
With missconception  
Turn us inside out in every direction  
From the truth inside  
That's waiting, it's waiting  
Follow the voice  
That lives inside your heart  
Never the choice  
That tears your world apart  
Take a walk and be  
A wave upon the oceanTouch the sky and  
Feel our spirit in motion  
This is the love inside that's waiting  
Just waiting  
Suddenly everything is there to see  
You can be everything you want to be  
Are you ready to go my love  
Are you ready to be my love  
Are you ready to die for love

Some were dancing

Shone brightly overhead  
  
The stars so gaily glistened  
And the sphinx in silence listened to  
The magician tell of  
Lives that he had led  
  
Let the bells of freedom ring  
Songs of love to Friday's king  
  
Let's all go to  
The magician's birthday  
It's in a forest  
But not so far away  
Much to do  
And so much to say  
While we listened to  
The orchid orchestra play  
  
Happy Birthay to you  
Happy Birthday to magician  
Happy Birthday to you  
  
Then at the dead of midnight  
As we watched the dancing firelight  
The air grew cold  
And seemed to dull the flame  
The fire died  
The music faded  
Filled with fear of death we waited  
For now we knew  
Some evil was to blame  
  
I challenge you  
I challenge you all  
For all you own  
And all you know  
And by all the powers of darkness  
I will steal what is mine  
  
Surrender now or face my spite  
I grant you it may be Friday night  
But did you know this day  
Also numbers thirteen  
  
First I'll give you fire  
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream  
Yes, now I give you nightmares  
From your horror I'll create a dream  
  
You cannot fight me  
For I have the sword of hate  
But one thing you can't see  
My answer is simply  
An impenetrable fortress  
Of love, love, love  
  
The fear went as quickly as it came  
The air was clear  
The fire burned again  
The flames leapt  
The organ played  
The swans sang  
To greet the day

Love will find love will find love

Long as I know that you're here with me baby  
Shedding all your innocence  
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate  
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways  
But I promise girl I ain't afraid  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that  
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive  
  
Can't help it, no  
I want you to feel me  
Every little bit of me baby  
I don't need a life saver  
Baby going deeper ain't gon' kill me  
And I know the rest you'll get from me  
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate  
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways  
But I promise girl I ain't afraid  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that  
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive  
  
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby  
You'll be my place to hide all night, all night babe  
I'm not afraid to try  
And no I don't mind playing in the rain  
And I was hoping that I'd get to take that dive  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that

I told my man I'm having a barbecue  
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through  
He brought this shorty that I used to know  
It brought me back to when I was in school  
  
She said usher where have you been?  
We used to kick it every now and then  
Remember when I used to call your phone  
Tell you come on cause my mother's gone  
  
How about them times I had to throw  
A rock at your window  
To let you know to come downstairs  
And open the door  
  
And after that baby it was on for sure  
  
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real  
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel  
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this, huh  
But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to reminisce, cause

Now she's asking me to take her  
On a tour of my house so we can catch up  
For all the time lost since I blew up  
And became the man that drops his pants  
And every girl around the world is dying to love  
  
Break the beat down  
Let me tell you what I'm talking about  
If you're not careful it'll turn you out  
It's that way she used to go  
  
When you want it nice and slow  
Even though you can't  
The memory will make you want some mo'  
She used to understand me  
  
Touch me, hold me, taught me how to be a man  
She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me  
Damn I wish that I could do it again  
  
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real  
Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel  
But I got a girl now and yo she's right upstairs

Never had somebody that's as bad  
Somebody with a whole lot of body  
That'll choose, make you want to leave the one you with  
'Cause you know how good it is  
  
Not a prissy, lil' missy baby, talk that slang  
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thang  
She was a friend of the fam  
Hot without the glam, not  
  
When I be trippin'  
She didn't really give a damn, stop  
It's what I need to do  
'Cause I know what's this is leading to  
If I keep on thinkin' bout that back

When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous  
She speaks with her body, so united  
In the language that I will never forget  
  
I hear her calling  
Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me  
And when she started moving closer and closer  
Does she know that i want her, I want her  
I wanna be with her tonight  
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips  
In my life, I've never felt like this  
I've never had a lost for words  
One kiss from her has got me feenin'

Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her  
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out  
Used to care, she used to share  
The love that she used to give me can't be found  
I lost my way, she said she'd stay  
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost  
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold  
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us  
And that was before the hurricane came, came in and stopped us  
I told you to leave, but you lied to me  
When you said that, ""baby no worries I promise to get us back"".

We rarely even ever say a word  
I really want to give her everything she deserves  
But the bad took away the good  
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired  
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying  
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say  
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it  
I should take it like a man and walk up out it  
Cause we will never be the same, oh  
I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame

He'll never understand  
The chemistry between me and you-Ah baby  
You can try to stop it but it won't quit  
You say you don't when I know that you want it  
I know,one day you'll be mine  
  
One day you'll be mine[mine]  
No more creepin', sleepin' around  
No whisperin' when he's around  
One day you'll be mine

Call her up at her home, she won?t know that I'm on the phone

Homie we about to bust this trick  
Man just ask her to meet up with you and I'm gonna show up too  
And then she won't know what to do  
We'll be standing there singing

See she was taken flights going back and forth  
I would pick her up at the Airport  
Man I really can't believe the

'Cause love isn't for me and you  
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win  
'Cause we could never act out our parts  
If love is the bible, then we are lost in sin  
Cause it's not in our hearts  
  
So why don't you go your way  
And I'll go mine  
Live your life  
And I'll live mine  
Baby you'll do well  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off separated  
  
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark  
Love never felt so cold  
If love was the light, then we're lost in the dark  
Left with no one to hold  
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team  
You and i are destined to lose  
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream  
'Cause love isn't for me and you  
  
Why don't you go your way  
And I'll go mine  
Live your life  
And I'll live mine

It's sad but now, we gotta say goodbye  
Girl you know I love you, I can't deny  
Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I  
I know it hurts, so much but it's best for us  
Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust  
So I'll walk away, so you don't have to see me cry  
It's killing me so, why don't you go  
  
Why don't you go your way (oh)

Telling you can't control what you can't have  
You're here, to enjoy yourself  
But time, in the back of your mind  
Spinning what's left of it on the floor  
Have another round and just enjoy this party  
Put your fear aside, go head and grab somebody  
Ain't no limit, no such thing is too much  
And if you cause a line in the V-I  
I'm waiting on you to show me

When time is all she wanted all along

Why do you make something so easy so complicated  
Searching for what's right in front of your face  
But you can't see it  
  
So you think that you know what's important  
Steady chasin' your fame and your fortune  
But you don't know  
You're chasing a dime losin' a treasure  
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all  
Ooh, it goes  
  
You give her spending money  
Duh da duh da  
But all she want to spend is time alone (tonight)  
Keep givin' her  
The finer things but  
But she don't really need that  
If you don't stop you're  
You're gonna end up alone (alone)

That everything I feel, has got to be real

You're everything I wanted before I knew just what I wanted  
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside  
You're the only one I want I can't deny

I'm not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way, do I take your hand or let go  
Do I take your hand or let it go  
I can't take this feeling much more

It's your kiss it's your touch it's just everything  
But I'm feeling like I want to just run away  
Can't tell you what I want, but your'e everything I want  
And hey, hey it's killing me on the inside  
Cause you're all I ever wanted so I can't deny

Somebody tell me  
Oh, is it that I'm so wrong, I can't say

2000 it's us  
Yo, it's time to u-turn  
Ya heard me?  
You're either with us, or against us, yo  
  
It's been some years now  
Since we hit the floor to get down  
We always had a step to go with the sound  
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball  
Remember, the snake  
And how the floor used to clear  
And everybody would break  
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it  
We're bringing it all back  
This is how we do it, just  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Put your hands up, bend your knees  
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me  
Oh come on, come on  
It's not hard to learn  
Come on, come on  
It's called the u-turn  
  
In the 80s, fresh was the talk  
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk  
In the 90s, I had a high flat top  
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok  
I can't forget about my high school days  
The sound was Bobby Brown  
The dance was the running man  
Now everybody want to push Bentley's  
The year is two, everybody do the u-turn  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
All you need to do is let go  
Let the tempo take over you  
I came to have a good time  
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul  
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa

She's a bad little actress

Her mascara ran  
And the show was panned

When the curtain falls  
There's no one at the backstage door

Back to the fields and forests  
Now I am one of them  
""Turn on the power"" cried the army of sound  
And the hum of the amps shook the trees and the ground  
And like a single man we cranked up the knobs  
And a thousand guitars sang our national anthem  
We captured the whole human race  
There was nowhere to hide, playing filled every space  
Jamming the world back into place  
Everyone a star  
We hit the supreme overload  
And the great amplifier began to explode  
The smoke is slowly clearing away  
And the whole universe is a giant guitar

Tell me what's in a name?  
She made me drunk with her charms

I split the scene like a shot in the dark  
  
Ain't got no target, don't aim for no mark  
'Cause I'm off like a shot in the dark  
It was only a game when we first started  
The novelty wore away and the fun departed  
  
I can't live up anymore to those things I spouted  
And if you say you feel the same way  
I'll be off like a  
Shot in the dark  
  
There's no changes going down  
There's no lesson to be found  
Makes no sense to hang around  
If that's all there is to that

And you say you've had enough  
The mysterious mad man with his hand on the lever  
Don't seem to never ever want to let you off  
You can't get off this wheel of karma  
You can't stop the hands of time  
Now I have a friend, I might have a few

You might say we've got a problem there  
You know we all got this habit  
We like to talk too much  
And that always tends to slow you down  
But we never change direction  
We just keep going round and round and round and round  
And let me off this wheel of karma  
Let me stop the hands of time  
Seems like I've been around so many places  
And I must have learned a lot of things  
And although I ain't yet come up with a so-called answer  
At least I think I finally learned how to sing

The web of life connects each of us to the other  
So it's no use pretending that you alone run the show  
Just like a moth too close to the fire explodes  
Though the myth is exposed  
You're still looking for windows in the sky

All you need is a miracle divine  
All that's left is you alone

Kick us out of the party and bust us to parole

Come on take me down, down,  
Down...  
I'm in a cold sweat  
Lord don't let me drown, drown,  
Drown, drown  
In mother earth's soul, yet  
Under darken skies  
We'll see the light  
Broken now I can't help but feel  
Someone cracked the seventh seal  
Nothing sacred, nothing left  
Unturned  
When nothing's simple  
Then nothing's learned  
So take me down to the virgin spring  
Wash away my suffering, oh  
Splash that holy water on me  
Wash my eyes so I can see  
Come on take me down, down, down...  
I'm in a cold sweat  
Yeah, don't let me drown, drown,  
Drown, drown  
In mother earth's soul, not yet

And they didn't even stop the show.  
They don't remember the place, but they remember the face,  
And now everybody want to go.

He's got the look. Top Jimmy, he's the king.

Jimmy on the news at five.

That baddest cat alive.  
Driving all the women crazy, only want Jimmy-baby,  
Love it when he rolls his eyes.

Well I'm takin' some time on my own.  
Well I'm makin' some plans for my getaway  
There'll be blue skies shining up above  
When I'm cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Well I've got to get out of the rat-race now  
I'm tired of the ways of mice and men  
And the empires all turning into rust again.  
Out of everything nothing remains the same  
That's why I'm cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Sittin' up on the mountain-top in my solitude  
Where the morning fog comes rollin' in  
Just might do me some good.  
  
Well I'm waiting in the clearing with my motor on  
Well it's time to get back to the town again  
Where the air is sweet and fresh in the countryside  
Well it won't be long before I get back here again.

No pain and no gain it s driving me insane  
  
I d like to be somewhere else  
Like to be all by myself  
Like to be down at the beach  
Relaxing at the sugar shack  
Hot dogs coffee black  
Coca cola kicking back  
  
I'm just a wild and crazy guy  
But I m tearing at the seams  
Before you can say Jack Robinson  
I'll be seeing you in my dreams  
She's on a blanket with a book  
In the shade, white suit  
  
Happy hour at the bar  
And I m jamming with some friends  
We're up to the same tricks  
Drinking cocktails getting our kicks  
Later on by the pool  
Looking good ah, be cool  
  
There's no craic double back  
Moving on down the track  
Moving on down the line  
Got to chill out in style  
Got to ease my troubled mind  
Thinking just might be a crime  
  
All work and no play  
Makes Jack a dull chap  
When it comes to the crunch  
It's too much I've got to stop  
No pain no gain it's all going

Van Morrison,Ancient Highway,/v/van+morrison/ancient+highway_20142993.html,"There's a small cafe on the outskirts of town  
I'll be there when the sun goes down  
Where the roadside bends  
And it twists and turns  
Every new generation  
And I'll be praying to my higher self  
Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground  
  
There's a roadside jam playin' on the edge of town  
In a town called Paradise near the ancient highway  
When the train whistle blows  
All the sadness that Hank Williams knows  
And the river flows  
Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns  
In a factory in a street called Bread in East Belfast  
Where Georgie knows best  
What it's like to be Daniel in the lion's den  
Got so many friends only most of the time  
  
When the grass is high and the rabbit runs  
Though it's talkin' to you and I  
And every new generation comes to pay  
The dues of the organ grinder jam  
And the grinder's switch of the sacrifice  
Everybody made to be rational with understanding  
And I'll be praying to my higher self  
Oh, don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground  
  
What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt  
That won't go away no matter how hard they try  
They've got to pay time and time again, time and time again

And I'll be standin' there, where the boats go by

You'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again  
By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes  
Have to slip away in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the hill, with a sense of wonder  
Everything gonna be right on a Friday evening  
All the cars go by all along down  
The ancient highway  
And I'll be praying, I'll be praying to my higher self  
Don't let me down, keep my feet, keep my feet on the ground  
Keep my feet on the ground  
  
Traveling like a stranger in the night, all along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sights, got you on my mind  
I'll be praying in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the mountain, got to get you right in my sight  
As the beams on the cars from the overpass  
On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night  
Like diamonds in the night  
I'll be praying to my higher self, to my higher self  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
  
And you'll be standing there, while the boats go by  
While the boats go by on a Friday evening  
Shining your light, shining your light on a Friday evening  
Got to slip away, got to slip away down that ancient highway  
In a town called Paradise, in a town, in a town  
All along, all along that road, all along that road,  
All along that road with the trance like vision  
  
I'll be praying to my higher self, don't let me down, don't let me down  
Keep my feet on the ground, keep my feet on the ground,  
Keep my feet on the ground

Watching the view from a car from the overpass  
And we're driving down that ancient road  
Shining like diamonds in the night, oh diamonds in the night  
All along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sight, got you in my mind  
Got you in my arms and I'm praying, and I'm gonna pray  
I'm gonna pray, to my higher self, ah don't let me down  
Don't let me down, give me the fire, ah give me the fire

With a silver half a crown  
  
Hands are full of a fishin' rod  
And the tackle on our backs  
We just stood there gettin' wet  
With our backs against the fence  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul  
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll  
And it stoned me  
And it stoned me to my soul  
Stoned me just like goin' home  
And it stoned me  
  
Then the rain let up and the sun came up  
And we were gettin' dry  
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by  
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned  
  
And he dropped us up the road  
We looked at the swim and we jumped right in  
Not to mention fishing poles  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Let it run all over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the way back home we sang a song  
But our throats were getting dry  
Then we saw the man from across the road  
With the sunshine in his eyes  
  
Well he lived all alone in his own little home  
With a great big gallon jar  
There were bottles too, one for me and you  
And he said Hey! There you are  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Get it myself from the mountain stream

The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow  
That we had to bear  
  
While the one I was tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
How can they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
Well, we have each other now  
That's all that matters anyhow  
While the judgment  
Of gossips never fair  
  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then someday they'll see they're wrong  
So, let them call our love  
A back street affair  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for  
Then we'll share  
  
And I'll climb a mountain high  
And the world will hear me cry  
That our love is not  
A backstreet affair

And all the dogs are barkin'  
Way on down the diamond-studded highway where you wander  
And you roam from your retreat and view

Every scrapbook stuck will glue

Way across the country where the hillside mountain glide  
The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander  
Past your window with a lantern lit  
You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze  
Said your time was open, go well on your merry way  
Past the brazen footsteps of the silence easy  
You breathe in you breathe out you breathe in you breathe out you breath in  
You breathe out you breathe in you breathe out

Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you

A brand new day oh  
  
I was lost and double crossed  
With my hands behind my back  
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt  
Shoved out on the railroad track  
I've been used, abused and so confused  
And I had nowhere to run  
But I stood and looked  
And my eyes got hooked  
On that beautiful morning sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the sun shines down all on the ground  
Yeah and the grass is oh so green  
And my heart is still and I've got the will  
And I don't really feel so mean  
Here it comes, here it comes  
0 here it comes right now  
And it comes right in on time  
Well it eases me and it pleases me  
And it satisfies my mind

On the street where I was born  
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee,  
Muddy Waters singin' ""I'm A Rolling Stone""  
I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys' book on Zen

Drove through Shrigley taking pictures  
And on to Killyleagh  
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the Lecale District,  
Just before Coney Island  
  
On and on, over the hill to Ardglass  
In the jam jar, autumn sunshine, magnificent  
And all shining through  
  
Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of  
Mussels and some potted herrings in case  
We get famished before dinner  
  
On and on, over the hill and the craic is good  
Heading towards Coney Island

Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine

Yes all will come play the pipes and drum  
Sing a happy song and we'll sing along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We shall walk again down along the lane  
Down the avenue just like we used to do  
With our heads so high smile at the passers by  
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Ain't nobody gonna give you a helping hand

And just go into the sound  
When you hear that fast train  
  
And you keep moving on to the sound of the wheels  
And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels  
And you start breaking down and go into the pain  
Keep on moving on a fast train  
  
You're way over the line next thing you're out of your mind  
And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept

Oh trying to get away from the past  
Oh keep on moving keep on moving on a fast train

Van Morrison,For Mr. Thomas,/v/van+morrison/for+mr+thomas_10169450.html,"From faded newsprint used to wrap a fish  
Inscrutably the muse selects your face  
As I sit drinking famously in an Irish bar  
Five thousand miles and thirty years away  
  
With the usual ceremonial you were crowned one night  
King of the field where doctors nail the cows  
To make of the cock's quill the rights of language  
And the pricking heart a sword against the hours  
  
Let smirking scholars writhe in their favorite bondage  
And hold you plaintiff to the charge of art  
Exhibit A: he falls on legendary lines  
Singing mother I don't want a pain here in my heart  
  
The judge in me sucks eggs and jerks the sacred meat  
But the boy in me still dreams in Milk Wood town  
Like two provincial bastards playing the galleries  
I hold your photo to a mirror upside down  
  
And as bacon wafts through hungry streets, your ghost pervades  
Just like an old ex-boxer aged twenty two  
Staged-up like Falstaff or the wild welsh Rimbaud  
You'd laugh to see the monograms they make of you  
Ah, Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight fair  
Let us throw old bottles at the Ferris wheel  
Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight  
Let us steal whatever we are supposed to steal  
  
Let us watch while the days grow daily more mundane  
That rough God go riding with his shears  
Hack wide the belly of the swollen mountains  
And rip molten heroes forth from their furious tears

Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal

From the loneliness of the crowd

They were giving you religion  
Breaking bread and drinking wine

You were carrying your defects  
Sleeping on a pallet on the floor

Stopped for a bottle of beer  
Said to the old bartender man  
Has my lover Johnny man been here?  
  
He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.  
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door  
And then to her great surprise  
There sat her lover man Johnny  
  
Makin' love to Nellie Bly  
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44  
  
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him

To see what's the matter with her boy

Here what she said:

'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.

She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell  
  
She would be there moanin', herself  
With no one there to care  
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong  
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long  
  
You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey  
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)  
And they ain't never coming back

In this God forsaken place  
When my confidence was well, then I tripped and I felt  
Right flat on my face  
Now I'm standing erect, and I feel like coming back  
And the sun is shining gold  
Put a smile on my face, get back in the human race  
And get on with the show  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
In the wee midnight hour I was parking my car  
In this dimly lit town,  
I was attacked by two thugs, who took me for a mug  
And shoved me down on the ground  
And they pulled out a knife, and I fought my way up  
As they scarpered from the scene  
Well this is no New York street, and there's no Bobby on the beat  
And things ain't just what they seem  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
Who would think this could happen in a city like this  
Among Blake's green and pleasant hills,  
And we must remember as we go through September  
Among these dark satanic mills  
If there's such a thing as justice I could take them out and flog them  
In the nearest green field  
And it might be a lesson to the bleeders of the system  
In this whole society  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending like it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day, golden autumn day ...

Breathe it in all the way down  
To your stomach too  
And breathe it out with a radiance  
Into the night time air

Van Morrison,High Summer,/v/van+morrison/high+summer_20142947.html,"By the mansion on the hillside  
Red sports car comes driving down the road  
And pulls up into the driveway  
And a story does unfold  
  
She's standing by the rhododendrons  
Where the roses are in bloom  
Looking out at the Atlantic ocean  
And in her head she hums this tune  
  
Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again  
'cause high summer has got me down  
I'll wait till the end of August  
And get off this merry-go-round  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
She took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground  
  
He's a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him, nothing will shake him  
'cause high summer has got him low down  
  
High summer's got him lonesome  
Even when he makes the rounds  
There's been no two ways about it  
High summer's got him low down  
  
Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside  
Settled down to start a new  
Far away from the politicians  
And the many chosen few  
  
Far away from the jealousy factor  
And everything that was tearing him apart  
Far away from the organ grinder  
And everyone that played their part  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
'Cause he took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him to the ground  
  
He's a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him nothings shaken  
'cause high summer's got him low down  
  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him low down  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him down, low down  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him low down  
Low down

Van Morrison,How Can A Poor Boy,/v/van+morrison/how+can+a+poor+boy_20830573.html,"Had my congregation, had my flock  
When I was a shepherd of men  
Chased the wild goose, chased the pot of gold  
Chased the rainbows end  
  
How can a poor boy deliver this message to you?  
How can a poor boy? You don't believe anything that's true  
  
Had my rise, had my downfall  
Now I'm gonna rise up again  
Had my degrees, my initiations  
Not speaking to the profane  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true?  
  
I've been anointed, been appointed  
Even been magnified  
Spied a chapel all of gold  
The priest was laying down with the swine  
  
How can a poor boy get a little message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe anything is true?  
How can a poor boy get this message through to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a single thing is true?  
  
Watch the illusion of false security  
Play of the shadows that move  
Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men  
Only the shadow knows  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true, for you  
When you don't believe a thing, nothing that's true for you  
How can a poor boy ever get next to you?

Has a life, has a spirit, has a name  
  
You think the only people who are people  
Are the people who look and think like you  
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger  
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew  
  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?  
  
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest  
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth  
Come roll in all the riches all around you  
And for once, never wonder what they're worth  
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers  
The heron and the otter are my friends  
And we are all connected to each other,  
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends  
  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
  
How high does the sycamore grow?  
If you cut it down, then you'll never know  
  
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
For whether we are white or copper-skinned  
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

All you'll own is earth until  
You can paint with all the colors of the wind

And call the angels down to the earth

Vanessa Williams,Long Way Home,/v/vanessa+williams/long+way+home_20143519.html,"It's hard to say from where you stand  
Exactly when it all began  
But someplace there's a point you cross the line  
You see the tears than stain your face  
Mirrored in your make-up case  
And know it's time to leave this place behind  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
Trying to retrace your steps  
It's all too easy to forget  
Just which way to go  
It's a long way home  
  
Outside the sky is threatening  
You slowly gather up your things  
And wonder how you ever will explain  
Walking out so self-assured  
Yeah, you were gonna change the world  
Walking back, a child in the rain  
  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
How can you retrace the steps  
You've been trying to forget  
Still it's time to go  
And it's a long way home  
  
And if you lose your way  
Just keep your eye upon that endless broken line  
  
Throw your bag beneath the bus  
Sit among the curious  
It happens to the best of us, you know  
  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
It's a long way home  
Starting to retrace your steps  
You learn to live with your regrets  
Next stop heaven knows  
It's a long way home  
Such a long way  
It's a long way home

The way I feel for you I know I'll never feel again  
Memories of loving you still linger in my head

To howl at the moon the whole night through.  
And they really don't care if I do

For in time we may have a love's glory  
Our love story to tell  
Just as every autumn leaves fall from the tree  
Tumble to the ground and die  
So in the springtime like sweet memories  
They will return as will I  
Like the sun dear, upon high  
We'll return dear, to the sky  
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow  
Until tomorrow, goodbye  
One more kiss dear, one more sigh  
Only this dear, is goodbye  
For our love is such passion, such pleasure  
I will treasure until till I die  
Like the sun dear, upon high  
We'll return dear, to the sky  
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow  
Until tomorrow, goodbye

How we chased a million stars  
and touched as only one can  
Once, we did play  
How the past delivered you  
Amidst our youth we'd dream away, away  
As if I knew the words I'm sure you'll hear  
Of how we met as you recall so well  
Once, we did love  
Long ago how did I forget  
Holding you so closely  
Look, how I move  
Chance would have me glance at you  
To know how you move me, me  
All barriers fall around us as we hear  
Of memories known and matters long ago, so clear

Once, we did run  
How we chased a million stars  
And touched as only one can

We are allways three ... counting my shadow and my friend the shimmering moon  
Happily the moon knows nothing of drinking, and my shadow is never thirsty  
When I sing, the moon listens to me in silence. When I dance, my shadow dances
too.  
After all festivities the guests must depart. This sadness I do not know.  
When I go home, the moon goes with me and my shadow follows me""

Self destruction can always be true  
Islands of fire keep me alive  
No drugs around can fill me inside

But you'll pay the price if you're not playin' it by the game  
'cause this game is made up of a bunch of crazy rules  
And fools get took if they're not playing by the rules  
Now, the Ice is kickin' it, kickin' it kickin' it like a champ  
But don't try to play me like some wet food stamp  
They say that it was a fluke  
'cause I used a fat loop  
But here's the sccop, troop  
The Ice is back to make it hoop  
An' since it's 94, and now I'm back on the scene  
Escapin from the hell of takin' it to the extreme  
It's kind of strange, 'cause people say you've changed..  
But I never changed  
Even though I got Fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 2]  
Fame, I'm still the same person  
I never ever switch, an' even if I'm rich  
But now it's like an itch  
'cause I love the music  
They say I do it for the money  
And it's funny, clockin' all the honeys:  
The ones that used to dis  
Now they want to kiss  
Lookin' at what my troops got  
Now they're getting their boots knocked  
Damn it's a shame - do I love 'em  
No I don't ""G""  
A couple of years ago, they didn't want me  
Now I got these so called friends  
It's down with the Ice, 'cause they know I'm makin' ends  
But my real friends have been friends through the fame  
An' since I have fame ain't a damn thing changed  
Yo I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 3]  
And let me tell you about the pros and the cons  
Fame only lasts if you keep droppin' them bombs  
Now in the public eye - you know I'm havin' to admit it  
You become a target for a whole lot of critics  
Reporters stickin' to ya like white on rice  
Now everywhere I go they want to interview the Ice  
Before every show it's like I'm steadily surrounded  
By all of my fans and the media's houndin'  
This is not a dis 'cause I love all my fans  
But the media doesn't really understand  
They take what ya say, twist it around into lies  
And the next thing ya know  
A bunch of rumors start to fly  
Then they try to make you out to be a straight liar  
And next you'll be the front page of the National Enquirer  
Oh what a price to pay to play this crazy game  
You betta' be prepared if you ever reach fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!

So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip  
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss  
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor  
I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for  
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large  
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage  
'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this  
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist

Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat

Move to the groove and try to hold your composure

I came to manifest, and express to this dope track  
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice  
That's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!  
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top  
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop  
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction  
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'  
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked  
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell  
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females  
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt  
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault  
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to  
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you  
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook  
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea  
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end  
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop  
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock

Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper  
Flip this thing and sting like a viper  
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent  
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it  
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe  
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal  
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal  
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about  
Money, yea, is the key to all problems  
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em  
'cause I got the key, the key to attack  
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track  
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit

Yeah, everybody let's move  
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove  
Gonna rock, And roll this place  
With the power of the ninja turtle bass  
Iceman, ya know I'm not playin  
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin

Ninja, Ninja, RAP! Ninja, Ninja, RAP! GO GO GO GO!  
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!  
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!  
GO GO GO GO!  
  
Lyrics, fill in the gap  
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP  
Feel it, if you know what I mean  
Give it up, for those heroes in green  
Just flowin, smooth with the power  
Kickin' it up, Hour after hour  
Cause in this life there's only one winner  
You better aim straight so you can hit the center  
In it to win it, With a team of four  
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the  
  
Chorus  
  
Villains you better run and hide  
Because one day you might not slide  
So choose, your weapon don't slip  
Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip  
Rockin' the crowd the way it should be rocked  
With the Miami drop that you like a lot  
You know it's hittin, Like a ninja turtle  
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level  
The power of the ninja is strong  
Fightin the crooks 'til they're all gone

Vanilla Ice,Scars,/v/vanilla+ice/scars_20143654.html,"[Verse 1]  
Reality sucks, too much pain  
I can't explain why I want to bash brains  
Still I can see it on the other side  
Got a new baby, want to stay alive  
Give what I give, give what I got  
Make it worth while, cause I got another shot  
Broken families that always got pain  
I break the chain, refuse to be the same  
Mother did as good as you could  
After all the abuse I still understood  
Three times divorced, and three times a kid  
Gave us more love than our father ever did  
Now we've all grown and moved along  
Tried to forget, but my brother did me wrong  
But it's real hard to put it all behind me  
It's like a tattoo frozen in a memory  
I can't seem to erase the stain  
In my brain, things will never be the same  
I remember all the lies, fucked up, now I realize  
Never had a chance as a kid, I was a man  
Fight after fight wasn't really what I planned  
Father!  
Whoever you are  
Beat my mother down, all I see is scars  
And memories - what about me?  
Throw me through a window for watching tv  
Where did I get this anger?  
Where did I get this hate?  
And where did I get my temper?  
Now I'm gonna show my faith  
(huh) never will I be like you, be like you  
Fucked up, that shit, I'm staying true  
My family, true to my family  
I'm true to my family  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
True  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
Never will I be like you, never will I be like you (Repeat to end)

Work them hips like a pistons in a corvette  
Slow down or I'll have to pull ya over  
Search ya, handcuff ya, and do a move on ya  
You get a gwb stands for girl with a body pump it like a hottie  
Seems like you got switches and you're hittin em  
Two wheel motion keep bumpin em  
Now throw it east to west and put a hump in it  
Back stroke, and boogie with a bump in it  
Tell me how ya do it like that, how ya got stacked  
How you scrambled like a quarter back

And all I want to do is make you dance

Don't you know my cream is good for your health?  
You know you want to shake what your mamma gave ya  
You're getting real hot, now I'm gonna spray ya  
Rub it in like lotion  
Juices flowin everywhere  
Like water in the ocean  
You got that hourglass figure

And crank it up like a 250  
Engine in a motorcross  
And make ya feel it girl  
Till ya get sick with it  
And all that junk in your trunk  
Don't be stingy with it  
And I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend  
You got enough for yourself and for all my friends  
And it's enough of me to go round like the globe  
Set it up like a tent, watch it unfold  
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's  
But you ain't gotta fake it  
I just want you to shake it  
Break me off a piece of that action like jackson  
I ain't trying to hit it  
And I ain't trying to wax it  
Picture you and me on the beach and you be  
Climbing up this tall coconut tree  
All I want to do is hump with it and make you scream  
And eat you up  
As I floss with your g-string

Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice

This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me  
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second  
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked  
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane  
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything  
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly

And takin' out you motherfuckers acting two-faced  
For the people out there gonna blaze 'till I die

To please his master's son

Raised of demon seed  
Dying at the witching hour  
A virgin's soul for me  
Minds of magic conjugate  
The spells of potions purge  
Hold the black horse ready  
For the lord of this world

With you.  
Trying to get settled in  
After all we went through and  
Just breathing for a moment  
To see what we had  
Before it got stolen  
Can we get back this love?  
Just like we had this love  
Just like we had enough  
Just like we had  
  
Part of me knows that  
Part of you is broken  
'Cause I am broken too  
I'm broken over you and  
Most of me is certain  
That most of you is hurting  
'Cause I am hurting too  
I'm broken over you  
  
Try to make sense of it  
Someday  
The truth is so hesitant  
But there's more than just blame now  
Moving in silence  
Through every regret  
Still vivid inside us  
How can we get this love?  
Just like we had this love  
Just like we had enough  
Just like we had  
  
Part of me knows that  
Part of you is broken  
'Cause I am broken too  
I'm broken over you and

When the line is just forming  
I know you think I'm just carrying on  
When I've been where you're going  
And it's not worth knowing  
Burning the days I'm just carrying on

'Cause all of is contagious  
Knowing your head, no control of what you let go

Vertical Horizon,Children's Lullaby,/v/vertical+horizon/childrens+lullaby_20144019.html,"Little girl was down by the waterside  
The sun so hot and the roses so red where she lie  
As little boys sit and watch as she twirls all around  
Sunny smiles not a raincloud could bring that girl down  
But now...  
  
What's behind those big brown eyes  
Do you dream at night  
Without your lullaby  
  
Little boy sits alone as he sings in the dark  
Wondering if his own dreams had pulled them apart  
He sings a song of tomorrow he never can see  
Mostly sings of a lost little girl's memory  
And now...  
  
As his dreams go flashing by  
He begins to hear  
A lonely lullaby  
  
Well now...  
We used to sing  
And we used to cry  
Through everything  
In our children's lullaby  
  
Little girl on the street with nobody around  
Has her head in the air dirty feet on the ground  
She shuts her eyes and wonders if this is a mistake  
Now she's gone from the warmth of her little boy days  
And still...  
  
She believes that she'll get by  
On her own without  
Her little boy's lullaby  
  
Little boy prays to God to answer his song  
To hold her hand when everyone else's are gone  
Time goes by and the wounds slowly turn into scars  
So he makes his final wish on the midnight stars  
And he screams...  
  
Little girl won't you hear my cry  
Won't you come back home  
To your lover's lullaby  
  
Little girl down by the waterside  
Goodbye

Broken and lost swearing I'd never love that way again  
  
Even then you were aiming much higher  
Somewhere higher  
Then you thought i could fly  
  
Even then you were looking for rainbows  
Something more  
Then the cloudless blue sky  
  
Now you tell me you were wrong  
You never should have left me for an empty dream  
And now you spill out your regrets  
A mighty river to a bitter stream  
Lying awake thinking about all that might have been  
I guess we're even now  
I guess we're even now  
  
Even now  
More often then I'd like  
I think of you and the place we used to share

I remember all the songs  
And the perfume in your hair  
I was carried away until you cut me down in mid air  
  
Even then  
There was something inside you  
Something bright  
That was burning so cold  
  
Even then  
There was something about you  
Something dark  
That I couldn't hold  
  
And now you tell me that your life  
Has never been the free flight you thought it would be  
And now you know it's way to late  
All we've got is history  
You know that when I lost you, you lost me

Trials tribulations  
And notes in the autumn nights  
  
We didn't know way back then  
What brothers we really were  
Letting the time pass quickly  
And watching it go  
  
But we stood together  
And we made each other strong  
We tried to comfort ourselves when the nights were long  
And we held back the tears  
When they needed to flow  
But where we once stood lie only footprints in the snow  
  
Even when it was hard  
To find a smiling face  
And when others would leave us  
Without a trace  
  
We never thought about tomorrow  
Or what she might bring  
We never stopped to realize  
That we might not always sing

Where we once laughed lie only tears in the snow

If you're lost and you need someone to count on  
Oh you've got to look to me  
Because it's times like these when a good friend is a saviour  
Oh you come running on back to me

We must be moving onward  
It's time for us to fly  
Take care and look over your shoulder  
I'm there all the time  
  
And someday when you're feeling awkward  
And someday when you're down  
Come to me I will give you anything  
I'll turn your frown around  
  
What you've done for me is more than I could hope for  
Oh you are my friend  
And I'll be there for you through happiness and sad times  
Oh our love will pull us through

Can't you see I'm tumbling down  
And like your favorite toy  
Boy I'm tired of being thrown around  
  
You lead me through this life of complication and delusion  
So you drop it in my lap and slap me back towards confusion  
When it's so hard to decide whether to live or to die in this destiny  
Tell me what would you say if at the end of the day it was just you and me  
  
Smile away the fears that only seem to run me around  
So you open up the door then the floor came crumbling down  
I've only one or two dreams there worth losing  
But they're unraveling, traveling down the road to ruin  
  
And the harder I try the more I slip and I slide through this fantasy  
All by myself I need your help to persevere  
But the same conclusions always greet me at my door  
Wouldn't it be nice to fade away  
And maybe one day you will show me what went wrong  
How did I become the unchosen one  
  
So when the rain is just around my corner  
Throw some sunshine down my way  
And I'll hit you with a smile all the while my worries melt away  
  
So won't you show me a sign as I continue to climb up this reality  
All by myself I need your help to persevere  
And the same conclusions always greet me at my door  
Wouldn't it be nice to fade away  
And maybe one day you will show me what went wrong  
So how did I become the unchosen one

No time for old fashioned potion

In a world dark and cold  
Night so still, winter's chill  
One bright star was shining  
On a bed made of hay  
In a manger He lay  
The shepherds came, they knew His name  
King of Kings, a brand new day  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on us in tenderness  
It brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night  
On this Christmas day  
May that star light your way  
This Christmas Eve, I still believe  
That same star still shines on me

It brings out the hope that's in all of us

Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow,  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you...

We've finally tasted something that's real

In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man

Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid the plans that we made

I was with a girl

I held her in my arms

The one thing that I love

Help me Lord

What it means to be a boy

Hands off the literature

It's killing me babe...  
Everyday...  
Nothing left...  
Nothing left at all to say..

If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again  
I can't erase these memories of you  
I can't forget the sweet kiss that I knew  
Oh, where is my pride, where is my shame?  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again

My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees  
I want you and I need you that's all I know  
And I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go  
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow I'd turn my back on everyone I know  
I'd do these things with no fear of tomorrow  
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go

Wanda Jackson,It'll Take Awhile,/w/wanda+jackson/itll+take+awhile_20533010.html,"Here I sit alone and broken hearted walk the floor all night since we parted  
I'll get over you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile hold by can't
last till then  
Yes it'll take awhile to shake the pain of losing you  
Someone will take your place but I don't know who  
The world outside holds nothing now for me it'll take awhile to shake your
memory

So I'll do my best to forget you as I think about the things we used to do  
And I'll forget you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile if I'll hold
out till then  
Yes it'll take awhile...

Wanda Jackson,I've Gotta Sing,/w/wanda+jackson/ive+gotta+sing_20533033.html,"The sun's shining beautiful and everything is going my way  
I've got a love that's wonderful he's always there with loving words to say  
Well I hold him close and let him know that to me he is my everything  
Without a word the world is mine just one look from him and I'm a queen  
A girl's gotta sing when she's got everything so now I'm singin' my song  
Now I've gotta sing cause he's my everything  
Don't you know I'm happy won't you sing along  
I'm singing la la la la la la la...  
I'm singing la la la la la la la...  
I can thank my lucky stars for the never ending love he gives to me  
When I'm by his side flame of love burns bright for all the world to see  
When he calls my name out low I can hear the bells begin to ring  
And happiness is all around that's the reason why I've gotta sing  
A girl's gotta sing...

I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street  
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
  
Where broken dreams and memories meet where's this place called Lonely Street  
Perhaps upon this Lonely Street there's someone such as I  
Who came to bury broken dreams and watch an old love die

It's true that nothing lasts forever I guess  
But your resentment is so strong that it shows  
You seem to like me better the more you see me less

The more I try the more you once set free  
To love you I done my very best but you like me better the more you see me
less

I can't believe it you're really gonna let me fall  
Cause the times that I gave you were my best

Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the night and realize you're gone  
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come  
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone  
But it cries the world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone
