Squeeze,Slightly Drunk,/s/squeeze/slightly+drunk_20129094.html,"Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought I'd write to you  
How can I say how I feel ?  
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake?  
I just hope that I'm awake  
I say alright I knew  
(I knew)  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I was wrong you were right  
(That's a line I cannot find)  
I could not say goodbye  
(to explain just why I lied)  
Why's it always feel the same?  
(slightly drunk what you said to me)  
I'm in love once again  
(can't fall in love without misery)  
  
I'm pretty sad but so what?  
I should be glad but I'm not  
I'm confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so that's tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
(once more)  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all, I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel

Squeeze,Some Americans,/s/squeeze/some+americans_20129056.html,"Some Americans are very pretty  
Some Americans are very shy  
Some Americans are Disney people  
Some Americans eat apple pie  
Some Americans scare me, the leader of the pack  
Living in this theater  
I'm waiting for the trap to drop in the show  
Some Americans gung ho  
  
Some Americans are very happy  
Some Americans will always win  
Some Americans are party people  
Some Americans go out and sing  
  
Some Americans are very lucky  
Some Americans are very poor  
Some Americans are burger people  
Some Americans say no to war

Squeeze,Some Fantastic Place,/s/squeeze/some+fantastic+place_20129293.html,"She gave to me her tenderness  
Her friendship and her love  
I see her face from time to time  
There in the sky above  
We grew up learning as we went  
What a voyage our life could be  
It took us through a wilderness  
Into the calmest sea  
Her smile could lift me from the pain  
I often found within  
She said some things I won't forget  
She made a few bells ring  
So simple her humility  
Her beauty found in grace  
Today she lives another life  
In some fantastic place  
She showed me how to raise a smile  
Out of a bed of gloom  
And in her garden sanctuary  
A life began to bloom  
She visualized a world ahead  
And planned how it would be  
She left behind the strongest love  
That lives eternally  
I have the hope that when it's time  
For me to come her way  
That she'll be there to show me around  
Whenever comes that day  
Her love was life and happiness  
And in her steps I trace  
The way to live a better life  
In some fantastic place, some fantastic place.

Squeeze,Tempted,/s/squeeze/tempted_20129217.html,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste  
A flannel for my face  
Pyjamas, a hairbrush  
New shoes and a case  
I said to my reflection  
Let's get out of this place  
Past the church and the steeple  
The laundry on the hill  
Billboards and the buildings  
Memories of it still  
Keep calling and calling  
But forget it all  
I know I will  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
What's been going on  
Now that you have gone  
There's no other  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
I'm at the car park, the airport  
The baggage carousel  
The people keep on crowding  
I'm wishing I was well  
I said it's no occasion  
It's no story I could tell  
At my bedside empty pocket  
A foot without a sock  
Your body gets much closer  
I fumble for the clock  
Alarmed by the seduction  
I wish that it would stop  
I bought a novel, some perfume  
A fortune all for you  
But it's not my conscience  
That hates to be untrue  
I asked of my reflection  
Tell me what is there to do

Squeeze,The Call,/s/squeeze/the+call_20129309.html,"It felt so bad that I'm in pain  
Then why don't I say no not again  
Your love has failed and all's gone sour  
You have to see her every hour  
When you can't sleep your mind is blank  
But you don't love no longer thinks  
You lose the grip you thought you had  
She smiles at you but you are sad  
So if then heaven sees in you  
Then suddenly its over, through  
You take your life into your hands  
Forgetting all your other plans  
  
And your so sad you cut your wrists  
And they can show you what they missed  
You labor now a point in pain  
But will your worst day ever end  
When you lose or when you've gained  
Don't give up, Don't start again  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone for good  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale  
Love can kill you suck you down  
Suicidal up - side down  
Love's a mystery to us all  
So don't be mistaken what a call  
  
Remember when we used to fight  
And fists would fly throughout the night  
Your face is filled with cherry blood  
And so I feel my time has come  
You tore me from the world I knew  
And suddenly its finished, through  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone foor good  
  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale

Squeeze,The Fortnight Saga,/s/squeeze/the+fortnight+saga_20129109.html,"Business as usual at the harmony home  
Up for the weekend to see my father  
So I'm the one beneath the unturned stone  
I begin the ritual fortnight saga  
Get in the cab, bags packed with clothes  
Cassette player, the jungle of hose  
A pair of shoes for walking in  
Out of the cab, the doorbell rings  
  
Hungover greetings from the man in my life  
A hug, a kiss, and a mug by the fire  
He says I should need a woman I might like  
I drop my bags and walk right by her  
  
Get in the bath, bubbles up high  
Cassette player plays in the night  
She's at the door, wants to come in  
I'm in the bath, I loudly sing  
  
Business as usual at the harmony home  
I can't believe it how time flies  
I'm waving

Squeeze,The Very First Dance,/s/squeeze/the+very+first+dance_20129321.html,"I had finally beat my nerve  
To watch her on the stage  
Removing all her clothes  
Revealing only age  
Some men stared with a stun  
Some sat in married guilt  
That night I chewed a brick  
For ideals I had built  
And there we were in each other's arms  
The very 1st dance that seemed to last  
For ever  
  
Our heads they almost touched  
Our feet beneath us moved  
Professional her dance  
And me the horses hoof  
The lights the beat the vision  
I'd conjured in my head  
Had magically appeared  
And disappeared again  
  
The music stopped we parted  
But only for a bar  
Off to the Bahamas  
Back into her arms  
The excitement of a kiss  
Quenched my lovers thirst  
We walked into the cold night  
A night to remember

Squeeze,There At The Top,/s/squeeze/there+at+the+top_20129048.html,"She's independent  
She's a modern woman  
She needs no prompting  
On her should 'n' shouldn't  
It's always bosses  
Who wish that she wouldn't  
Files in the cabinet so neatly numerical  
Makes all the clients so neatly alphabetical  
Turn of twenty one  
She's looking at the map  
Looking at her watch  
Bags on the rack  
It seems like she's there at the top  
  
There for her service  
Comfy red Granada  
Up to the midlands  
  
With a taped Sinatra  
Plans all the hotels  
And the airplane charters  
Found under covers with some representative  
The deal is effected but still only tentative  
  
Shorthands a letter  
Heading on the paper  
Slimline her lunch break  
Will it ever make her  
Slender and modern  
So all the men will take her  
Back to the mirror in the empress hotel  
Where the businessman smiles and the object is sell

I just can't pretend that  
The problem's not there

From where we both stand  
Our life has been happy  
Without any plan  
But now I feel sorrow  
As friendship turns stale  
Our love's still on track but  
Without a third rail  
The moon has come up now  
The sun has gone down  
A million or more times  
Since you've been around  
Our life still goes on but  
It won't be the same  
As when we're together  
Love only knows pain  
With words that are tender  
Our love will prevail  
But can our love go on  
Without a third rail  
  
White clouds appear like cotton wool  
The wind bends trees to bow  
As we farewell this love of ours  
Like some old sacred cow  
As sure as heaven's above us  
And hell is down below  
Without a third rail to drive us  
We'll have no place to go  
  
There's a lump in my throat  
I'm choked as I say  
Our love has reached twilight  
Let's call it a day  
We kiss on the platform  
The doors slowly close  
Like theatre curtains  
Pulled after the show  
We both know it's over  
And somehow we've failed  
Love's going in circles  
Without a third rail

Squeeze,To Be A Dad,/s/squeeze/to+be+a+dad_20129129.html,"I lost the children  
But they can be found  
Home in a red house just across town  
Sitting in boxes  
Of opened up toys  
Watching The Simpsons  
And making some noise  
I lost the children  
But they're in great hands  
When I cook the dinners  
Right out of tin cans  
I lost the children  
And I have to pay  
Some heavy duty on life everyday  
Cupboards need filling  
With deadlines to meet  
Here in my cheque book  
My fountain pen weeps  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
I lost the children  
They haven't lost me  
We're still together and happy to be  
Out in the summer  
On beaches in parks  
Home in the winter and up with the larks  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
From pushchairs to games of football  
My back was against every wall  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad

They haven't lost me

Squeeze,Vanity Fair,/s/squeeze/vanity+fair_20129146.html,"She left her school for the factory  
From pocket money to a salary,  
From a pac-a-mac to a compact case  
And every morning she inspects her face.  
She discovers pulling pints in pubs  
That the good looks will never cover up for  
Her dumbness in taking the stock  
Sees her reflection in a butcher's shop.  
She finds it all quite rare  
That her meat's all vanity fair.  
  
She has her eyes on medallion men  
Who get her home on the dot at ten,  
She combs her hair when she gets excused  
The deal she wants always ends up screwed.  
Paints her nails on the bathroom scales  
Gargles her breath like a landed whale,  
Her beauty is as deep as her skin  
Keeps her eyebrows in a tobacco tin.  
She poses foot on the chair  
Coconut shy but vanity fair.  
  
In her vanity case her compact case  
In her compact case her eyes,  
Not bad for a sister  
But her vanity's fair and her sense of humour's dry.  
She comes home late with another screw loose  
She swears to have had just a pineapple juice,  
Falls asleep fully clothed in her bed  
With her makeup remover by her head.  
And she might not be all there  
But her dream's all vanity fair.

Wrapped up in my football scarf

And how she would mother me  
She knew how to suffer me  
Like all mothers can  
Now she is everywhere  
The comb that runs through my hair  
My posture on a chair  
But that's not who I am  
He ran from the arguments  
And sat on the garden fence  
And lived in the passing tense  
That fell from her lips  
He tended the house so well  
And each time she rang his bell  
He'd climb back from where he fell  
And gathered his wits  
Now I fear the mold is mine  
A vibration shakes my spine  
As I walk the crooked line  
Reality hits  
  
So let me walk free from you  
You know that you want me to  
Let me try something new  
Let me walk away  
  
If it's not one thing it's your mother  
How I love her  
How I love her  
How I love her  
But it's not so easy to say  
Please won't you let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
  
So let me walk on my own  
And finish my ice cream cone  
If we are to make it home  
Then all will be well  
Look see I'm a father now  
I'm raising my own eyebrow  
And being in my own row  
And making life hell  
This is me, see here I am  
Doing the best that I can  
This life has a subtle plan  
But you couldn't tell

Squeeze,What The Butler Saw,/s/squeeze/what+the+butler+saw_20129245.html,"Pacing through the flickering light  
A velvet patch upon his eye  
His pacing creaks the floorboards loose  
As he tailors his thoughts for the truth around truths  
But his butler keeps eyes through a hole in the door  
What the butler don't see ain't a lot that's for sure  
Francesca lays across the couch  
They fight with words from mouth to mouth  
And then with handfuls of her flesh  
See how the zipper broke off of her dress  
Strangling her neck with his hands in her gloves  
The port and the brandy mix cocktails of love  
  
The porch light, the torchlight  
The frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw  
  
He kept his world all to himself  
And locked it tight inside his belt  
But she preferred his belt undone  
She bathed in his fortune but never his fun  
He cracked on a mixture of opera and drink  
The butler still fetches and carries for him  
  
The butler dragged down to the lake  
Francesca's body in a cape  
No private eye was gonna trace this  
The old man was shaking, his marbles were missed  
The shadows and footprints and flickering lights  
The butler's up late with a cold in his eye  
  
The porch light the torchlight the frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw

With my head in my lap  
  
There's a day to explore  
But I'm left without sense  
As the hangover strikes  
And I turn on the tap  
  
But the water's too loud  
And I'm caged by the fact  
That the battle's not lost  
Is it the hair of the dog  
  
Or the Baa of a Lamb  
In a sheepish attempt  
To be half of the man  
That I might be or was  
  
When the hangover strikes  
And a mirror reveals  
That it's Midnight or bust  
And a drink does appeal  
  
Now the battle is won  
So the cure of the can  
Pours its heart out on me  
Though I'm feeling locked up  
  
But I can't find the key

Pour pour pour, pour me another one

Sitting at a bar stool she gives her day's recital,

Makes herself a sandwich  
As they're looking through the doorway,

If love's a secret to all the things she fears  
Was it tiptoe around my pillow talk  
They'll come the only boy she had with any thought

She said tomorrow and I'm here today  
  
I miss her now and I say it's only true  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon

I'm forgettin' to remember to forget  
All the memories locked in my head  
I'll be home then you'll hear what I say  
It seems forever started only yesterday  
My heart keeps time which passes very slow  
When you're lonely without a place to go  
I've got the lonesome ocean blues  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
Across the ocean there's a heart that beats for me  
Beat, beating, waiting patiently  
Pulls us together when we're apart  
Keeps the devil from playing with your heart  
But I'll pretend we're not so far away  
I'm home tomorrow or maybe it's today  
Across the ocean there's nothing else to do  
It feels like you're on the wrong side of the moon

Found himself a beat and he played it near and far  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
He travelled round the world in a rock-n-roll band  
He stood there like a giant with a guitar in his hand  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Nobody cared about the clothes he would wear  
Nobody cared about the colour of his hair  
Everybody came to see and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
Now we've got the rhythm in us now we've got the rock  
Time didn't matter never living by the clock  
Everybody came to hear him playing his rock-n-roll  
  
Then came a line when the music didn't rhyme  
He couldn't find the rhythm 'cause he couldn't find the time  
But still the people came to listen to the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again

Pulled a low down lady with a long black honky-tonk car  
I asked no questions, I got no lies  
A one off winner, I didn't want any ties  
And I knew it wasn't right  
Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Took me down on the highway doing too many miles an hour  
And by the way she motored thought we might have made the Eiffel Tower  
She stopped the motor by her own front door  
I knew she'd done it so many times before  
But I was off of the floor  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I woke up next morning feeling kind of up and down  
'Cos I did not know if I was in or out of the town  
Then I saw the face from the night before  
My purse was empty lying there on the floor  
But like I told you before  
That, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I spend a low down evening sitting high on a honky-tonk stool  
And I spent my money like a low down honky-tonk fool  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules

Looking a good deal

Falling of the stage  
Tuning in to Wonga Queen  
Old men in boys' clothes  
Has gone beyond a joke  
Skin me another  
And pass along the Wiskey and the Coke

Heads down rockin' on up and down the country only  
Living from day to day

Steely Dan,Charlie Freak,/s/steely+dan/charlie+freak_20130137.html,"Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own  
Three weight ounce pure golden ring no precious stone  
Five nights without a bite  
No place to lay his head  
  
And if nobody takes him in  
He'll soon be dead  
On the street he spied my face I heard him hail  
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale  
  
Poor man, he showed his hand  
So righteous was his need  
And me so wise I bought his prize  
For chicken feed  
  
Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind  
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind  
Poor kid, he overdid  
Embraced the spreading haze  
  
And while he sighed his body died  
In fifteen ways  
  
When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay  
'Round his arm the plastic tag read D.O.A.  
Yes Jack, I gave it back  
The ring I could not own  
  
Now come my friend I'll take your hand  
And lead you home

At ramblers, wild gamblers

You call me a fool  
You say it's a crazy scheme  
This one's for real

So useless to ask me why  
Throw a kiss and say goodbye

And I want a name when I lose  
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide  
Call me Deacon Blues

A victim of laughing chance  
This is for me  
The essence of true romance  
Sharing the things we know and love  
With those of my kind  
Libations  
Sensations  
That stagger the mind  
  
I crawl like a viper  
Through these suburban streets  
Make love to these women  
Languid and bittersweet  
I'll rise when the sun goes down  
Cover every game in town  
A world of my own  
I'll make it my home sweet home

When your daddy was quite surprised  
To find you with the working girls

I was smoking with the boys upstairs  
When I heard about the whole affair  
I said oh no  
William and Mary won't do

Could be so cruel  
And I'm never going back  
To my old school

Soon they're gonna be in bloom  
Up in Annandale  
I can't stand her  
Doing what she did before  
Living like a gypsy queen  
In a fairy tale  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go  
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara won't do

California tumbles into the sea  
That'll be the day I go  
Back to Annandale

Through the U.S. Mail  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go

Could be the very same  
A wooly man without a face  
And a beast without a name  
Nothin' here but history

Stackin' cutouts at the Strand  
When in walks Franny from NYU  
We were quite an item back then  
  
We talked about her films and shows and CDs  
And I don't know what else  
She said yeah Hollywood's been good to me  
But tell me how about yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm still working on that novel  
But I'm just about to quit  
Cause I'm worrying about the future now  
Or maybe this is it  
It's not all that I thought it would be  
What a shame about me  
  
She said, talk to me, do you ever see  
Anybody else from our old crew  
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize  
Now he's coming out with something new  
  
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens  
And Barry is the software king  
And somebody told me in the early 80's  
You were gonna be the 'next big thing'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now that was just a rumor  
But I guess I'm doin' fine  
Three weeks out of the rehab  
Living one day at a time  
Sneaking up on the new century  
What a shame about me  
  
What a shame about me  
I'm thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise  
And the goddess on the fire escape was you  
  
We both ran out of small talk  
The connection seemed to go dead  
I was about to say, hey, have a nice life  
When she touched my hand and said:  
  
You know I just had this great idea  
This could be very cool  
Why don't we grab a cab to my hotel  
And make believe we're back at our old school  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said babe you look delicious  
And you're standing very close  
But like this is Lower Broadway  
And you're talking to a ghost  
Take a good look it's easy to see  
What a shame about me  
What a shame about me

You were the man that I saw running from his door  
You owed him money but you gave him something more  
With a gun  
With a gun  
  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain?  
  
You were the founders of the clinic on the hill  
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till  
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill

And you've seen all the western movies  
Woe to the one who does you wrong  
You hide in the bushes  
Murder the man  
With Luger in hand  
  
I understood that you will soon be leavin' town  
Don't try to call me when they finally run you down  
Just give fair warning any time you come around

As I sail from season's four  
To join some crazy ladies  
In a game upon the shore  
None of them with broken wings  
But still refuse to fly  
So with sweetness on my lips  
I smile a last goodbye  
And now I spend my life  
On the velvet side of hell  
Aimlessly here searching  
For what I cannot tell  
The quietness is terrible  
It's more than I can stand  
But thousands now stand cheering  
As my blood flows in the sand  
Spoken: You're not the child  
You thought you were  
You wake up in the night  
And know you're blind  
And yet they keep on pushing  
Trying the insides of your mind  
Forever, forever arresting to control  
Until the emptiness of heaven welcomes your weary soul  
Rise up with the new dawn's early morning  
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face  
Tomorrow's come a long, long way to help you  
Yes, it's your saving grace  
Every day, every way  
Tomorrow, it's your saving grace  
Well, now got no time to worry  
Cause I've got no time to hurry

Don't you play those games on me

Roaches live with us wall to wall,  
  
You've killed all our leaders,  
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,  
You'll cause your own country to fall.

How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?

In the palm of your hand  
The entire universe  
As a tiny grain of sand  
And it feels impossible to do  
As I can't imagine love without you

With it's salty waters dry  
Sprinting 'round the world three times  
Faster than a rocket fly's  
And the thought of it you can't pursue

Not worth the amount of time  
Yet others inconceivable  
So they never cross your mind

Add up every single star  
Since the day the first was light  
How and when they started, I have no clue

Stevie Wonder,Cold Chill,/s/stevie+wonder/cold+chill_20131754.html,"Feelin' young and full of fun  
Hangin' out with my crew  
Hot to trot and about to pop  
Tryin' to find some girl to get into  
  
There she was fine as can be  
Hair braided down to her knees  
She took me home, she turned me out  
But before sunrise she said I must leave  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night  
  
Far from meek, and feelin' chic  
Refusing to concede defeat  
There I was same crew, same time  
Same club we kicked it at the previous week  
  
I asked her how could she have the nerve  
To treat me with such disgrace  
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized  
Threw her drink right in my face  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right

Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
A cold chill, a cold chill, a cold chill, cold chill  
  
Weekends came and weekends passed  
But not the yearning in my heart  
And there she was to light the spark  
Like she did right from the very start  
  
I took no time, drove to her house  
Got deep into a passion high  
I heard a knock, the turn of a key  
And the voice of another guy  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn

Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
  
It was a cold chill  
Like standing in the deep freeze  
A cold chill  
Like when snow's above your knees  
Cold chill  
Like sitting at the north pole  
A cold chill  
Wearing not one stitch of clothes  
Cold chill  
Like a winter Chicago night  
A cold chill  
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite  
Cold chill  
Stranded in sub-zero degrees  
A cold chill  
Laid out on the arctic sea  
Cold chill  
When your fingers get frost bite  
A cold chill  
Buried beneath ten feet of ice  
Cold chill  
Baby, that ain't so nice  
A cold chill

Be surprised what you'll find

Take the magic of a mystery tour  
But I felt so all alone  
Though I could almost touch the stars  
I started missing things I touched before  
The tour was such a bore

Where everyone greeted with a morning smile  
I mean the place was so free from crime  
You could leave your front door open  
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food  
Or your pockets were short on cash  
There was always someone close at hand  
That you could always run to  
  
You could have been a doctor  
And you could have been a nurse  
But these things weren't good enough for you  
So you decided to pack up all you own  
And get a one-way ticket there  
To a place where all the successful people went  
In order for them to do

You get off the bus, pick up a paper  
And look through the classified  
So that you might find a place  
Suitable for you to move into  
Then you turn around to pick up the duffel bag  
That you brought along  
But much to your surprise you find  
Your bag has taken off walking  
  
You dig in your wallet  
To get your last dime  
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper  
You're much too prideful  
But pride has no defense  
When all you've got in your possession  
Is the wallet in your hands  
  
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive

But not want everything you get  
Being in la la land is like nowhere else  
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels  
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day  
And that's enough to make anybody go wild  
In the land of la la  
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl

It's hotter than July.  
Though the world's full of problems  
They couldn't touch us even if they tried.  
From the park I hear the rhythms  
  
Marley's hot on the box  
Tonight there will be a party  
On the corner at the end of the block.  
  
Didn't know you would be jammin'

I bet you nobody ever told you

You would be jammin' an jammin' and  
Jammin'  
Jam on.  
  
They want us to join their fighting  
But our answer today  
Is to let all our worries  
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away.  
Peace has come to Zimbabwe  
Third world's right on the one  
Now's the time for celebration  
'Cause we've only just begun.

Well as a matter of fact  
I can say that I'm ecstatic  
'Cause we all just made a pact.  
We've agreed to get together  
Joined as children in Jah

Your destination is the brightest star.

Their knowledge fewer cared about what plants could do  
For most felt it was mad to conceive  
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we  
But with instruments Bose would devise  
Would take science itself by a surprise, so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where there's still non-believers  
What will it take for heaven sakes  
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in  
It's that same old story again  
Born of slaves who died too soon to realize  
The need his life would be  
Selflessly he gave  
His wisdom to a way where first no minds would see  
He said, ""If farm land was to be rich  
We must plant crops to replenish it""  
But it took him persuasion and tests  
To convince them Canver's way was best, so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where there's still non-believers  
What will it take for heaven sakes

From head down to her toes

That lovely wonderment  
But I start to shaking, I shiver, to think that little sparkle in your eye  
Means you are giving me some kind of hint  
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm able  
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue  
Eagerly waiting for me to say

And that is how I'm living  
  
I'm clinging, not dreaming, but scheming  
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize  
I think it, I trust it, I know it  
Your love that I've longed for is gonna be mine  
Good things do come in time  
I'm right on the rhythm you're givin'

They opened up all the wounds of the past

So let's just get on with the past  
  
How many times you ever hear me say  
I'm as flawed as any other human being?  
There simply has to be a different way  
And a whole new way of seeing  
Are we doomed by all our history?  
Is our love really beyond repair?  
It's getting close to midnight baby  
And we ain't got time to spare  
  
Just when I think I'm home and dry  
And she's given up the fight  
There's an unmistakable optimism  
In romantic music and candlelight  
There's this lingering perfume  
The merest ghost of the past  
She says wait a minute baby  
You're moving way too fast  
We'd better check the weather chart  
Before we raise this mast  
We'd best consult our horoscope  
In case this feeling wasn't meant to last

The royal astrologer was run out of breath  
He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death

Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
Well the land was cracking and the river was dry  
All the crops were dying when they ought to be high  
So to save his farm from the banker's draft  
The farmer took out a book on some old witchcraft  
He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night  
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight  
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
The sun won't shine 'til the clouds are gone  
The clouds won't go 'til their work is done  
And every morning you'll hear me pray

And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""

With tales of a stormy south  
But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree  
There came a dryness in my mouth  
Came a dryness in my mouth  
For then without rhyme or reason  
The two birds did rise up to fly  
And where the two birds were flying  
I swear I saw you and I  
I swear I saw you and I  
I walked out this morning  
It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes  
For the first time I saw the work of heaven  
In the line where the hills had been married to the sky  
And all around me every blade of singing grass  
Was calling out your name and that our love would always last  
And inside every turning leaf  
Is the pattern of an older tree  
The shape of our future  
The shape of all our history  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Came things I'd never seen  
Things I'd never seen  
I was brought to my senses  
I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature  
Said you belong to me  
I know it's true  
It's written in a sky as blue  
As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes  
If nature's red in tooth and claw  
Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw  
The wounds she gave me  
Were the wounds that would heal me  
And we'd be like the moon and sun  
And when our courtly dance had run  
Its course across the sky  
Then together we would lie  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Something new would arrive  
Something better would arrive

I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature

At times like this, a lonely man like me needs love

Pondering the motion of time

Dipped in wine

The night air now restless and dank  
Yet the fields are specked with flowers  
Few and rank  
  
Moon reflecting off the water

Gets herself dressed just in time, disappears on the 8:05  
Oh the whistle blows and it's all in a day's work  
'Til she calls it a day  
  
Oh she smiles as he glances up from the swimsuit issue  
Oh she sighs as he walks away into the downtown day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
It's all in a day's work  
  
Turning pages while the memories pass  
Familiar faces from her senior class  
How the years go by when it's all in a day's work  
""Dearest Ruby, hope you reach your star  
Don't ever change, stay as sweet as you are""  
And when a teardrop falls she calls it a day's work  
She calls it a day  
  
Oh she waits by the telephone for the call he promised  
Oh it's late  
She puts her heart away for another day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
All in a day's work

Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
Did you ever in good time think  
my life had gone amiss?  
Now I feel I've been unfair  
'cause I catch you hanging there.  
Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
My damnedest try to make it work,  
I knew it never would.  
Now there's nothin' wrong with you,  
and there's nothing you could ever do.  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory.  
I'm sorry, there's another face  
one that's close to me.  
You know 'bout what I learned  
and there's no stone left unturned.  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory. (Sigh)

Looking through the mirror  
At the maze of my past  
It was never clearer  
  
On the distant horizon  
The sun approaches  
Better cover my eyes  
Better hide the roaches  
  
In the best of my time  
There was something better  
And the quest of my mind  
Was to try and get her  
  
Something simple and pure  
As the thoughts in my head  
Not the tears in the rain  
Over me she shed  
  
We were almost there  
Still I was unaware  
  
Here in the Brave New World's embrace  
I watch the parade begin  
Searching for one familiar face  
And I wonder where I fit in  
How will I know if there's a place  
For me in the Brave New World  
  
To be calm in the eye  
Of the human storm  
In house full of dreams  
I am safe and warm  
  
Looking back at a life  
Filled with warm embraces  
No regrets only memories  
Of smiling faces  
  
We were almost there  
Now change is in the air  
  
Until now I held the zone  
I ruled the world  
I called it home  
I never saw the down side  
  
See the now see the Zen  
There is no division  
Through the eyes of a child  
There is perfect vision  
  
And the best of our lives  
Resonate the hills  
And the sun's gonna shine  
And you know that I will

Moonlit water falls

So afraid I'd lost my soul  
  
There in the fog his song kept calling me  
Leading me on with its haunting melody  
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing  
I knew I'd soon be wandering  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where the distant harbour meets the sky  
There the battle raged like hell  
And every dove had lost its will to fly  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say  
Life is never what it seems  
And every man must meet his destiny

Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
Pretty faces up on the silver screen  
Flawless bodies on covers of magazines  
They all look perfect to us  
So rich and cool and bored  
But hold the presses boys  
They've checked into Betty Ford  
  
Turns out nobody's perfect  
From ""A"" to ""Z""  
It's best to follow your heart  
Then to follow me  
Cause I'm only a singer  
Playin' a song  
And I've just been making it up  
As I went along  
  
See I met a man who told me once  
""Sincerity's the key  
And once you learn to fake it  
Son you're gonna be home free""  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall

And picture the plains  
I see Buffalo Bill and the Iroquois  
Riding again  
  
Open skies, fertile ground  
This was heaven on earth  
That they found  
  
We got what they gave  
By their God we were saved  
They were humble not depraved  
These streets we're afraid of  
Once were the fields of the brave  
The fields of the brave  
  
Where a Chevrolet rusts  
By a closed shopping mall  
Can you see through the dust  
Where the brave ones stood tall  
  
Buried deep where they fell  
They live on in the stories we tell  
  
They got what they gave  
By their God they were saved  
And I say this as I pray  
I can't help but dream of  
The days these were fields of the brave  
The fields of the brave  
  
After all this time  
And the struggles in between  
We stand next in line  
With the chance we can build on their dreams  
In the  
  
Fields of the brave  
Fields of the brave  
We got what they gave  
  
In the fields of the brave  
Let their spirits be saved  
And I pray this on their graves  
There'll be a return of  
The days these were fields of the brave

But you can't forget the places you've been  
And you can't erase a lifetime of sin  
And you can't escape the answers as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Dredging the river for what you have done  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin

Krakatoa you've changed your ways  
from evil days.  
Oh I know a once violent isle  
and gentle smile.  
When the dust and lava cooled  
you were sterile as the rock from which the earth was tooled.  
Was man's beginning a wind borne spore  
to fly no more?  
Nature's winning her docile spree  
has set her free.  
Seeds were wafted on the wind  
forming heavy undergrowth for species winged and finned.  
Tangled mangles rebuilt your soil  
from age dead toil.  
Sheltered bay coves protecting life  
from Satan's knife.  
Grow and island in the sun  
where the hell fire belching earth had destructively left none.

And everywhere I look Mr. Loneliness is in the news  
I've got the Big Star Blues  
  
Boy, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
I'm so together and I act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong  
I'm still surprised  
I've done my duty and paid a fortune in dues  
Still got them Mother Nature's Blues

Like a yo-yo  
Up and down  
  
Take this little pill  
And life will be so mellow  
You'll feel the world  
Start slowing down around  
  
Who's that rushing out the door  
Who's not taking any more  
Who's been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me who's number one  
Who's not here  
Who's having fun  
Who's the one who cares this much  
About you  
  
You won't feel the pain  
You won't mind the rain  
You can be happy all the time  
All the time  
One dose twice a day  
The world will go away  
You'll be smiling through

scone...""  
  
Oh what a beautiful night  
Couldn't get any clearer  
Yeah what a wonderful sight  
My old life in the rear view mirror  
  
Hey now I'm travelin' light  
Duffel bag and a six string  
Yeah but it feels so right  
To hear the bells of freedom ring  
  
Gotta get away from  
The same old same  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
Hey I was stuck in a grind  
Little fish in a little pond  
If I had a criminal mind  
I'd have got myself a gun  
  
Had to get away from  
The ball and chain  
Let a new day come  
Or start goin' insane  
  
I'm on my way  
Don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
With my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight  
  
Hey I was going to seed  
Spreading out like a corn field  
I had so much denial to feed  
I was full of nothing real  
  
I had to get away from  
My old routine  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
I'm on my way  
I don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
Through my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I get to feel  
So good  
So high tonight  
  
Starting tonight  
There will be  
A revival  
In my world  
  
Turn on the lights  
And you'll see  
This one man band  
Is now a symphony  
  
And the sun  
Is gonna shine  
Like a summer time  
That has no end  
  
And the love  
I will find  
I have no doubt  
That it will be mine  
The love I find  
Will all be mine  
  
I had to get away while  
I could still be saved  
Let a new day come  
Stop digging my grave  
  
On my way...  
I have faith  
The road up ahead  
Gonna get much easier  
  
On my way  
Look at me now  
With a brand new life  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight

It's six o'clock  
Good morning sounds are everywhere  
The warmth of spring, a gentle breeze blows through my hair  
  
I hurry through my life never stopping to see  
How beautiful it was meant to be  
  
I'm just a prisoner in a king's disguise  
Broken dreams as we shuffle by  
  
It's six o'clock it's quitting time I'm done for the day  
Out on the streets I overheard a lady say  
We now have everything or so people say  
But now this emptiness haunts me every day  
We seek the lion's share never knowing why  
Come alive spread your wings and fly  
  
Pieces of eight  
The search for the money tree  
Don't cash your freedoms in for gold  
Pieces of eight  
Can't buy you everything  
Don't let it turn your heart to stone

Showed within your face  
I felt the cold mist round your hand  
Like death was in its place

Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
I'll be with you in the sunshine, sand

He knelt down by your bed  
He looked at you, he held your hand  
Then he shook his head  
The child you want won't give the love  
You both want to get  
As your wife come quickly now  
Cos she has not long to live  
He said--  
  
Lord, Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
I'll be with you in the sunshine, sand  
  
Every day I go to kiss, the ground in which you lay  
Your golden hair has turned to dust  
Your smile has turned to clay  
The pain I felt for 15 years  
This life won't take a win  
And I will lie within your arms  
By the evening of this day

Well, my hands were steady, my aim was true  
But deep inside of my heart I knew  
That I lacked the will  
I just couldn't shoot to kill  
  
And still she treats me like a human  
She says she'll still be there  
I may not be a hero, but I'll be there  
Because I know she cares  
  
I worked hard to be the greatest lover  
I wanted to be sure that I was her only one  
That's how I thought it was done  
But I went too far, assumed too much  
The need to feel a younger one's touch  
Seemed important then  
Oh what a fool I've been

Cast an eye this way  
You with that young lust virgin smile  
Don't pretend that you're quickly melting before my eyes

'Cause I see all of you  
Quite clearly now  
I like our looks your moves you know everything  
So when I ring you up in the evening I shall meet you  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of man's delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
  
Your magic lips  
Have made me realize  
All of the pleasures man can fantasize  
So don't pretend that you're sad to see me say goodbye  
That's a lie  
  
You're a wicked wench...ha  
But thanks for all the laughs  
You and your young lust virgin smile  
And when I'm gone for awhile  
I'll once more want to meet you

In the abyss of space  
From the center of time  
A superman race  
Moves the Serpent to climb  
  
The journey has lasted  
Seven ages or more  
Life after life  
Must pass through the door  
  
The secret revealed  
When you leave your cave  
Is a glory of thunder  
And life from the grave  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The people have massed  
In the center of town  
We drink from a glass  
And the world turns around  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind

In the scattered ruins still speak to me  
  
If the flickering light of your campfire dims  
The world grows smaller  
It's closing in

Believe in the days of high times and innocence  
Drawing the lines and shouting back to the night  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
And from those who've seen the light beyond  
We know the end will bring tranquility  
But the voices of the friends they heard  
Brought them back to this reality

The sun's coming up on the world we're in  
There are choices here  
And I want you to live

Portends you and I

I did what little kids did

Had a drink about a hour ago  
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell  
  
She heard a noise and she looked through the door  
And saw a man she'd never seen before  
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile  
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door  
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar  
""My brand new car is parked right outside  
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""  
And she said ""Wait a minute I have to think.""  
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""  
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car  
And they drove away someplace real far  
  
Now babe the time has come  
How'd ya like to have a little fun?  
And she said ""If we could only please be on our way, I will not run.""  
  
That's when things got out of control  
She didn't want to, he had his way  
She said, ""Let's go""  
He said, ""No way!""  
Come on babe it's your lucky day  
Shut your mouth, were gonna do it my way  
Come on baby don't be afraid  
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid  
  
He finished up and he started the car  
He turned around and drove back to the bar  
He said ""Now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad.""  
She picked up a rock.,threw it at the car, hit him in the head, now he's got a
big scar  
Come on party people won't you listen to me  
Date rape stylee  
  
The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law,  
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass
to court  
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""She lies that
little slut!""  
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years  
And now his eyes are full of tears  
One night in jail it was getting late  
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed  
But the guards paid no attention to his cries  
  
That's when things got out of control  
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny.  
But that's the way it had to be  
They locked him up and threw away the key  
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind  
Even though he now takes it in the behind

Because that's just how we are  
  
Everyday I wonder if it's over  
When I wake up realizin' that we hate  
And brake down the war  
  
You say it's black, but I can't believe you  
  
And if you say it's white,  
You say I'm tryin' to deceive you  
  
And I'm aware of the high and the low,  
And I'd be waiting for you in the middle but I just lack control  
  
Baby if you want to get low  
  
Oh baby if you want to get high  
  
It makes no sense at all

I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that  
  
I shot dead

Not a chill to the window but a little to the air  
From another direction she was calling my eye  
It could be an illusion but I might as well try  
Might as well try  
  
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes  
And I knew without asking she was into the blues  
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls  
I knew right away she was not like other girls, like other girls  
  
Well I ain't never been right as I ain't never been wrong  
As everything works out the way it does in this song  
Cause once in a while you get shown in the light  
In the strangest of places if you look at it right  
  
It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above  
Because the women took a lovin' over me  
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus  
Because I sold off all my personal property  
  
A tie-tie-dyed dress, she was a psychedelic mess  
We toured to the north, south, east and west  
We sold some mushroom tea,  
We sold some ecstasy,  
We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP  
And now I hear the police coming after me  
Yes now I hear the police coming after me  
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair,  
She's got the police coming after me  
  
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves  
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues  
And there ain't nothin' wrong with the love that's in her eyes  
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by, let her pass by.  
Oh just let her pass by

In a spiral to the ground

I was on a Paris train  
I emerged in London rain  
And you waiting there swimming through apologies  
  
I remember searching for the perfect words  
I was hoping you might change your mind  
I remember the soldier standing next to me  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I was smiling as you took my hand  
Saw the mood we spoke in France  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
I can see you now smiling as I pulled away..  
Sorry  
  
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand  
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes  
I remember the night we walked along the Seine  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I remember a feeling coming over me  
The soldier turned, then walked away  
Fuck you for loving me

And she was taking off her dress

Rising up above the earth  
Moving into the universe  
Drifting this way and that  
Not touching ground at all  
Up above the yard

She isn't sure what she's done  
No time to think about what to tell him  
No time to think about what she's done

And things were looking like a movie

Isn't it weir  
Looks too obscure to me  
Wasting away  
And that was their policy  
I'm ready to leave  
I push the fact in front of me  
Facts lost  
Facts are never what they seem to be  
Nothing there!

Making a list  
Find the cost of opportunity  
Doing it right  
Facts are useful in emergencies

Whenever we close out eyes  
Lifting my head  
Looking around inside.  
Facts are simple and facts are straight  
Facts are lazy and facts are late  
Facts all come with points of view  
Facts don't do what I want them to  
Facts just twist the truth around  
Facts are living turned inside out  
Facts are getting the best of them  
Facts are nothing on the face of things  
Facts don't stain the furniture  
Facts go out and slam the door  
Facts are written all over your face

Softly he glides along the streets and alleys  
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover

He thought that some of these faces might be right for him...  
And through the years, by keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his
mind...  
Or somewhere in the back of his mind...  
That he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his
ideal...  
The change would be very subtle...It might take ten years or so...  
Gradually his face would change its' shape...  
A more hooked nose...wider, thinner lips...beady eyes...a larger forehead.  
He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people...  
They had also molded their faced according to some ideal...  
Maybe they imagined that their new face would better  
Suit their personality...Or maybe they imagined that their  
Personality would be forced to change to fit the new appearance...  
This is why first impressions are often correct...  
Although some people might have made mistakes...  
They may have arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them...  
They may have picked an ideal appearance based on some childish  
Whim, or momentary impulse...  
Some may have gotten half-way  
There, and then changed their minds.  
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake.

They are making plans that have far reaching effects.  
And the girls want to be with the girls.

You might think she would say something,  
But you'd have to wait a while.  
  
Well the lady don't mind.  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind  
She just turns her head and disappears,  
I kinda like that style  
  
Little boat that floats on a river,  
it's drifting through a haze  
She stops by whenever she wants to,  
well, there she goes again  
  
Well, it's no trouble at all.  
No, no, no trouble at all  
Well, what she does  
Is all right with me, and  
I kinda like that style  
  
Come on. come on. I go up and down.  
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.  
It's like make believe.  
Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying.  
I'm not lost but I don't know  
Where I am. I got a question.  
All right. All right.  
This is what we like.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What I'm thinking  
  
She says love is not what she's after,  
And everyone knows.  
Each time she looks in the mirror,  
She lets her feelings show.  
  
Well, the lady don't mind  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind.  
Well, what she says is all right by me,  
And I kinda like that style  
  
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again  
I don't know, I don't know,  
What I'm sayin'.  
Hey man. Hey man.  
I sure don't feel the same  
She likes to say what she's feeling  
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.  
I know you think so.  
Come on. Come on. She says anything.

The removal of the insides

We're order than we realize  
...in someone's eyes  
  
A frequent returning  
And leaving unnoticed  
A condition of mercy  
A change in the weather  
  
A view to remember  
The center is missing  
They question how the future lies

The gentle collapsing  
Of every surface  
We travel on the quiet road

And share the same space for a minute or two

And then he walks up, up to the throne  
  
He's makin' shapes with his hands

Ooh what a day that was.

Roaming in the streets  
They have lost all their possessions  
They have nothing left to eat  
  
Down come a bolt of lightning  
Start an electrical storm  
Starts a chain reaction  
Go pull a fire alarm

It was my own invention  
I put the wheels in motion  
A time for big decisions

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.

For us to finally win  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah  
  
So we've been outnumbered  
Raided and now cornered  
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair  
We're getting stronger now  
Find things they never found  
They might be stronger  
But we're faster and never scared  
You can walk away, say we don't need this  
But there's something in your eyes  
Says we can beat this

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees  
Fight for what we've worked for all these years  
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives  
But we'll stand up champions tonight  
  
It was the night things changed  
Can you see it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

All the things that we wished they would always do  
What if happiness came in a cardboard box

If you were wondering  
Lately I can never tell  
  
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time

I've been doing fine without you, really  
Up until the nights got cold  
And everybody's here, except you, baby  
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
Merry Christmas everybody  
That'll have to be something I just say this year  
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater  
And were your cousins late again  
When you were putting up the lights this year  
Did you notice one less pair of hands

4 AM, the second day,  
How strange that I don't know you at all.  
Stumbled through the long goodbye,  
One last kiss, then catch your flight,  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself don't get attached,  
But in my mind I play it back,  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
I don't wanna need you this way,

The delicate beginning rush,  
The feeling you can know so much,  
Without knowing anything at all.  
And now that I can put this down,  
If I had known what I know now,  
I never would have played so nonchalant.  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets,  
That never bring you back to me,  
I can't help but wish you took me with you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in London today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game,  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ""run as fast as you
can""

Don't you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?  
I should've known  
  
You are an expert at sorry,  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry  
Have tired, lifeless eyes  
'Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,  
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy

But I remember how it was back then  
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing  
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,  
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street  
Flashback to a night when you said to me,  
""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you  
Not before I knew how much I had to lose""

And its the song called Our Last Night

The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.  
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar

And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played, and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
Oh oh yeah  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made

I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy  
That's fine!  
I'll tell mine  
You're gay  
By the way  
  
I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
There's no time for tears,  
I'm just sitting here  
Planning my revenge  
There's nothing stopping me  
From going out with all of your best friends  
And if you come around saying sorry to me  
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
If you're missing me,  
You'd better keep it to yourself  
'Cause coming back around here  
Would be bad for your health  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
In case you haven't heard  
  
I really really hate that

Taylor Swift,Red,/t/taylor+swift/red_21035843.html,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Loving him was red  
  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front
of you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that
strong  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Oh red  
Burning red  
  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible  
When I still see it all in my head  
Burning red  
Burning it was red  
  
Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
'Cause loving him was red  
Yeah, yeah red  
We're burning red  
  
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  
Comes back to me, burning red  
Yeah, yeah  
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

Taylor Swift,Ronan,/t/taylor+swift/ronan_21042046.html,"I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I remember your little laugh  
Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back  
  
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  
I can still feel you hold my hand  
Little man, from even that moment I knew  
You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember the drive home when the blind hope  
Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And it's about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital  
We'll just disappear  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I love you to the moon and back

Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around

You touch me once and it's really something

I sneak in and see your friends,  
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,  
Somewhere back inside a room,  
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,  
This is surely not what you thought it would be,  
I lose myself in a daydream,  
Where I stand and say

Of the church at the back door,  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,""  
And they said, ""Speak now""  
  
Fond gestures are exchanged,  
And the organ starts to play  
A song that sounds like a death march,  
And I am hiding in the curtains,  
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,  
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,  
But I know you wish it was me,  
You wish it was me, don't you?

I hear the preacher say,  
""Speak now or forever hold your peace,""  
There's a silence, there's my last chance,  
I stand up with shaking hands,  
All eyes on me,  
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,  
But I'm only lookin' at you

And you say, ""Let's run away now,

Picks me up play one night out the window we were 17 and crazy

As I'm looking around the room,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
And the hours pass by,  
Now I just wanna be alone,  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When there's something really wrong,  
So they follow me down the hall,  
And there in the bathroom,  
I try not to fall apart,  
And the sinking feeling starts,  
As I say hopelessly,  
""He said he'd be here.""  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
And asking me about you,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know?  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didn't show?  
  
You should've been here.  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all standing around me singing  
""Happy birthday to you"",  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
Ooh, I knew.  
Ooh,  
  
You called me later,  
And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,""  
And I said, ""I'm sorry too,""  
And that was the moment I knew.

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs  
Staring at the phone  
I keep going back over, things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldn't see  
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you

To make this right again'  
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I

With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carried me from your car up the stairs  
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess, I need you

Tears For Fears,Badman's Song,/t/tears+for+fears/badmans+song_20135565.html,"Heard every word that was said that night  
When the light of the world put the world to right  
  
Well here's to the boys back in 628  
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate  
  
I will shine a blinding light  
Through those hearts as black as night  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But as least the seeds of love will be sown  
  
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame  
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain  
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case  
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face  
Hand on my heart I will make a stand  
For the life and the times of the mirror man  
  
In my head there is a mirror  
When I've been bad, I've been wrong  
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me  
Hope for a Badman  
This is the Badman's Song  
  
Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass  
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass  
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man  
Try and fit themselves together again  
Lies in disguise in the name of trust  
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust!  
What's your problem? What's your curse?  
Won't it make the matter worse?  
  
In my head...  
  
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains  
Fire can cleanse your soul ""  
Faith can move mountains  
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter, no!  
  
I heard every word that was said that night  
When the light of the world put the world to right  
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day  
  
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong  
When the stories are tall as the day is long  
With such a thin line drawn between friend and foe  
Lord help me now and bless my soul!  
  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking, they start shaking  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking and you don't, don't, don't don't know why  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
  
Well there's food for the saints that are quick to judge me  
Hope for a Badman.

Deep as the ocean, they named a sea after you

If you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
We're gonna walk and don't look back

And don't look back, oh yeah yeah  
And don't look back baby  
(Don't look back)  
(The places behind you, let them remind you)  
  
If your first lover broke your heart  
There's something that can be done  
(You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it)  
Don't end your faith in love  
Because of what he's done  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on walking and don't look back  
Forget about the past now  
Don't look back, baby  
Keep on walking and don't look back. Hmmm  
(The places behind you, let them remind you)  
  
Love can be a beautiful thing  
Though your first love let you down  
Oh yeah, yeah  
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby  
The second time around  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on pushing and don't look back  
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl  
Keep on walking and won't look back  
Forget about the past now, baby

Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through

You'll find every word is true.  
Junk man standing on the corner  
Selling death, no conscience has he.  
  
In the name of God, won't somebody stop him  
Stop him, think about the children  
Its a matter of life and death, you see.  
Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger,  
We've got to face reality.  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
Don't turn your back on this problem, people,  
Too much depends on you and me.  
Desperate with no sense of value,  
Just an evil mind lurking through the night.  
  
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking,  
Cause you're feeling so up-tight.

Jack Frost nipping at your nose,  
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir,  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright.  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
They know that Santa's on his way,  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.  
And every mother's child will want to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
For kids from one to ninety-two,  
Although it's been said many times, many ways,  
Merry Christmas to you.  
They know that Santa's on his way

Yesterday I stared out at the water, lawn chair in the sand all day  
And as the sun kissed the horizon and the day began to fade  
And people got into their cars and drove the fuck away  
And the sounds of modern industry drifted lazily into space  
But the fish are still dead in the water

And the indians never saw a dime

Am I mad?  
Is that all?  
Does he miss me?  
Was he suddenly  
Getting bored with me?  
  
Wake up! Stop dreaming.  
Stop prancing about the woods.  
It's not besseming.  
What is it about the woods?  
  
Back to life, back to sense,  
Back to child, back to husband,

There are vows, there are ties,  
There are needs, there are standards,  
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds.

Have a child for warmth,  
And a Baker for bread,  
And a Prince for whatever-  
Never!

Join the group, stop the Giant-  
Just get out of these woods.

Was that me? No it wasn't,  
Just a trick of the woods.  
  
Just a moment,  
One peculiar passing moment...  
Must it all be either less or more,  
Either plain or grand?  
Is it always ""or""?  
Is it never ""and""?  
That's what woods are for:  
For those moments in the woods...  
  
Oh. if life were made of moments,  
Even now and then a bad one-!  
But if life were only moments,  
Then you'd never know you had one.  
  
First a Witch, then a child,  
Then a Prince, then a moment-  
Who can live in the woods?  
And to get what you wish,  
Only just for a moment-  
These are dangerous woods...  
  
Let the moment go...  
Don't forget it for a moment, though.  
Just remembering you've had and ""and"",  
When you're back to ""or"",  
Makes the ""or"" mean more  
Than it did before.  
Now I understand-  
  
And it's time to leave the woods.

Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down  
To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids  
Now watchin' mamma cry  
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything  
Life has a funny way of going in a ring,  
End up growing up in trouble with the law  
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore  
Now it seems that every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation  
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation  
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)

And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears,
innovation

Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield  
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,  
Watch it wash away  
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away  
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm  
Over half a million people die  
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized  
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes

Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did  
Before you turn a positive to a negative  
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck you're dealing with  
This is not a dress rehearsal, let me tell you kid  
Whatever you put out there is coming back again  
Years may burn (ohh)  
Tables gonna turn  
Karma's coming back around  
Either way you're gonna learn

As the day you were taken away  
  
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day  
Right now, I wish I could hear you say  
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch  
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must  
  
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me  
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it  
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom  
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son  
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out  
So if you get a second to look down on me now  
  
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
Oh, oh  
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?  
Would you love me a loser or winner?  
Oh, oh  
When I see my face in the mirror  
We look so alike that it makes me shiver  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now

People talk about the guy  
Who's waiting on a girl  
  
There are no holes in his shoes  
But a big hole in his world  
  
And maybe I'll get famous as man who can't be moved,  
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,  
And you'll come running to the corner  
'Cause you'll know it's just for you  
  
I'm the man who can't be moved  
I'm the man who can't be moved  
  
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,  
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet,  
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.  
  
So I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
Going back to the corner where I first saw you,  
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag not I'm not gonna move.

I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her, by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
But now I've broken away  
Somehow instead she forgave me  
She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do  
Even if it means she denied herself the truth  
'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late,  
You've fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me

Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
  
She's standing in the heart of darkness  
Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless  
How could any woman in their right mind be so blind,  
To find something this safe  
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away  
  
She finds color in the darkest places  
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces  
For such a clued in, headstrong city girl  
Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay

She was young and she was forced to be a woman  
Yeah, all the time, all the time  
  
[Bridge]  
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting  
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone  
  
[Hook]  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
  
I don't think you understand...  
  
[Hook]

She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
