Deep Purple,Paint It Black,/d/deep+purple/paint+it+black_20294175.html,"I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,  
With flowers and my love, both never to come back.  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,  
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day.  
  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black,  
I see my red door and I want it painted black.  
  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,  
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.  
  
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,  
I could not forsee this thing happening to you.  
  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun,  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.  
  
I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I want to see your face painted black, black as night.  
Don't want to see the sun flyin' high in the sky.  
I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!

Deep Purple,Painted Horse,/d/deep+purple/painted+horse_20038864.html,"Child on a painted horse  
Streams that will run their course  
Gone to a far away shore  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Days of another kind  
Frost gets a bruising vine  
Why did the carpenter die  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Sweet as a rose so fine  
Peaceful as a final time  
How old could the lion man cry  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Thoughts of a winter moon  
Warm in a distant room  
Why did I fall asleep so soon  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping

Deep Purple,Perfect Strangers,/d/deep+purple/perfect+strangers_20038780.html,"Can you remember remember my name  
As I flow through your life  
A thousand oceans I have flown  
And cold spirits of ice  
All my life  
I am the echo of your past  
  
I am returning the echo of a point in time  
Distant faces shine  
A thousand warriors I have known  
And laughing as the spirits appear  
All your life  
Shadows of another day  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
  
A strand of silver hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Is aching with the dead of the night  
Precious life (your tears are lost in  
Falling rain)  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers

Deep Purple,Second Movement: Andante,/d/deep+purple/second+movement+andante_20038865.html,"How can I see when the light is gone out?  
How can I hear when you speak so silently?  
More than enough is never too much  
Hold out a hand I'm so out of touch  
  
Do unto me as your heart would have you do  
Words in my head can I get the message through?  
Sword in my hand can cut through the wood  
Peace in my heart can soften the mood  
  
What shall I do when they stand smiling at me?  
Look at the floor and be oh, so cool  
Oh, so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to start singing my song?  
What shall I do if they all go wrong?  
What shall I do?  
  
What shall I do when they stand laughing at me?  
Walk through the door and be oh so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to stop singing my song?  
What shall I do when it all goes wrong?

Deep Purple,Shield,/d/deep+purple/shield_20038847.html,"Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While the children play in the field  
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life  
But how strong is the shield?  
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground  
Where sky is forever blue  
  
So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud  
Which may take me from you  
  
Many things a man can lose  
His self, his rights, his views  
But never his heart or his love  
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb  
To the hill up above  
  
Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While our children play in the field  
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life  
And trust in the strength of the shield  
  
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above  
And let light pass like a wheel  
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have it's word, of course  
(Think this line is wrong)  
And time will change its course  
And hold the strength of the shield

Come lay with me and love me  
And I would surely stay  
  
But I feel I'm growing older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
Many times I've been a traveler  
I looked for something new  
In days of old when nights were cold  
I wandered without you  
But those days I thought my eyes  
Had seen you standing near  
Though blindness is confusing  
It shows that you're not here.  
  
Now I feel I'm going older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round

Everybody loved her  
She loved everyone and gave them good return  
I tried to take her  
I even tried to break her  
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn

But things got better, she said  
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star  
  
She finally said she loved me  
I wed her in a hurry  
No more callers and I glowed with pride  
I'm dreaming  
I feel like screaming  
I won my woman just before she died

Get some decent clothes  
The only way to make it  
Dress the part'

I've been bitten once  
But I won't be shy twice  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
It's Russian roulette  
With every roll of your dice  
  
And nine lives is all we're gonna get?  
I said all we're gonna get yeah?  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
You've just bitten less than your nine lives.

They're always calling on my telephone  
When I pick it up there's no one there  
So I walk outside just to take the air  
  
Come on with me cruising down the street  
Who knows what you'll see, who you might meet  
This brave new world's not like yesterday  
It can take you higher than the milky way  
  
Now I'm blinded I can't really see, yeah  
No more bright lights confusing me, no  
Don't ask me why I'm feeling blue  
Cause loving you is all I can do  
  
Hey good-looking boys, gather around  
The sidewalk papers gutter-press you down  
All those lies can be so unkind,  
They can make you feel like you're losing your mind  
  
Street life  
Street life  
Street life  
What a life  
  
Back to nature boys, Vasser girls too  
Watch what you say, or think, or do  
Continental-style strasse girls might  
But you know exactly if it's wrong or right  
  
Education is an important key, yes  
But the good life's never won by degrees, no  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale  
Only window shopping, it's strictly no sale  
  
Week end starts Friday soon after eight  
Your jet black magic helps you celebrate  
You may be stranded if you stick around  
And that's really something

How do I know he loves me  
How do I know he's mine  
Well does he leave you a little note to tell you  
You are on his mind  
Does he send you  
Yellow flowers when the sky is gray yeah  
He'll find a new way to show you a little  
Bit everyday  
That's how you know that's how you know he's your love  
Everybody wants to live happily ever after  
Everybody wants to know that true love is true  
How do you know he loves you how do you know he's yours  
Does he take you out dancing just  
So he can hold you close  
Dedicate a song with words meant just for you  
He'll find a new way to show you with the little things he'll do  
That's how you know that's how you know he's you love  
He's you love  
That's haow you know  
How do you know  
How does she know that you love her  
How do you show her you love her  
How does she know that you really really truly love her  
That's how you know  
Because he'll wear your favorite color just so he canmatch your eyes  
Rent a private pinic by the fire glow oh oh  
His heart will be yours forever something everyday will show

This situation just for  
The sake of your need for attention  
And I'm sick of always being the one

Open their hearts to the fun

The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel

As I sit  
At this empty cafe  
Thinking of you  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
Though the world  
Is my oyster  
It's only a shell  
Full of memories  
Here by the Seine  
Notre-Dame casts  
A long lonely shadow  
Now only sorrow  
No tomorrow  
There's no today for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterday  
This is my song  
This is my song  
This is my song  
These cities may change  
But there always remains  
My obsession  
Through silken waters  
My gondola glides  
And the bridge  
it sighs  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
There's no more time for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterdays  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again

You'll find love has been wrecked  
By both sides compromising  
Amounting to a disastrous effect  
  
You hear stories of old  
Of princes bold  
With riches untold  
Happy souls  
Casting it all aside  
To take some bride  
To have the girl of their dreams  
At their side  
But not me  
I couldn't do that  
Not me  
I'm not like that  
  
I couldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
I really like you  
I'm attracted to you  
The way you move  
The things you do  
I'll probably burn in hell  
For saying this  
But I'm really in heaven  
Whenever we kiss  
But Oh no!  
You won't change me  
You can try  
For an eternity  
  
I wouldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all

You have too  
And I've got to be me  
You've got to be you  
So take my hand  
And feel these lips  
And let's savour a kiss  
Like we'd savour a sip  
Of vintage wine  
One more time  
Let's surrender  
To this love divine

Anywhere you run to

Who wants to be like a sea without a shore  
The love just drifting forever more  
Every smile has a frown  
All you gotta do is turn it upside down  
Every house has a door  
Of that I'm sure  
  
So if everything is made up of two  
I think it would be best if you know  
For my other half  
I'll settle for you  
Don't you know, I'll settle for you  
I'll settle for you  
If I had to settle, baby  
I'll settle for you  
Don't you know, I'll settle for you

Nothing to kill or die for  
And no religion too

Imagine all possessions  
I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger  
A brotherhood of man

I long to find a love, I'm sure about  
Well, that certain kind of love that moves all doubts  
  
Keep falling in and out of love  
Still searchin' for that special one  
To whom I can give my love completely  
And feel a lasting love, so sweetly  
  
Just when I feel sure, love's here to stay  
It seems to suddenly, just fade away  
I can't seem to find that everlasting love  
That this heart of mine needs so much of  
  
Keep falling in and out of love  
I can't seem to find the lasting kind  
It seems, I can't find the joy I need  
Love always somehow, all goes wrong for me  
  
Keep falling in and out of love  
Keep falling in and out of love  
I keep reaching out for tenderness  
Touching a hand that holds emptiness  
  
Well, I'm looking for my love that lingers on  
Long after that first kiss is gone  
That kind of love that keeps burning bright  
Long after we've said goodnight  
  
Keep falling in and out of love  
In search for what I'm dreaming of  
Keep falling in and out of love

Of a tender love that used to be

Reminding me how in love we used to be  
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart  
Saying together forever, breaking up never

Every time I hear our favorite song  
Now you're gone, left this emptiness  
I only reminisce the happiness we spent  
We used to dance to the music  
Make romance through the music

It's been six months, maybe better  
I try forgetting him  
But I love him more then ever  
  
I have decided  
I've waited long enough  
If there was nothing wrong  
He would return right on that bus  
  
There must be trouble  
So I'm leavin' on the double  
If he can't get to me

Dire Straits,Industrial Disease,/d/dire+straits/industrial+disease_20040724.html,"Now warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control  
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw it in a hole  
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town  
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell  
There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
'Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most  
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas  
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease  
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse  
History boils over there's an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'  
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here  
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer  
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis ease  
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'  
  
He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed  
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest  
Come back and see me later - next patient please  
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'  
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck  
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks  
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong  
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says  
They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?

The rank and file and the navy blue  
The deep and strong, the straight and true  
  
The blue line they got the given sign  
The belts and boots march forward in time  
The wood and leather the club and shield  
Swept like a wave across the battlefield  
  
Now with all the clarity of dream  
The blood so red, the grass so green  
The gleam of spur on chestnut flank  
The cavalry did burst upon the ranks  
  
Oh the iron will and iron hand  
In England's green and pleasant land  
No music for the shameful scene  
That night they said it had even shocked the queen

Knights in armor, days of yore  
The same old feasance and the same old crimes

Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals  
A girl is there high heeling across the square  
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles  
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light  
She looks around to find a face she can like  
  
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong  
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays  
They're all in the station praying for trains  
Congregation late again  
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days  
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright  
He's crazy lion howling for a fight  
  
Strap hanging gunshot sound  
Doors slamming on the overground  
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone  
Her evening paper is horror torn  
But there's hope later for Capricorns  
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home  
Then she's reading about a swing to the right  
But she's thinking about a stranger in the night  
I'm thinking about the lions tonight  
What happened to the lions

Your injured looks  
The sacred and profane  
The pleasure and the pain  
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A ladykiller, regulation tattoo  
Silver spurs on his heels  
Says, what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you  
She threw herself under my wheels  
Oh it's a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A three-chord symphony crashes into space  
The moon is hanging upside down  
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case  
It's a ravenous town  
And you still refuse to be traced  
Seems to me such a waste  
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me

Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away

For the sweet essence of your love  
Oh I know this love was meant to be,  
You are the biggest part of me  
Deeper than the deepest ocean  
Oh I take the pride in knowing  
That I got you by my side  
Ever waiting, ever standing by  
  
Chorus:  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I can't deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside  
  
Verse 3:  
Not an hour out of the million days  
Could you ever take your sweet love away  
Not a one day out of the million years  
Could I ever live without you here  
Inside everyday I thank the lord above  
For the sweetness of your love  
Kindness of your love  
Patience of you love  
One and only lover  
Never be another  
  
Chorus:  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I can't deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside

Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  
  
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers

Ain't nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill

And so we headed out to find our promised land  
Just poor Appalachian farm folk  
With nothing more than high hopes  
We hitched our station wagon to a star  
But our dreams all fell in on us  
'Cause there was no land of promise  
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern heart is weary  
I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus

Appalachian memories keep me strong

About what's been and what awaits me  
It takes all I've got to give what life demands  
You go insane if you give in to it  
Life's a mill and I've been through it

Joseph wore and then she said  
I hope this coat will bring you  
Good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And momma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colors  
That my momma made for me  
Made only from rags  
But I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
So with patches on my britches  
And holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
And my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
And oh I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love  
My momma sewed in every stitch  
And I told 'em all the story  
Momma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor  
Only if they choose to be  
Now I know we had no money  
But I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
Made just for me

I washed my face and read the names  
In the walkway of the stars

To help me get on record

And when it's family, you trust them  
And your heart's an open door  
When it's family, you tolerate  
What you'd kill others for  
When it's family, you love and hate  
And take then give some more  
Somehow you justify mistakes  
Try to find some better way  
To solve the problems day to day  
In the family  
  
You take the trouble as it comes  
And love 'em more than anyone  
Good or bad or indifferent  
It's still family  
You choose your lovers  
You pick your friends  
Not the family that you're in  
They'll be with you 'til the end  
'Cause it's family  
  
When it's family, you forgive them  
For they know not what they do  
When it's family, they're a mirror  
Of the worst and best in you  
When it's family, when it's family  
Let me be all that I should be  
To the family

You must know how I feel  
But do you feel the same  
Everytime you kiss me  
You add fuel to the flame  
  
My eyes light up when I see you  
I burn with desire  
Each time you're near  
You say you'll care  
But still I'm not sure  
But please don't ask me to love you  
If you're not gonna change my name  
  
Everytime you touch me  
You add fuel to the flame  
This fire you started inside me  
Has reached my very soul  
You're adding fuel to a flame  
That's already burning out of control  
When you give me your name  
I give you everything  
Everytime you kiss me  
Adds fuel to the flame  
Yes everytime you touch me

Dolly Parton,Gamble Either Way,/d/dolly+parton/gamble+either+way_20041833.html,"Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made  
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face  
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst  
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt  
'Cause I was raised an orphan  
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13  
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth  
Men just took me as they pleased  
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress  
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck  
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time  
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind  
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides  
But sometimes when you're riding free  
You'll pay the highest price  
On back roads and in back seats  
And in a cheap highway motel  
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light  
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night  
When I walked into the parlour here  
Other pieces seemed to fit  
I was good at pleasing strangers  
So I made the most of it  
  
Either way it's all a gamble  
So view the stakes and know the odds  
And lay your cards upon the table  
Do all the dealing from the top  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way

And I just might make it work  
I just might make it after all  
I just might rise above the hurt  
Thought I've suffered quite a fall  
But I have to get a grip  
And hold on to it like a vice  
Have to face the falling chips  
I just might make it, I just might  
  
Oh, I might have been a fool  
But its true that love is blind  
And you have broken every rule  
You've taken all that yours and mine  
And how does one go on with life?  
When your shattered so inside  
Pieces of a love gone wrong  
Well, ya pick 'em up and you move along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know  
Well, I might even be surprised  
I've got to get on with my life  
I just might make it  
I just might  
  
Nothin' left to do but try  
I might make it  
I just might

I pick up the phone before it ever rings  
And when you need some lovin'  
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything  
Oh, it's like I always said  
You're the one I want  
All I want is you

And all she wants to do is dance, dance

In the local disco lounge  
All she wants to do is dance, dance  
To keep the boys from selling  
All the weapons they can scrounge  
All she wants to do is dance

From making a buck or two  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

All the drugs that they can do

For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout, they said:  
""Don't come back here, Yankee.""  
But if I ever do, I'll bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance

Coming off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down

Summarily rejected

While you are looking the other way

They know your mother's maiden name

Some shaky modern saviors  
Have now been resurrected  
In all this excitement  
You may have been misled  
  
People want a miracle  
They say Oh Lord, can't you see us?  
We're tryin' to make a livin' down here  
And keep the children fed  
But, from little dark motel rooms  
To Six Flags over Jesus  
How are the mighty fallen

You don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees  
For a little tin god  
  
The cowboy's name was Jingo  
And he heard that there was trouble  
So in a blaze of glory  
He rode out of the west  
No one was ever certain  
What it was that he was sayin'  
But they loved it when he told them  
They were better than the rest  
  
But you don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might hate the system, hate the job  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees  
For a little tin god  
  
Throw down a rope from heaven  
And lead the flock to water  
The man in the middle would have you think  
That you have no other choice  
But to wander in the wilderness  
Of all the upturned faces  
If you stop and listen long enough  
You will hear your own small voice  
  
But you don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees

Past the fireflies that float  
To an angel bending down  
To wrap you in his warmest coat

Still you angle for your case

Might build a bridge that lasts

Devoid of all romance  
The music plays and everyone must dance  
I'm bowing out, I need a second chance  
  
Save me from all the trouble and the pain  
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again  
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain  
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain  
  
And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you  
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air  
I've got a dream I want the world to share in castle walls  
Just leave me to despair

Don McLean,Chain Lightning,/d/don+mclean/chain+lightning_20166596.html,"Sometimes when I'm thinkin' that love's not around  
My heart begins sinkin', I don't hear a sound  
And the world is in blackness, no light shines on me  
I suffer no blindness, no one can I see  
Then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire  
And the silence is broken, and the night is on fire.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel.  
Who know's where it strikes or when it will hit,  
How long it will last, or when it will quit.  
  
In the forest I'm burning, struck down by the blast  
The fever is churning, and the heat rises fast.  
And those standing nearest can show their concern  
But I swear if they touch me that they too will burn.  
They fear for their lives for death will soon dwell  
In the warmth of your love is the fire of hell.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame  
And love will soon shatter what it cannot tame  
And the cycle continues, from life into dust  
For I am now in you with the fire of lust.  
And I hear the explosion, of thunder and rain,  
The water is falling, the ashes remain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Indian's tell us that the Phoenix can rise  
From the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes  
And watch beautiful colours from black and from grey  
Be formed into wings and take me away  
Where evil is darkness and goodness is light  
And love is the lightning that cuts through the night  
And strikes only once in a dark place in time  
And forms a gold stairway that all of us climb.

Don McLean,Circus Song,/d/don+mclean/circus+song_20175087.html,"Cotton candy, two for a quarter  
See if the fat man can guess your weight  
A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her  
And I'm going home 'cause it's late  
  
Roller coasters make me dizzy  
And cotton candy makes me sick  
I wish I had some Bromo fizzy  
Now that would do the trick  
  
Everyone knows that the clowns aren't happy  
And everyone knows that the people don't care  
I wish I could laugh at the way that they're acting  
But I'm so sick, I just don't dare to  
  
High wire dancers kick and balance  
White silk horses step in time  
The tattooed man displays his talents  
I'm not the talented kind  
  
I always go to the circus on Sunday  
And there I can laugh at the people I see  
But when I leave home in the morning on Monday  
Everybody laughs at me  
  
I make other people nervous  
I guess that's why they laugh at me  
But to me my life is a three-ring circus  
And I can see it for free  
  
Have you seen my wife Elvira?  
She can tame a lion, you know  
Well, I once had a bushy mane  
But that was so damn long ago  
  
Tight-collared clowns in plastic buildings  
Have happy families as their fate  
Happy jobs and happy clubs  
And happy people they hate  
  
Everyone's juggling and everyone's acting  
With smiles of grease paint three feet wide  
Everyone's caught on a carousel pony  
And one time around is a lifetime ride

And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell  
  
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you  
Then you said ""so long"" left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying  
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand  
Can start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do  
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Just a plain and simple chapel  
Where humble people go to pray  
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger  
As I live from day to day  
  
I've searched and I've searched  
But I couldn't find  
No way on earth  
To gain peace of mind  
  
Now I'm happy in the chapel  
Where people are of one accord  
We gather in the chapel  
Just to sing and praise the Lord  
  
Ev'ry sinner looks for something  
That will put his heart at ease  
There is only one true answer  
He must get down on his knees  
  
Meet your neighbor in the chapel  
Join with him in tears of joy  
You'll know the meaning of contentment  
Then you'll be happy with the Lord  
  
You'll search and you'll search  
But you'll never find  
No way on earth  
To gain peace of mind  
  
Take your troubles to the chapel  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Your burdens will be lighter  
And you'll surely find the way

And here with scars of now and then so you and I begin again.

Don McLean,Falling Through Time,/d/don+mclean/falling+through+time_20195371.html,"I can't answer the questions you ask me,  
I don't know what to say.  
The answers are somewhere lost in the stars  
when the night has turned to day.  
But I know if the silence of night could be here,  
It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear  
And I could reach out and draw you so near to me  
  
Touch me and warm me and I will lie still.  
And all that you ask me to give you I will  
One living moment we'll have for our own.  
A brief flash of time that we spent all alone.  
But you ask me for nothing and give what you can  
And we're wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again  
And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one  
  
Closely we're falling through time  
And the earth will turn in the silence of space,  
always in motion yet always in place  
And all things will change yet remain what they are.  
And far will be near and near will be far  
And the ages will darken and blend into time  
And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme  
But our moment together is forever sublime  
  
For the time has arrived when we must understand  
That we're lost in a void on this sad speck of sand  
And nobody knows where we are, no one cares  
And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares  
And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame  
Have forgotten that no one remembers their name  
But time and the universe are always the same  
  
Closely we're falling through time

Give me fifty shotgun shells

Just add that to my bill  
  
Says here there ain't no hope  
They all were burned alive  
And four packs of cigarettes

She'll learn this life ain't easy  
You do the best you can  
  
No, no, my family ain't so good  
My wife just had a spell  
And I can't afford the medicine  
She needs to make her well

For sixteen months or more  
I came home last Wednesday evenin'  
I found her lyin' on the floor

Say howdy to your son  
You can tell him we'll go huntin'

Don McLean,Genesis (In The Beginning),/d/don+mclean/genesis+in+the+beginning_20206465.html,"In the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand  
And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land  
And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new  
And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew  
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their [Do7]kind  
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind.  
  
[Chorus:]  
We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne  
Of the kingdom God made for our winning.  
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone  
Have so little time left for beginning.  
  
And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life  
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife  
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea  
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony  
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land  
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.  
  
(Chorus)  
And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall.  
The drop of blood became a man, the tree of life grew tall.  
And perfect in his loneliness, a rib pulled from his chest  
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.  
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat.  
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.  
  
(Chorus)  
Tree of knowledge, tree of death, upon the ground they trod.  
The serpent said your eye's will see and ye will be a god.  
Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die  
And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky.  
And man was banished east of Eden. See what we have lost.  
For though the father sets the price, the children pay the cost.

Standin' on a dark street, there's a light in the sky.

How can I avoid infinity? How have I annoyed infinity?  
I'm movin' slow in infinity. I even glow in infinity.

How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?

Give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed.  
Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity.  
I hope I can contribute, oh, but I don't want a tribute.  
Hypocrites will come and say somethin' really dumb in infinity.  
I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.  
The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity.

As far as the planets in space.  
As galaxy's mysteries start to unwind  
Some changes are bound to take place.

My mission is close to adrift  
Though I can be strong when my power unravels

Donna Summer,I Don't Wanna Work,/d/donna+summer/i+dont+wanna+work_10087984.html,"Well I give it little care  
Does anybody out there even know  
I'm in here?  
I just keep my movement going  
Somewhere  
Like playing in the background baby  
Like playing in the background baby  
  
I play the game  
You play the way that most men would choose  
I'm surprised at you  
Way back in the middle of a broken down love affair  
You and I found each other  
And we fell in love  
I ain't never met a man and woman get along better  
Than you and I when get together  
Still I say  
I don't wanna work that hard  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no  
  
See the lady walking down the street  
She's got on high heel shoes  
And her hair full of curlers  
She's got stiletto nails  
And some black mascara  
She's got a push up and a pick up  
I tell you that girl's working overtime  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no no no no no  
I don't wanna work  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work it if makes me cry  
  
Spent last night  
Talking to myself in bed  
Wondering why I do this over  
Over and over again  
I don't know  
I, I, I, I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not when it makes me cry  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work not that hard

Early Sunday morning around breakfast time  
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door  
Oh and there was more  
Well it was you I saw  
No mistake  
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face  
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes  
Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Let it all hang out

From jazz and cocktails

Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again

Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too

Stayed away from love  
Afraid of what might  
Might happen  
Till I thought  
I heard a sound above  
Singing through my very  
Own heart  
Was a melody  
I never heard  
Like birds singing loud  
To the sky  
  
Never dreamed that  
True love would help me  
Find my way  
Didn't know how deep I'd fallen  
Until you rescued, rescued me  
Suddenly  
Strings began  
I heard the melody again and again  
The sound of music  
Flowing through my head  
So rare  
I'm walking on air  
  
Melody of love  
Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing

Burning ever since yeah

Donna Summer,Mimi's Song,/d/donna+summer/mimis+song_20042299.html,"Spoken:  
You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight  
""Goodnight""

And maybe some of you men too

Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word

You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all  
(I got it bad and that ain't good)  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love

Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible

Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

The boss man's whip is all he's got to give  
And late at night in the twilight of the South  
They put you in a cell and let the bulldogs out  
The old cat down the way  
Well he's singin' out the blues  
'Cause he's got no one back home  
Oh, somebody sighed  
Next day comes they send you back out on the track  
All that sweat be drippin' down off your back  
Everybody's singin' a workin' man's song  
Hopin' they don't have to feel the whip on their bone  
The water boy slowly works his way around  
A bucket full of swamp water weighin' him down  
Old Squezer Walker just fell out on the ground  
And they're draggin' his body away

Well, there's talk around camp  
That there's gonna be a fight  
Old Razor Face and Willie Black  
The meanest dudes in sight  
One's got a razor and the other's got a knife  
But only one's gonna walk out alive  
  
Oh, baby, mama, get me out of here  
Can't stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me

Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games  
Handsome lad, dead in a car  
Confusion  
No connections  
Come 'ere  
I love you  
Peace on earth  
Will you die for me?  
Eat me  
This way  
The end  
I'll always be true  
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe  
If you'll only show me Far Arden again.  
I'm surprised you could get it up  
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt  
Haven't I been through enough? she asks  
Now dressed and leaving  
The Spanish girl begins to bleed  
She says her period  
It's Catholic heaven  
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck  
My chest is hard and brown  
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin  
We could plan a murder  
Or start a religion.

She's a wizard, she's a champ  
And she doesn't need a lamp

The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well  
With the magic of a broom  
She can mesmerize a room  
  
With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there  
And a dustpan for the cinders  
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there  
She can polish up the winders  
  
Then presto chango  
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through  
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?  
How d'you do?  
  
It makes you blink, to stop and think  
A woman and a whisk-broom  
Can accomplish so darn much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch  
  
A woman's touch can quickly fill  
The empty flower boxes on a window sill  
One smile from her and zoom  
Little buds begin to bloom  
  
A touch of paint, a magic nail  
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale  
Even make the lamp appear  
Like a crystal chandelier  
  
With a tack tack here and a tack tack there  
And a hand around a hammer  
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there  
You can give a cabin glamour  
  
Then gosh, almighty, all at once  
The cabin that we knew  
Becomes a shining castle built for two  
Me and you  
  
The pies and cakes a woman bakes  
Can make a fella tell her  
That he loves her very much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,  
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,  
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,  
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,  
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,  
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,  
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,  
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,  
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it

And you don't even have to ask twice,  
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice  
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life  
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life  
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on  
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong  
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along  
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home

And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister  
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue  
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial  
She call me the referee cause I be so official  
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle  
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,  
And who told you to put them jeans on  
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on  
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on  
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot  
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot  
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop  
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know  
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside  
So I don?t ever question you and damn  
I can't even find, the perfect brush  
So I can paint what's going through my mind  
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind

You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

[Lil wayne]  
So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air, so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew  
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you  
I flew jet, she flew commercial  
But we still met, later that night  
After my session, she came over  
I was aggressive, and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did, but that was last month  
And now she's texting me, asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon' catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit, sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasn't married  
Promises, I hope I never break 'em  
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
[Bridge:]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?  
  
[Hook:]  
(And I say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Damn right, all right

Fuckin' right, all right

Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,

Cause this baby is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me!  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key...

All-star weekend and she's been voted my favorite starter.  
... On the back of a jersey, so you won't forget it,  
But she shines bright, blind them light  
So that... Forget it.  
Just one life to live, the kind of life I will...  
And if I don't see her tonight, the rest of my life I will regret it!

But you know how much I wanted to make it, It's probably better anyhow  
So if you gotta go, if there's anything I should know  
If the spotlight makes you nervous  
If you're looking for a purpose  
You put the tea in the kettle and light it  
Put your hand on the metal and feel it  
But do you even feel it anymore?  
I remember when you thought I was joking  
Now I'm off singing karaoke  
Farther than I've ever been  
So if you gotta go, if there's any way I can help  
  
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner?  
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta? Damn  
Of all the places you could go  
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know  
I'm always up too late, I worry about you there alone  
And that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron  
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy  
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady  
I know they say the first love is the sweetest  
But that first cut is the deepest  
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets  
You were telling everybody but me  
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky  
I'm surprised you couldn't tell  
  
I was only trying to get ahead

They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you  
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true  
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying  
I'm just here making all the music that they party to

I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga  
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot

Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose  
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target  
But a target nonetheless and I just started  
Was that directed at moi? Can't be

Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner

A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub  
I just landed in that G450  
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy

The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk

Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl

Why you want to fight for your right

Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in

And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say

Why you never come to where I stay?  
Always hiding out in your New York condo  
Why you never come to where I stay?  
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense  
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?  
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?  
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man  
Aw man, aw man  
Aw, man  
  
[Verse]  
Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch  
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up  
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If I'm working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous  
I empower girls that don't deserve it  
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose  
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6  
  
[Hook 2]  
You don't ever come to where I stay  
You just rather stay up in your New York condo  
You don't ever come to where I stay  
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
You know how sticky these situation get  
You go up higher than me some days  
You know what I think we could be some day

Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez ""Damn Drake fly""  
And he just be like ""Silly mother fucker I know""  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me

Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand

Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know

I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Drake,Stunt Hard,/d/drake/stunt+hard_20607367.html,"[Chorus]  
I did it all on my own,  
Turned a chair to a throne,  
I'm a king in this world,  
(Stunt hard)  
I put my whole city on,  
To some things that they never would've known,  
If I didn't,  
(Stunt hard)  
And every night is a premiere,  
If I ever disappear,  
Best believe I'm comin' back.  
(Stunt hard)  
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,  
On that same shit again,  
All I ever do is,  
(Stunt hard)  
  
(Drake):  
I tell her.  
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who Is He"",  
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall,  
Sittin' this tall.  
I float high,  
Goodbye,  
I will miss y'all.

(Lil' Wayne):  
If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.  
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.  
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.  
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.  
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.  
I'm a young rebel.  
And I got a baby face.  
I need a young pebbles.  
I need a stuntdouble.  
Yeah!  
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.  
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.  
Yeah!  
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.  
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.  
Yeah!  
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes  
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.  
Yeah!  
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.  
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.  
Yeah!  
I'm on the cup of that tilt.  
And if you hatin' on me  
I'll say fuck you like wilt.  
Yeah!  
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.  
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace.  
Yeah!  
Talkin' big big shit.  
I am rude,  
I take food,  
From a kid picnic.  
Nigga.

And we can bang like bumper cars.  
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all stunner bars.  
Haha.

I stunt hard. I stunt harder.  
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.  
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.  
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.  
I hustle harder.  
I live in the Carter.  
I think forward,  
All I see is tomorrow.  
I need me.  
I'll turn your shop into a horror.  
So if you trying to see more  
Better feed me.  
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.  
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur.  
And the feds will never get me,  
Like a backwards,  
Password,  
Black spur,  
Go some like Pacman, cats first.  
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister  
Ask her,  
Am I their man,  
Her answer,

Childish as it seems it'll make it all better... Better  
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you no...

I've asked about you and they've told me things  
But my mind didn't change  
I still the feel the same  
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know  
We know, they don't get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste  
Pushing me away so I give her space  
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break  
I'll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thanking you, just don't know  
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that  
On your face girl, it just don't show  
When you're ready, just say you're ready  
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy  
And the parties over, just don't forget me  
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won't ever have to worry,  
You won't ever have to hide  
And you seen all my mistakes  
So look me in my eyes

It's my birthday, I get high if I want to  
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to  
Cause you don't say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself

But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?  
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.  
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.  
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.  
I am, still here with who I started with.  
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.  
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.  
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.  
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.  
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,  
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.  
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.  
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.  
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.  
I'm trying to do better than good enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.  
But people I don't have the time to hang with,  
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)  
You promised me you would never change.  
You promised me you would never change.  
  
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.  
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.  
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.  
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.  
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,  
That I barley know at all and,  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.  
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.  
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,  
I'm holding on by a thread it's,  
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,  
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.  
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.  
Which made me question when I went missing.  
And when I start treating my friends different.  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.  
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.  
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.  
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.  
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.  
Did I just trade free time for camera time?  
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?  
I just need some closure.  
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason

When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel

For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first

Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.

So I'm single thinking about what we had and missing you

And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out, its Drizzy  
Always gone but never hard to find  
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind  
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave  
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save  
But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle  
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now  
Never forgetting from where I came  
And no matter where I'm headed  
I promise to stay the same (yeah, look)  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around  
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters  
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

Damn right, so fly I need feathers  
Sayin' shit in the streets so whats the dilly

I swear that every car that passes has you in it  
I can't believe we're finished  
My life is movin' fast  
The time will often pass  
And something will remind me  
I can't put this behind me  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could've had my all by now, by now  
It's been too many years for you to disappear  
And have me asking the question  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you

I swear I heard you call  
But when I heard you'd gone  
I hate that I looked desperate  
You gone is like me naked  
I'm staring at your (?)  
Trying to make it last  
Keep looking close behind me  
My eyesight on a memory  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could have all my love right now, by now  
Gave into my fears  
While you just disappeared  
That's why I'm asking this question...

I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 3: drake]  
I can't go to bed  
Thinking about my goals  
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline  
Where did the other half of my heart go?  
Why am I in bed alone?  
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?  
Do you even live there?  
Or did you take a u-haul?  
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?  
We were on fire  
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out  
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try

Well, isn't it for the honor of god,  
Aunt Kate?  
I know all about the honor of god,

Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream  
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop  
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep  
And wood to chop before he sleeps  
  
I may never get over  
But never's better than now  
I've got bases to cover  
  
He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car  
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out  
He lights a cigarette  
And turns the music down  
But just can't seem to shake that sound  
  
Once I thought I'd get over  
But it's too late for me now  
I've got bases to cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
'til they finally let it all go  
  
The pain inside  
Coming outside  
  
So many ways to drown a man  
So many ways to drag him down  
Some are fast and some take years and years  
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep  
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep  
  
I could never get over  
Is it too late for me now?  
Feel like blowing my cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
'til they finally let it all go  
  
But don't cut your losses too soon  
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat  
And answer a call while you still hear at all  
'cause nobody will if you won't

I'll never be the same.  
What began as laughter  
So soon would turn to pain.  
  
The sky was clear and frigid  
The air was thick and still  
Now I'm not one to soon forget  
And I bet I never will  
  
Picture for a moment  
The perfect irony  
A flawless new beginning  
Eclipsed by tragedy.  
  
The uninvited stranger  
Started dancing on his own  
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride  
And we made our way back home.  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
Father and mother  
Holding each other.  
(Chug chug chug chug)  
  
Without warning  
Out of nowhere  
Like a bullet  
From the night  
  
Crushing glass  
Rubber and steel  
Scorching fire  
Glowing lights  
  
Screams of terror  
Pain of fear  
Sounds of sirens  
Smoke in my eyes  
  
Sudden stillness  
Wrapped in silence  
No more screaming  
No more cries  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Lying on the table  
In this unfamiliar place  
I'm greeted by a stranger  
A man without a face  
  
He said, ""Son do you remember?  
Do you even know your name?""  
Then he shined a light into my eyes  
And said, ""take this for the pain.""  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
""Tell me does this hurt you?""  
Said the faceless man.  
""Can you move all of your fingers?  
Can you try your best to stand?""  
  
I asked about the others  
""Is everyone okay?""  
He told me not to worry  
As he turned and looked away.  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
Day after day  
And night after night  
We burden the oppressed  
Did they ever see the red light?  
  
Over and over  
Scene by scene  
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.  
How could you prepare  
  
For what would happen next?  
The search you'll never have to see  
Hi father such a mess.  
It's a miracle he lived  
  
It's a blessing no one died  
By the grace of God above  
Everyone survived  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
It will stay with us forever  
A nightmare to remember

But prepare for the end

But time just slipped away

Life goes by in the blink of an eye

Thank you for the smiles

Chapters unfinished, fading  
  
Closer now,  
Slowly coming into view  
I've arrived,  
Blinding sunshine beaming through

Familiar settings, nothing new  
There's a pathway leading there  
With a haunting chill in the air  
  
There's room at the top of the stairs  
Every night I'm drawn up there

Behinde the disguise

Haunting me everyday  
I'd break through the other side  
If only I'd find the way  
  
Something's awfully familiar  
The feeling's so hard to shake  
Could I have lived in that other world  
It's a link that I'm destined to make

Face yourself man!

You've been  
Blinded,  
Living lie a one way  
Cold existence,  
All the while.

Stare the problem right between

Born into this world a broken home  
Surrounded by love yet all alone  
Forced into a life that's split in two  
A mother and a father both pulling you  
Then you had to deal with loss and death  
Everybody thinking they know best  
Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions,  
Selfish childish games.  
Vengeful resentments,  
Passing all the blame.  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection,  
Seen from miles away.  
A hopeless affliction,  
Having run astray.

And shaking,  
And left in the cold.

All you have done,  
It's time to take that step  
Into the kingdom.  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong,  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall.  
  
Come to me my friend

I'll help this torture end

Let your ego go

Will vanish when exposed.  
You can't hold onto your secrets,  
They'll only send you back alone.  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions.  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man.

Everyday when I look in the mirror  
I try to see where my soul's at now

Though sometimes she talks like a fool  
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush  
And she picks up the kids after school  
And she puts down the 'phone  
When her husband comes home  
And she changes from mother to wife  
'Til she feels the words hanging between them  
And she hangs by her words to her life  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband

And that's how she knows that she missed  
  
She's a sweetheart except when she's moody  
It's hard to get through to her then  
Depressed for a while when the youngest was born  
Ah, but that happens now and again  
Ah, she might take a drink with the housework  
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop  
A martini or two before dinner  
But she always knows when to stop

Now it's seldom, if ever, they go  
Once you pay for the sitter, and parking the car  
There's no money left for the show

When a glass fell and broke on the tile  
And she cut her wrist, quite by mistake  
It was real touch and go for a while

Has to turn from here and go...  
Running like a child from these warm stars  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.  
  
There are stars in the southern sky.  
And if ever you decide you should go,  
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

Take the devil from your mind

And you're so hard to find  
The wind outside is cold  
Restless feeling in my soul  
Tempting me to get away  
But there's no place a man can go  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show  
No, no you are the one, oh, how could you be  
So blind?  
The devil prays on runaways  
He's never far behind  
The many years I've tried  
Now have been revealed to me  
Closer is the love you'll find  
Waiting so patiently  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show.  
No, no  
Take the devil  
Take the devil  
From your mind

Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry  
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land  
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand  
How someone who had been so close could be so far away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong  
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long  
And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away  
Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday  
  
The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone  
Talking to a memory that's never coming home  
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say  
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday  
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down, lord  
Make it rain  
Oh, make it rain

Well, a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound

But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain

And fill the sky with all that they can draw

Ed Sheeran,Nina,/e/ed+sheeran/nina_21085121.html,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina

We love to dance on a Saturday night  
All alone where I can hold her tight  
But she lives on the twentiest floor uptown  
The elevator's broken down  
  
So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four  
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight, more  
Up on the twelfth I started to drag  
Fifteenth floor I'm a-ready to sag  
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock  
  
When she calls me up on the telephone  
Say, come on over honey, I'm all alone  
I said, baby you're mighty sweet  
But I'm in bed with the achin' feet  
This went on for a couple of days  
But I couldn't stay away  
  
Well they sent to Chicago for repairs  
Till it's a-fixed I'm a-usin' the stairs  
Hope they hurry up before it's too late  
Want my baby too much to wait  
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down  
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail  
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight four

Her tiny hand was locked in his, two hearts beatin' a chord

With young love that just won't die  
They stopped to pick a pebble, each one must make a wish  
They cast them out into the blue and sealed it with a kiss  
They stood beneath an elmtree, carved initials in a heart  
And pledged to undying love, which only death could part  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
Just won't die, will not die, never die

You'll be the way your were before  
When you don't want me anymore  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave  
A lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye  
Don't turn around, don't let it die  
When shadows fall, when day is done  
All through the night, all of my life  
Don't walk away  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known  
Has ended and I'm all alone  
  
Where will I go, where will I be  
The feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on

And the lord of life came following, his sins to be forgiven  
While the world sat back and laughed away the hours  
Till the dawning of the daybreak  
  
I heard them laugh I heard them cry  
I saw them praying to the sky  
I heard the wind howl in the trees  
Down there on bended knee  
And I see the light  
But I know I must be dreaming  
  
Feel the soul, quiet emotion  
Sail on by, helpless devotion  
If that's how it feels, it better be real  
  
Take care of your woman  
Or you'll never ever see the light  
Take heed of the warnin'  
Or you know it's gonna be too late  
  
Here, there, everywhere  
They keep on movin' without fear  
They look me up, they look me down  
They press my body to the ground  
But I see the light, see the light it's comin' shinin'  
  
And on a summers day  
When thoughts are drifting far away  
And life is good and real to see  
My world is saved and I am free  
But in the night  
Still I know I must be dreaming

Now I just wait for someone to call  
I'm waiting for it every day  
  
Send it, on the wires  
Send it, on a plane  
Send it, on an express  
But send it back to me again  
  
The music plays so loud and clear  
But somehow I can't make you hear  
The dream is gone  
The dream is just a memory (yeah)  
If you see my dream, send it back home to me  
  
When you get what you want, it's a long way down  
And you can see for miles around  
When you lose it, nothing is for real  
If you see my dream, send it back to me  
  
Send it, on the wires

And you hurt so bad you lost everything

Watching the clock on the shelf

I hate to grow older

I'm longing to be in his place?  
Won't you change partners and dance with me?  
  
Ask him to sit this one out.  
While you're alone,  
I'll tell the waiter to tell  
Him he's wanted on the telephone.  
  
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.  
Won't you change partners and then,  
You may never want to change partners again.

And touches with her hand the summer trees,  
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.  
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,  
  
A winding country lane all russet brown,  
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.  
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,  
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.  
  
I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view  
So early, early.  
Darling if you care, please, let me know,  
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.  
Let's never have to share another early autumn.

It's impolite  
To stamp your foot at me  
Is not quite right.  
At man's ingratitude  
A woman winks,  
But such an attitude just stinks.  
  
I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.  
I have words that do not come from children's books  
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,  
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.  
There are hammerlock holds,  
I've mastered a few,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Share for share, share alike,  
You get struck each time I strike.  
You for me- me for me-  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'm not yours for better but for worse,  
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.  
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,  
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you.  
  
Don't raise your voice at me,  
That's very rude.  
To raise your voice at me  
Is rather crude.  
It's wrong essentially when woman yells,  
And confidentially, it smells.  
  
I'll converse with you on politics at length,  
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.  
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put,  
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot.  
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Off to bed we will creep,  
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep  
Till the birds start to peep.  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'll be yours forever and a day  
If the first good breeze does not blow me away.  
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
  
You may have some things that I can't use at all.  
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small.  
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
You won't know how good I am until you try  
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry.  
I've a marvelous way of telling you no,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
And everything you want belongs to me!  
And everything you need belongs to me!  
  
Life has no shape or form  
And no design.  
It isn't life without  
That fool of mine.  
I used to gad about  
With any chap  
And now I'm sad about my sap.  
  
He's a living thing that isn't quite alive,  
He has brains enough for any child of five.  
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone.  
He has eyes for every skirt except my own.  
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
Something beats in his chest,  
But it's just a pump at best.  
I'm for him, he's for him.  
He gives me plenty of nothing.  
When I see that funny face, I know  
Something scared his mother twenty years ago.  
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!  
Till everything he's got belongs to me!  
  
And everything I've got belongs to him!  
And everything I've got belongs to us!

Ella Fitzgerald,Imagination,/e/ella+fitzgerald/imagination_20045786.html,"Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
  
Imagination is crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
Starts you asking a daisy  
What to do, what to do?  
  
Have you ever felt  
A gentle touch and then a kiss  
And then and then  
Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well  
  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy-nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

And while our blood's still young  
It's so young  
It runs  
And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.  
  
Songs of desperation  
I played them for you  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud,  
A kiss, a cry  
Our rights, our wrongs,  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
  
So stay there,  
Because I'll be coming over.  
And while our blood's still young

And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.

I'm not being intrusive  
I just wish I knew the truth  
  
As to why  
I wait for you  
Longer than the average person would  
And why  
I think about you  
More than I think one should  
  
Our bodies fit together  
Like a make-shift puzzle  
And it's clear to see why you puzzle me  
And you turn your frame  
And you whisper my name  
As though I am a burden  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
  
I am at your house  
So I belong to you for now  
Trying to impress you  
But lord I don't know how  
I can be a statue  
If you want me to  
I'm not being difficult  
I just need to know the truth  
  
As to why  
I'm wanting you  
And I would take you if I could  
And why I'm still (lay?) here  
It's something I still haven't understood  
  
Our hands rest together  
Like pieces of paper  
But they're always blank  
When I hold your hand  
And it gave you a fright  
When I stayed the night  
And you gave yourself to me  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?

Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went

When our bodies meet, it's everything  
This is was a beautiful vision  
Even love was not a way you could describe it  
And then there comes a collision  
Nothing ever goes in the night

While the auctioneers all played cards

If I only could tell you  
If you only would listen  
I've got a line or two to use on you  
I've got a romance we could christen

But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man  
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere  
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears  
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish  
  
If you can't comprehend  
Read it in my eyes  
If you don't understand it's love  
In a thin disguise  
And what it takes to move you  
Each time that you resist  
Is more than just a pretty face  
To prove that I exist  
  
When manners make no difference  
And my gifts all lay undone  
I trade my accent in on chance  
And fall back on a foreign tongue

Inside those icy walls  
But how on earth in this universe  
Can they forgive me of my pains  
For all across the havens  
I must stumble locked in chains  
  
Then the mother of mercy  
Showed me her stable  
And told me you would be safe  
Safe in her cradle

And a little weed just to level me sometime  
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call  
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall  
When you're high as this you think you know it all  
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And still that saying gets inside my mind  
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind  
I built it up and the wolf he came around  
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

When the whistle screams, Angeline

Somewhere in the future there's more pay  
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash  
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash  
And bite me, Angeline, let me use  
You like a sex machine, Angeline  
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card

Swing that hammer and sew my jeans

Well, I talk tough, I act rough  
Lay still honey, I can't get enough  
And keep your nose clean, let me be  
On your knees when you speak to me  
And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty  
And I'll make you scream, Angeline

And if you stare into the darkness  
You might see celestial light  
And if your heart is empty  
And there's no hope in sight  
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

If you have nothing to believe  
And if you can't hold onto something  
You might as well die where you sleep  
You don't need a prayer  
And there's no price to ask why  
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And it's all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And I'm banking on a chance we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men

On the bad side of the moon

Without the rustic spoon  
  
Common people live with me  
Where the light has never shone  
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds  
To speak in a foreign tongue  
  
I'm a light world away  
From the people who make me stay  
Sitting on the bad side of the moon  
  
There ain't no need for watchdogs here  
To justify our ways  
We live our life in manacles  
The main cause of our stay  
  
Exiled here from other worlds  
My sentence comes too soon  
Why should I be made to pay  
On the bad side of the moon

Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer  
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore  
  
Had garlands in the wings back then  
All the pretty little things back then  
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings  
After curtain calls and bows  
I can't see the front row now  
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They refused to go the distance

I can't explain  
I can't cross over any more

Rain and wire  
And common sense in pieces  
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.  
  
Look outside  
Summer's lost and gone  
It's a long walk  
On a street of right and wrong  
In every inch of sadness  
Rock and tanks  
Go hand in hand with madness  
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.  
  
And it's sad when they sing  
And hollow ears listen  
Of smokin' black roses  
On the streets of Belfast  
And so say your lovers  
From under the flowers  
Every foot of this world  
Needs an inch of Belfast  
  
Who's to say  
On whom Heaven smiles  
Our different ways  
We try harder to recognize  
No more enchanted evenings  
The pubs are closed  
And all the ghosts are leaving  
But you'll never let them shut you down,  
Belfast.

And hollow ears listen  
Of smokin' black roses

Needs an inch of Belfast  
  
The enemy is not at home

Streaks down this faulty diamond  
No bloody boots or crucifix  
Can ever hope to split this emerald island

And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning  
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light  
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight  
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse  
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news  
  
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches  
They always could find us but they never could catch us  
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe  
We watched the arrested get taken away  
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat  
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street  
  
Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire  
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired  
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side  
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

When I was twenty and you were seventeen  
  
So out of choice I chose rock and roll  
But it pushed me to the limit everyday  
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home  
From there on, there seemed no use for you  
For you to stay  
  
And if I shower around 3 a.m.  
It's just to wash away  
The trace of a love unwanted

They used to say that boys are tough as nails  
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail  
Now things have changed, I feel so old  
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals  
  
I was always there in the thick of things  
I always had the heart of every woman on a string  
The danger zone shone from my eyes  
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile  
  
It's not the night reaching in and touching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
It's not the light shining in and catching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
But time has come and cast a spell on me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
And now I know what lonely means  
I used to give so little and gain everything  
The darkest part of every day  
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away  
  
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt  
After all I treated each and every one like dirt  
Who wants a heart that's never home  
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If we're gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky

Burn it down to stay alive

Take all you need to live inside  
  
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today  
My wife cried when they came to take me away

Waking up on a sky high wire  
Desperation leaves us clinging  
On the edge of a house on fire

Every flame that ever moved you  
Touched your lips but never mine

Cold stares and angry words

The telegram still in her hand  
As whispers circulate all day  
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

And you can trap the free bird  
But you'll have to clip her wings  
Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies  
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies  
  
Promises of no more lies  
Fell flat upon an empty stage  
Before the audience arrived  
A return in time to the cheaper seats  
She never knew what lay beneath  
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets  
  
Let down before the final curtain  
A shallow heart that left her cold  
She left in rouge upon the mirror  
A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her

But I'm such a fool at times  
I still search my shaving mirror  
Looking for your face with mine  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
  
Chalk up one more crazy notion  
Imagination running wild  
But if I needed confirmation  
I would have gone that extra mile  
  
You're the last chance on the highway  
I'm that open stretch of road  
You're the diner in my rear-view  
A cup of coffee getting cold  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
  
Bruised in this cold war of words  
We've come undone two loose ends alone  
Possessed by that curse you've endured  
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight

You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean  
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive  
In the English rain again  
  
And I can still recall wet afternoons  
When we were small and simply childish  
But you've created your own ghost  
And the need you have is more than most to hide it  
  
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes  
Beyond a shadow of a doubt  
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise  
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy  
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child  
  
I remember still those lazy summer days  
We'd kill out hunting danger  
And we were alien to all outsiders  
We had no desire to talk to strangers

I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets  
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown  
  
I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple  
I was licking my lips till his Son come down  
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
I'm taking a turn in the right direction  
By leaving his soul in the lost and found  
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
  
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock them  
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing the crown  
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps  
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout ""Hey I'm chasing the crown""

But all are agreed as they join the stampede  
You should never take more than you give

It's the leap of faith  
It's the band of hope

On the path unwinding  
In the circle, the circle of life  
  
Some of us fall by the wayside  
And some of us soar to the stars  
And some of us sail through our troubles  
And some have to live with the scars  
  
There's far too much to take in here  
More to find than can ever be found  
But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky  
Keeps great and small on the endless round

And this hot little trio plays  
  
That's where we meet  
That's where we meet  
Me and you rendezvous  
In the club at the end of the street  
Oh, where we meet

Where the catwalks gently sway  
You hear the sound of Otis  
And the voice of Marvin Gaye  
In this smoky room  
There's a jukebox, plays all night  
And we can dance real close  
Beneath the pulse of a neon light  
  
There's a downtown smell of cooking  
From the flame on an open grill  
There's a sax and a big bass pumping  
Lord, have mercy

Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn  
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned  
  
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down  
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground  
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend  
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end  
  
Every new version of the way of life  
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide  
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died  
  
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell  
The difference for you between heaven and hell  
To glorify something, your legends are found  
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground  
  
Years rolling by just like a dream  
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine  
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone  
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone

A mantle of bright light shone down from a room  
  
Come down in time I still hear her say  
So clear in my ear like it was today  
Come down in time was the message she gave  
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way  
  
Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet  
But a true love like hers is a hard love to get  
And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call  
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all  
  
Come down in time I still hear her say  
So clear in my ear like it was today  
Come down in time was the message she gave  
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Honest to yourself  
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race  
Further on the shelf""

A dog in the yard  
And a year since I saw you  
There's a trunk in the corner  
I keep all my letters  
My bills and demands I keep too  
  
Well I can't help thinking  
About the times  
You were a wife of mine  
You aimed to please me  
Cooked black-eyed peas-me  
Made elderberry wine  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all the time  
Feeling fine on elderberry wine  
Those were the days  
We'd lay in the haze  
Forget depressive times  
How can I ever get it together  
Without a wife in line  
To pick the crop and get me hot  
On elderberry wine  
  
Round a tree in the summer  
A fire in the fall  
Flat out when they couldn't stand  
The bottle went round  
Like a woman down south  
Passed on from hand to hand

I haven't got the words

I suppose its like forgetting,  
Losing who you are,  
And at the same time,  
Something makes you whole,  
Its like that there's a music,  
Playing in your ear,  
And I'm listening, and I'm listening  
And then I disappear  
  
And then I feel a change  
Like a fire deep inside  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
And suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
It's a bit like being angry,  
It's a bit like being scared,  
Confused and all mixed up,  
And mad as hell,  
It's like when you've been crying,  
And you're empty, and you're full,  
I don't know what it is,  
It's hard to tell,  
  
Its like that there's some music,  
Playing in your ear,  
But the music,  
Is impossible,  
Impossible to hear,  
  
But then I feel it move me,  
Like a burning deep inside,  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide

And dark brown eyes  
Always unprepared  
For your pointed replies  
Cynical and lean  
I lie awake and dream about you  
  
If you only knew  
What I'm going through  
Time and again I get ashamed  
To say your name  
It's hard to grin and bear  
When you're standing there  
My lips are dry  
I catch your eye and look away  
  
Sitting in my room

Crying for the moon

Talks to her sisters in the ground

I heard a prophesy all around  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds  
But Emily don't be afraid  
When the weight of angels weighs you down  
  
Emily prays to a faded hero  
In a little frame clutched to her gown  
Hears the voice of promise in his memory  
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down  
In a cage sits a gold canary  
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom  
As a soul ascends aboard the evening  
Canary sings to an empty room  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds

What happened here  
As the New York sunset disappeared  
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And now it all looks strange  
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain  
  
[Verse 2]  
And what's it for  
This little empty garden by the brownstone door  
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed  
A gardener like that one, no-one can replace  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've been knocking but no one answers  
And I've been knocking most all the day  
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny  
Can't you come out to play?  
  
[Verse 3]  
And through their tears  
Some say he farmed his best in younger years  
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear  
Who lived there  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls  
We hear, we hear your name

Make me wish that I had wings take me high above  
  
And I looked high and saw the empty sky

I'd drift with them in endless space  
But no man flies from this place

The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far  
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above  
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love  
  
Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck  
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet  
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land  
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man

Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Hope springs eternal  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
April's come and the air smells fresh with rain  
They watched his shadow fade around the bend  
He's headed for a different kind of thunder  
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free  
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here  
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side

Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken  
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken

On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause  
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws  
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark  
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the

This is my battleground, baby  
This is my plaything  
The only thing I've ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring

Let me get electric, put a silk suit on

And caught him unawares  
  
And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land  
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand

Tight in the brightest grenadine

Once you're inside that costume ball  
And now I'm sitting here before the mirror  
I have the skill still to disguise my tears  
Then as the magic starts to fade  
I find myself abandoning the masquerade  
  
Even though you're suffering  
You try to hide it  
And pretend you're so nonchalant  
You can cry a pool of tears  
And sit beside it  
Then perhaps you'll know what you want  
  
I hope you never feel this much despair  
Or know the meaning of that empty chair  
As the illusions that we made all fade away  
In this abandoned masquerade

Because they don't deserve us  
  
Holding your life in your hand  
With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a has-been  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
He's in prison now she's running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where she's been  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets

Elvis Costello,Ascension Day,/e/elvis+costello/ascension+day_20969315.html,"Not a soul was stirring  
Not a bird was singing, at least not within my hearing  
I was five minutes past caring  
Standing in the road just staring  
  
Thought I heard somebody pleading  
I thought I heard someone apologize  
Some fell down weeping  
Others shook their fists up at the skies  
And those who were left  
Seemed to be wearing disguises  
  
Now there's a queen in waiting  
Not enough loving and too much hating  
For the prince hidden within her man  
Always seems to be hesitating  
  
He said, ""Let her go, let her go, God bless her""  
""She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her""  
""Except every minute of every hour of every day when I wish I could possess
her""  
  
Forty days passed by  
Forty alibis  
So carry on...that way  
And in time...you'll pay  
But we'll all be together  
Come Ascension Day  
  
Not a hound was howling  
Or whimpering or prowling  
Now the wind had departed  
Not a leaf was hanging on the tree like when it started  
  
But I know they will return  
Like they've never gone away  
Come Ascension Day

Elvis Costello,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,/e/elvis+costello/dont+let+me+be+misunderstood_20047375.html,"Baby can you understand me now  
Sometimes I feel a little mad  
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel  
When things go wrong I seem to be mad  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Baby sometimes I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry  
And then I know you're bound to see my other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I get mad at you I want you to know  
That I never mean to take it out on you  
Life has its problems and I get my share  
But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you  
Oh don't you know I'm human  
I've got my faults just like any one  
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting  
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done

Before it's brushed aside  
Just as it's swept away  
  
It's just the evidence  
It's of no consequence  
It's only flesh and bone  
Why don't you leave it alone?  
  
If dust could only gather into lines of chalk  
Around a silhouette detective fiction walks  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Why did they dam the land?  
How did they flood the plain?  
Did they erase the name?  
And wipe away the stain  
You kept your mouth well shut  
Appeared to turn your coat  
Now there's a name for you but it's stuck in my throat

Or in laughter trill  
If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth?  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come The Poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
When they are made of money  
Here come the Lamb of God  
And the butcher's boy, Sonny

Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back  
If dust could only gather in a needle track

The man with the diamond ring is purring  
All claws for now withdrawn  
One by one they bring  
His renegade stories to her  
His crimes and his glories to her  
In challenge they look on  
Women he has wanted grow old too soon  
He tilts their tired faces  
Gently to the spoon

A plane in the rain is humming  
The wires in the walls are humming  
Some song-some mysterious song  
Bars in her head  
Beating frantic and snowblind  
Romantic and snowblind  
She says-his crime belongs

Each with charm to sway  
Are staring eye to eye

Even though the signal's indistinct

Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out  
I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions  
I suppose he'll never know about  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?

Elvis Costello,Home Truth,/e/elvis+costello/home+truth_20047313.html,"I hung up the phone tonight  
Just as you said I love you  
Once this would have been coincidence  
Now these things start to bother me  
You still close your eyes when I kiss you  
And I close mine too  
But we didn't open them again  
Quite as wide as we should  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
Does your touch feel the same as it should do  
Or is it someone quite similar  
Who killed me with kindness last night  
Now do I look at all familiar?  
But none of these things seem to matter  
Since we've grown apart  
I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered  
But I don't know where to start  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
And I feel like a clown  
It's tearing me up  
It's tearing me down  
  
You say which are the lies that you tell me  
Well where do I begin?  
So I turn on the TV again  
And the world comes crashing in  
Is it my shirt or my toothpaste  
That is whiter than white?  
Is it the lies that I tell you  
Or the lies that I might?  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends

She's coming in between us you know that she is  
I'm not holding on to her but one of us is  
My hands are in my pocket, my face is in a book  
She could walk 'round naked and I wouldn't sneak a look

Honey are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She walked in and your eyes flew out the door  
You squeezed my hand 'til the circulation ceases

She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces

It's time to stop pretending things are real  
  
'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind  
And I just don't know what's right or wrong  
To take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do  
A chance I might wake up and find you gone  
  
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue  
Any private flame could be a lie  
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you  
But I know I'll only make you cry  
  
A thief can only steal from you  
He cannot break your heart  
He can never touch the precious things inside  
Someone like you should surely be  
  
Miles and miles away from me  
Then you'd never care how much I lied  
So try to understand the pain  
It takes so long when I explain  
Please don't you forget how much I lied

Somebody else's paint

Every fleeting thought is a pearl  
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway  
Of the funniest fucker in the world  
  
They're here to help you  
Satisfy your desire  
There's a bright future for all you professional liars

They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails  
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze  
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""  
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""  
With their contraption of barbed wire  
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require  
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn  
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains  
Heads shaven and shorn

Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker  
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully  
You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered  
Philosophy

Whose ever bad intention has been purged  
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you  
Didn't have the courage  
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of  
Twisted dilettante  
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think  
They know what they want  
Scratch your own head stupid  
Count up to three  
Roll over on your back

Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore

And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

Stretched out on her poor jealous husband's pillow

While the parents of those kidnapped children  
Start the bidding for their tears

Will swoop down and devour the white man's burden

Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?  
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?

I rarely dream of anyone  
  
In the songs of shame and the tales of dread  
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead  
And all the vines wind through their eyes

I'll honor your order  
Cause it's such sweet torture  
To carry this torch  
In the light of temptation  
Beyond conversation and all expectation  
Pausing a moment or two just to mention...  
Impatience

In invisible ink

You can take me over  
You can give me a lip  
You can take me under  
You can give me the slip  
Take off everything or tear me off a strip  
Like a lady in the chamber  
And another in the clip

Don't move a muscle baby  
Don't even flinch  
You can miss me by a mile  
Or just inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
You can pull me up again  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
As pulses race  
I long to see that look upon your face  
  
You can take me outside  
You can take me apart  
You can take me upstairs  
You can take me to heart  
You made me love you when  
You thought you were so smart  
Don't try to stop me when  
You told me to start

But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
You won't know who to thank  
You won't know who to blame  
It's just a part of the murdering game  
Cause down in the fleshpots  
Where they pay you in pounds  
They're laughing like drains  
And baying like bloodhounds  
For the Jack of all parades  
The Jack of all parades  
  
Once I knew a girl  
That looked so much like Judy Garland  
That people would stop and give her money  
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby  
Not the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, of all parades.  
  
Now the way that I feel is no longer news  
You know my love and how to refuse it  
Cause you know where the door is  
And how to use it  
Oh you know you do  
  
But from my checkered past  
To this shattered terrace  
Where you can't keep your mind off  
The crimes of Paris  
And you can't keep your peace  
And try to forget it  
And I can't forgive you  
For things you haven't done yet  
  
Oh I was anybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
When we first met I didn't know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked 'round my mouth  
I didn't mean to say it  
I just blurted it out  
As you pretended not to notice  
Or be taken aback  
And I loved you there and then  
It's as simple as that  
  
Oh I was everybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
To be the love of one true heart

And someone comes and sweeps it up  
And then he doffs his cap  
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom  
And they're shutting someone's trap  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present  
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.  
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,  
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,  
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.  
  
It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,  
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope.  
There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,  
The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.  
  
You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,  
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.  
To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.
