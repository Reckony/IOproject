You always will be mine. It's everlasting love.  
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong,

Every interesting chapter  
  
Every twist, every turn  
You're my willing accomplice to the lessons  
I've learned  
Till the end of the story  
  
I'll be riveted  
And when I write my dedication I'll say  
I will always need your love  
Wish I could write it in the daily news  
  
I will always need your love  
It would be very hard to fill your shoes  
I will always need your love  
So many ways that I depend on you  
  
I will always need your love  
No one else, no one else, could love me like you  
You know all of my faults  
Every strength, every quirk  
  
You can dictate a handbook on the way that I work  
Many towering hurdles  
You've helped me climb  
What was already great is even better with time  
  
You've discovered each secret  
Every fantasy  
The only thing I really need you to see  
I will always need your love  
  
Wish I could write it in the daily news  
I will always need your love

They just talk and talk all day  
But there's a sweeter situation, and  
It's just a touch away  
One kiss can say all that we need to say  
Don't have to tell me you care  
The message gets through  
With the things you're doing  
When we're alone in the dark, you speak  
To my soul, talk to my heart  
In the language of love, we say everything  
Every time that we touch we say so much  
In the language of love, nothing says it better  
Than when we're talking together  
Touch by touch in the language of love  
In the language of love  
This love don't need no explanation  
We understand just fine, oh baby  
Got heart to heart communication  
I tell ya that's the sweetest kind

Real 'cause we go by feeling  
We don't need words to express what's in our hearts we say it best

But all I can hope is that you take it as a challenge  
To create something new that will take you far

I've cried for all it's worth a few times  
I've lived and loved in search of truth  
I've seen a lot of pain oh, oh, oh, to finally realize  
The reason for this life  
Is to say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't hang on to the tears we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel  
That we are so free, we are free  
I've seen the bottom once or twice  
I've soared above the earth as suddenly  
I've made a few mistakes, it's true  
I've seen enough of hate, oh, oh, oh, to finally realize  
There's not much more to life  
Than to say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't hold on to the fears we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel  
We are so free, we are free  
We may long for happiness  
Pray to God that we be blessed  
Save us from this loneliness  
After all that I've been through  
I believe the thing to do  
Is to look inside of you  
And just say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't give up all the years we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel

After knowing all the pain it brings  
Always hoping to feel your arms around me  
Without fear of losing everything  
It's the heart that will awaken all the senses  
And the senses light up the soul  
But we hide what we feel with more pretenses  
Than the pride that comes before the fall  
Thinking that it's finally my turn

A child, a child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere, listen to what I say  
Pray for peace, people everywhere, listen to what I say  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night, he will bring us goodness and light

For when they placed it on his head

Before I melt away?

With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square

Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler, ""Stop""

In tempest, storm, and wind

Whereat this infant lay  
They found him in a manger  
Where oxen feed on hay

Unto the Lord did pray

That's what the showman said  
First you must open the curtain  
And stand 'em on their heads  
There can be no inhibitions  
No prima donna ways  
If you want to pass the audition  
And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr. Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her, she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Won't leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr. Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn

Gordon Lightfoot,A Passing Ship,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+passing+ship_20061566.html,"A passing ship  
I have found the open ocean  
Give me no lip  
The waves roll by as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the first day of April  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me when I'm gone?  
How many words  
How many songs still unwritten?  
How many ships  
Of the line have come and gone?  
In the good old days  
May they never be forgotten  
They had heavy wind  
Or they had no wind at all  
A passing ship  
It is midnight on the ocean  
Had a real long trip  
I have been at sea all winter  
When my ship came in  
I was givin' up the ghost  
I think I should be  
Leavin' those passing ships alone  
When the sea runs high  
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady  
And I think of you  
In the warmth of your home and family  
When love is true  
There is no truer occupation  
And may this gale  
Blow us to the ones we love  
Another day, another ocean  
Give me no lip  
But stand aside as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the last day in October  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me from now on?  
I guess I should be  
Leavin' passing ships alone

The Chinook wind is a-movin' in  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
Though I've done the best I could  
My old luck ain't been so good and  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
No one-eyed man could e'er forget  
The Rocky Mountain sunset  
It's a pleasure just to be Alberta bound  
I long to see my next of kin  
To know what kind of shape they're in  
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
  
Oh the skyline of Toronto  
Is somethin' you'll get onto  
But they say you've got to live there for a while  
And if you got the money  
You can get yourself a honey  
A written guarantee ta make you smile  
But it's snowin' in the city  
And the streets and brown and gritty  
And I know there's pretty girls all over town  
But they never seem ta find me  
And the one I left behind me  
Is the reason that I'll be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound

I wish that I could know them one by one  
All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds

Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness  
Heaven can be yours just for now.  
  
All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile  
To everyone who cannot hold a pen  
To all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains  
Who dread the thought of going 'round the bend  
  
Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things  
Heaven can be yours just for now.  
  
To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight  
I wish that I could kiss you while you knit  
To all the ones who learn to live with bein' second-guessed  
Whose job it is to give more then to get  
  
Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand  
Heaven can be yours just for now.  
  
To all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last  
To all the sleeping giants who must wake  
To every man who answers to the letter of the law  
And all the rest imprisoned by mistake  
  
Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass  
Heaven can be yours just for now  
  
To all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen  
To all of you with heartache that remains  
Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore  
If someone could relieve you of your chains  
  
Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea  
Heaven can be yours, just for now

In that quiet place where dreams abide  
You and I together are a bit of all right  
Feeling good is how we whish to be

In my time and in each line I've ever sung

And I would try any scheme for love  
We'd do anything for love  
Once or twice  
In my loneliness I watched the world go by  
There was I  
One too many miles beyond where you might say  
Some luck was due, after all  
We could have touched the sky  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, I would try any means  
To have you in all my dreams because  
You'd do anything for love  
Not long ago as I remember  
Once upon a dark and windy day  
When love looked like a dying ember  
Before you came to call  
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet  
'Cause in my life  
There in my mind in it now shines  
A guiding light  
Never again will I lose my way  
Ohh, I would not tell a lie and  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, you'd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
Simply anything for love  
Ohh, I would do anything  
Just about anything because  
We'd do anything for love  
Anything for love

Gordon Lightfoot,Ballad Of Yarmouth Castle,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ballad+of+yarmouth+castle_20061662.html,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
She's bound across the waves  
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it  
Now the many years she's been to sea  
She's seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
There's laughter overhead  
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  
Now it's midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin' bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
There's many who are sleepin' now  
It's been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning  
Let someone understand""  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin' of the band  
Everybody's dancin' on her deck  
And they're havin' such a time  
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord, how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'  
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain, says  
""Boatswain, we are lost""  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin'  
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now  
It's spreadin' fore and aft  
The people are a-scramblin'  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And they're fallin' in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star  
Comes steamin' through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin'  
And 'tis a terrible sight  
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries  
""We'll save you if we can""  
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  
""God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day""  
Now the heroes, they are many  
But the times are growin' slim  
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'  
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'  
She's cryin' like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides?  
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'  
But the livin' soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown

Waiting through the years

Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss

But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss

And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land  
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands  
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land  
  
Black day in July

In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound  
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground  
Upon the filthy pavement  
No reason can be found

Motor City madness has touched the countryside  
And the people rise in anger  
And the streets begin to fill  
And there's gunfire from the rooftops  
And the blood begins to spill

In the mansion of the governor  
There's nothing that is known for sure  
The telephone is ringing  
And the pendulum is swinging  
And they wonder how it happened  
And they really know the reason  
And it wasn't just the temperature  
And it wasn't just the season

They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake  
And everyone is listening

And the news is quickly flashed  
And you read your morning paper  
And you sip your cup of tea  
And you wonder just in passing  
Is it him or is it me  
  
Black day in July  
  
In the office of the President  
The deed is done the troops are sent  
There's really not much choice you see  
It looks to us like anarchy  
And then the tanks go rolling in  
To patch things up as best they can  
There is no time to hesitate  
The speech is made the dues can wait

The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene  
But the shapes of gutted buildings  
Strike terror to the heart  
And you say how did it happen  
And you say how did it start  
Why can't we all be brothers  
Why can't we live in peace  
But the hands of the have-nots  
Keep falling out of reach

And through the smoke and cinders

Gordon Lightfoot,Canadian Railroad Trilogy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/canadian+railroad+trilogy_20061665.html,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
  
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds  
As to this verdant country they came from all around  
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall  
And they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us  
All  
  
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring  
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring  
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day  
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay  
  
For they looked in the future and what did they see  
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea  
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land  
All up through the seaports and into their hands  
  
Look away said they across this mighty land  
From the eastern shore to the western strand  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails

Open 'er heart let the life blood flow

Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'  
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day  
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping  
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done  
  
So over the mountains and over the plains  
Into the muskeg and into the rain  
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe  
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay  
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down  
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town  
A dollar a day and a place for my head  
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead  
  
Oh the song of the future has been sung  
All the battles have been won  
O'er the mountain tops we stand  
All the world at our command  
We have opened up the soil  
With our teardrops and our toil  
  
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
And many are the dead men too silent to be real.

Gordon Lightfoot,Clouds Of Loneliness,/g/gordon+lightfoot/clouds+of+loneliness_20826065.html,"What can you do? You'll never win  
Where will you go when night closes in?  
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?  
Where will it stop?  
Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love?  
So many years, push came to shove  
You had a dream, so they had one too  
You turned away, they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go? What will you do  
When your whole world ain't talking to you?  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby, it's time you hope it's right  
And I'm all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyone's guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness

At the cradle she bought  
For the little tot she held to her breast  
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love

Why some reap the harvest while other men die

suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.

Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers, saints and other starts

In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home, by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles, beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I ain't found yet  
Pickin' with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hi'way songs

With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin' in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
I'm a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain

She's got something on her mind  
When she tells the age old story,  
Of a life she left behind  
In the warmth of the morning light,  
She will turn and hold me tight  
She's my inspiration lady,  
Soft, sad situation lady  
She's my situation every day  
  
Seems like I will always love her,  
Inspiration every day  
And I like to think, hey maybe,  
I can drive her blues away

And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks  
They know her love is not for sale  
She will never fail me 'cause I know  
I watch her grow  
And the mother of a miner's child  
Waits for me beside the kitchen door  
She is my light  
In this place where the darkness never ends  
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend  
She's the only one who listens when I tell her  
I got less than I can spend  
She knows the pace  
Oh mother of a miner's child  
Wash away the coal dust from my face  
When the night shift's done  
She'll be waiting by the table when I come  
Searchin' for another dream to chase  
Oh a mother of a miner's child  
I know that you still think about the day  
When we'll be movin' on  
Remember dear ole daddy and  
The promise that I made to carry on  
Sometimes I smile  
In the cage where the cables softly hum  
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone  
But the mother of a miner's child  
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home  
Come Saturday  
And he is just a miner's boy  
I hope that he will find a better way  
She is my flower  
And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks  
They know her love is not for sale  
She will never fail me 'cause I know

Gordon Lightfoot,Mountains And Marian,/g/gordon+lightfoot/mountains+marian_20061539.html,"All is well  
I've made my peace where highways never end  
Yesterday's a memory today is just a friend  
For the mountains and Marian are calling me again  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears  
All is well  
I left the cold midwestern towns behind  
There's a semi up the road ahead I'll take him in my time  
For the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again  
And the vagabond within me cries  
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I won't feel the pain  
For the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
As I swing up to the border bent for hell  
And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well  
But the mountains and Marian are calling out to me  
And I got my bedroll on my back  
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way  
  
All is well  
I've made my peace and man, I'm feelin' fine  
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time  
For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime  
And the prairie towns go sailing by  
Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leavin' you behind  
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
The foothills are coming into sight  
Today is just a memory the future is tonight  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do

Gordon Lightfoot,Movin',/g/gordon+lightfoot/movin_10137499.html,"Everybody's movin', movin' across the town,  
The skyline grows and the cut of the clothes,  
Is enough to turn you around.  
Oh, oh the future is just an hour away,  
And the hearts of youth are aflame,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
Fields are turnin', the bridges are burnin',  
And the light turns night into day.  
It's the time to stake it or make it or break it,  
For the time flies quickly away.  
Oh, oh it's the time to start makin' your mark,  
And it's the time to get in the game!  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
  
Upwards, outwards, all around,  
They're reachin' for the sky.  
The ribbons of highway and roads of steel,  
It's a time to be alive!  
Oh, oh, ain't no ragin' river that we can't cross,  
Nor giant too tall to be slain,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!

And they sailed right by each other in the dark

The kind which mystifies

Having you on my knee  
Much to my surprise  
I gotta make you see somehow  
I saw two minds that wandered  
They almost caused a wreck  
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea  
When someone cried hit the deck

Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods  
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good  
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome  
And when all is said and done  
Will she leave me alone  
  
I don't want to get so low  
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas  
  
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time  
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend  
And when all is said and done  
Is there no rainbow's end  
  
I don't want to own the key  
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free

Straight for the highway or down the low road

And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand

They say you travelled far

The room has all gone misty  
My thoughts are all in spin  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us where you been  
Well, I've been up to the mountain  
I've walked down by the sea  
I never questioned no one  
And no one questioned me  
My love was given freely  
And oftimes was returned  
I never came to borrow  
I only came to learn

But it taught me how to cry  
And laughter came too easy

That power does not rule  
That war is not the answer  
That young men should not die

For souls are not reborn  
To wear the crown of peace  
You must wear the crown of thorns

How could He wish them well

Somewhere in the wilderness

I hear your voice softly callin'

To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love

My glass is almost empty  
I read again between the lines upon the page  
The words of love you sent me  
  
If I could know within my heart  
That you were lonely too  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love

The shades of night are liftin'

Where webs of snow are driftin'

And to be once again with with you  
To be once again with with you

It's almost over, it's almost done  
And you can't put the blame on anyone  
It's almost easy and it's almost fun  
Did you get caught with your britches on?  
  
Hi, derry day in the month of May  
Was the song the minstrel sang  
To the good of Robin Hood  
Maid Marion and all the gang  
  
His aim was mean and his shot was clean  
And his suit was the shade of evergreen  
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear  
When the sheriff was there, they were over here  
  
Hi, derry doon in the month of June  
Was the song the minstrel sung  
To the good of Robin Hood's  
Good name and a place to run  
  
He loved strong ale and a run down jail  
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed  
There was no man on the sea or land  
Who could get Maid Marion on the trail

She returned again this morning  
From her long and restless flight

Did not show her much surprise

Like she never said goodbye  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
It was all I could bear  
Just to watch her lying there  
Disowned and ragged princess  
With the sun locked in her hair  
So cold, so frail  
With her mind locked in a jail  
The victim of confusion  
Never knowing she could fail  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
So I rocked her to sleep  
Then I got up on my feet  
And the day was filled with sunshine  
As I gazed across the street  
And the door seemed to say  
Over here, step this way  
The station is for travelers  
Even you must ride someday  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder

Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm  
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer.  
And his pop said ""Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man  
Selling things at auction using our good name.

He come back home a full fledged auctioneer.  
And the people would come from miles around  
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound  
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.

Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children  
Remember the woman who waits

When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail  
Beware of the dangers below  
And the song that you sing should not be too sad  
And be sure not to sing it too slow  
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces  
And know what they're doin' it for  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost  
Consider the burden of fame  
And he who is wise will not criticize  
When other men fail at the game  
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places  
Be careful while bending the law  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal  
Decide what it is that you need  
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live  
Or is it the mouth you must feed  
Be known as a man who will always be candid  
On questions that do not relate

Grateful Dead,Hell In A Bucket,/g/grateful+dead/hell+in+a+bucket_20062409.html,"Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker  
And I showed him a picture of you  
I said, ""Pal get to know her, you'll like her  
Seemed like the least I could do.  
'Cause when he's chargin' his chopper  
Up and down your carpeted halls  
You will think I am dressed up quite proper  
Never mind how I stumble and fall.  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe  
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.  
  
'Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender  
Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets  
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders  
And your chain, your black whip and pets.  
  
Well we know you're the reincarnation  
Of the infamous Catherine the Great  
And we know how you love the ovation  
And the scene that it seems to create.  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe  
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.  
  
You analyze me, tend to despise me  
You laugh when I stumble and fall  
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave  
Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it  
Unable to dance I'll still crawl  
Unable to dance I'll still crawl  
Unable to dance I'll crawl.  
  
You must really consider the circus  
It just might be your kind of zoo  
I can't think of a place that's more perfect  
For a person as perfect as you.  
  
And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely  
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin  
Well I know you wake up here only  
When the snakes come marching in.  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe  
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.  
Ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
At least I'll enjoy the ride.  
At least I'll enjoy the ride.  
At least I'll enjoy the ride.

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun,  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul,  
Standing right beside me, lord, in everything i done,  
Bobby's body kept me from the cold.  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas, lord, i let her slip away,  
Lookin' for that home, i hope she finds,  
And i'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holding bobby's body close to mine.

Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose  
Long train running from coast to coast  
Bringing home a party when you need it the most  
Work on the box car, beat on the bell

The doctor found a simple cure  
Just in time  
  
All these things if I were king  
Would all appear around me  
The world will sing when I am king  
The world will sing when I am king  
  
Oh, she walks right in  
She don't even knock  
It's the girl you lost to the high school jock  
She shuts the door, turns the lock  
And she takes your hand  
She says she always felt a fool  
For picking the captain over you  
She wonders if you missed her  
Said she always told her sister  
Oh, that you're the best damn kisser  
That she's ever had  
  
All these things if I were king  
Would appear around me  
The world will sing when I am king  
The world will sing when I am king  
  
Daylight waits to shine until the moment you awaken  
So you never miss the dawn  
No question now, you know which road you're taking  
Lights all green, the radio plays just the perfect song  
  
Well, the war's been won  
All the fights are fought  
You find yourself in just the spot  
It's a place where everybody's got a song to sing  
Just like the final movie scene  
The prince will find his perfect queen  
The hero always saves the world  
The villains get what they deserve  
The boy will always get the girl  
When I am king

Won't you come down to Yarmouth town  
  
One night there came a sailor man  
He asked the daughter for her hand  
Well I won't marry you she said  
I have all I want without being wed  
  
But if with me you'd like to linger  
I'll tie some string all around my finger  
As you walk by, pull on my string  
I'll come down and let you right in

Well the very next day at closing time  
The sailor man goes off to the strand  
And as he walks by pulls on that string  
And she came down and let him right in  
  
Well he's never seen such a sight before  
A string on her finger was all she wore

If ya see those girls with their hair hung low  
All ya gotta do is pull their strings

I don't let it get me down  
  
Looking back upon my life  
And the places that I've been  
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved  
I try to remember when  
But I don't let it get me down  
Or cause me too much sorrow  
There's no doubt about who I am  
I always have tomorrow

Gucci Mane,Decapitated,/g/gucci+mane/decapitated_21069010.html,"(Intro: Gucci Mane)  
I wanna thank God  
For opportunity, success  
Wealth and health  
  
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)  
My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane  
Honestly he turned me on to the ice game  
He fed the fam with 3 tops, that's the current game  
Well fuck you, who are you?  
You ain't God mane  
I fell out with my right hand man, he tried to top on me  
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies  
I'm at the top and I swear to God, it's really lonely  
But I'm not coming down, no stoopin' down, I keep it movin'  
These young nigga's got no respect who make music  
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it  
And the bottom of some valley don't do it like the top do it  
Roll the crisp we hear ak's more than church music  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off, those slick blood knocked off  
Decapitated (Huh?)  
Decapitated  
Decapitated (Bang), bow down  
Decapitated (It's Gucci)  
  
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane)  
I know African's that cut off legs  
Jamaican's that cut off heads (What's up bumbaclot)  
This millionaire still in the feds  
You in the county and you can't get outta jail nigga?  
Damn, that's so sad  
That's so bad  
You played out, jj bad  
Mob ties put a head in your bed (horse head)  
You touch Guwop and they goin' mine and wrap yo head  
I got so much overhead, I gave him diamond bricks instead  
And I chumm without a charm, diamond chain and watch instead  
Team some team  
My grandad in house and I stay next door to Ned  
Cooking dope instead of eggs  
Hundred pt's in my fridge  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem

I got so much clientele, black tee, black Gat and a pocket scale  
So I can't go broke man, niggas know me as the Dope man's dope man

And they asking for a wake up, you wanna a brick I gotcha covered like make-

When I cut it wit the rich band 2 flips nigga I'ma be a rich man.  
And these robbers trying to plot up, get his car shot up trying take a nigga

These niggas ain't harming me,plus I sell more drugs than a pharmacy.

Big nuts like bowling balls, 30 though and dollar charm and a hole in the

We got a room we was fucking all night  
Do you remember the time girl  
Like I remember the time girl  
  
Girl you my type you just right  
That blouse on you fit just right  
Them jeans she got on skin tight  
Shes sexy cool but still shy  
I'm colder than a Klondike  
Bipolar I got dumb ice  
We know each other we go together  
Like hamburgers and french fries  
Everything's all right  
We'll never have a fist fight  
But last night we had a sex fight  
Then told her have blessed night  
I'm leaning I'm meanin'  
I fall asleep might have dreams in it  
Did the club thing, brought my team in it  
Last night I bring my queen in it  
I go get it you bullshitter's  
I hit it, damn right the kid did it  
You hood critters and hood chickens  
Please stay out my business

From my city to your city

Ironic its gon' hurt  
But when I'm gone

Scented aura candles  
I pull up in my Lambo  
The best sex that you never had  
Two bad streets off the main road  
You had her but she left so  
That's just the way the game go  
No one on my level  
So please get up out on my lane holmes  
I met a girl so real no need to bring no game home  
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song  
I'm on her like a long john  
Short skirt with no thongs on  
Sexy naked sunbathing outside my house with frames on  
I took her from some busters?  
And that boy ain't gon' shit bout it  
Its alright we can tell that sucka to forget about it

Girls to my right  
Ladies to my left  
The weathers so hot  
Snows on my chest  
When I see this fly girl  
Tried to get her number  
Then she tells me  
I already smashed last summer  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
  
Do you remember when

There was something eating everyone  
And the sunshine fund was low  
We couldn't greet you  
With a simple hello  
and the watchers of the flood  
Were busy in their chambers  
Making sure there was new blood  
To sustain their dying veins  
but I believed you  
No need for further questioning  
I'm gonna leave with you  
You can teach me all you know  
Which way will we go now  
On our trip to taller windows  
I really don't know now  
I really don't know  
in the winter that you left  
There was business as usual  
With the same old fears and frustrations  
But the word got out  
It was really such a pity  
but the judges and the saints  
And the textbook committee  
Decided you should be left out  
Not even mentioned  
but I believed you  
No need for further questioning

Which way will we go now

Where broken hearted lovers  
Do cry away their gloom.

And you got a tale to tell.

Why, I've she'd a million tears sweetheart, for you  
It's not easy when the love you've cherished  
Proves falsehearted, careless and untrue.  
  
You built a chain around my heart, dear  
But each link was only sorrow and regret  
For you taught my aching heart to love you  
But you never taught it to forget.  
  
I've tried in vain to find a new love  
That would take your place and teach me to forget  
But I find you'll always have my heart, dear  
I must live in memories of regret.

In my dreams I know I'll find you waiting there  
But I'll wake to find each new tomorrow  
Saddened by a broken love affair...

There lived a man  
And he was brave as he could be  
By the sweat of his brow  
He earned fortune and fame  
Casey Jones was his name  
  
From Memphis, Tennessee  
On that Cannonball Express  
By the whining of the whistle  
You could tell him from the rest  
Past the old plantations  
With their cotton and cane  
Casey Jones was his name  
  
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack  
Over the rails he'd go  
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack  
Bravin' rain and snow  
Ev'ryone knew three-eighty-two was his train  
Casey Jones was his name  
  
Runnin' late through Sardis  
Past Winona on the fly  
Like lightnin' chasin' thunder  
through the stairways of the sky  
When we heard his engine moanin'  
And the story is claimed  
Casey Jones was his name  
  
Then on that fatal night  
He made his final run  
Near Vaughan, Mississippi  
He knew his time had come  
Too late he saw ahead  
There's thatta old freight train  
Now the legend, Casey Jones was his name

Ride their daddy's magic carpet made of steel  
Mothers with their babies asleep rockin' to that gentle beat

The broken shadows from the street lights playing tag upon the wall  
Down the street a neon light is reaching out to mock the night  
And all the little fears that darkness brings.  
  
The smoke of my last cigarette still hangs upon the air and yet  
I reach to light another from the pack that's nearly gone  
And the dawn seems a million miles away but all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just come on  
And turned their ragged collars against the drizzling rain  
Back and forth the yard engine goes about the pulling out  
The railroad cars that soon will be making up the train  
That's gonna be come the morning.  
  
I wonder if I ever cross the mind of someone  
That I might have learned to love  
Had I ever chose to try  
Or did she fail to think about me in the lonely nights without me  
Was she the last to care if I should live or die.  
  
I've been a nameless ghost that rides the empty wave of memory  
In the dark deserted closets of the mind of someone else  
And now I'm a ghost unto myself but still I know.  
  
And now I cross the room and stand before the open window  
And reach out to touch the rain that's slowly falling on my hand  
The pavement hot and cold below looks back at me and seems to know  
It ends without a tear without a smile.  
  
And in those last brief seconds could it be I was mistaken  
Or did I hear a voice somewhere that softly called my name  
Or was it just a whistle of a train for all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just gone home  
To hang their clothes to dry them bar their doors against the rain  
The yard engine breathe a sigh Then pulls a last grey coal car by  
Then moves aside to look with pride Upon the new born train  
That I won't take come the morning.

And enclosed I found a petal from the rose  
That I picked and placed within your hair,  
Dear when we strolled beneath the moon-beams long ago.  
  
You say that you can understand today, dear,  
Why in tears I told you when you went away  
Now you're leaving and I'll be so lonely  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet.  
  
You tell me that tonight you're broken hearted,  
Your happiness in life sweetheart, you say, is through,  
And that you regret the day you left me  
And broken my heart to change an old love for the new.  
  
With aching heart in tears I write this letter,  
Old mem'ries I could never, never cast away.  
I forgive you and you'll find me waiting  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet.

Where the weeping willow waves,  
All alone in tears I'm kneeling  
O'er my sweetheart's lonely grave.

I am asking God's forgiveness,  
For you're waiting there I know,  
Out beyond that blue horizon  
Just across the bridge of gold.  
  
I regret those words I've spoken  
Every yesterday of tears  
That I caused you little darling  
As we wandered through the years

If I'd only read your letter  
Saying you were in despair  
That your weary heart was broken  
And in pain was lying there.  
  
Chorus  
  
I tonight would not be weeping  
O'er the roses on your grave.  
But instead dear I'd be happy  
And this sorrow I'd have saved.  
  
Chorus  
  
If I only would have listened  
When you told me not to stray  
But I said I loved another  
Left you there and went away.

Now my life is sad and lonely  
Down life's path I trudge along  
But I'll meet you up in heaven  
When from this old world I've gone.

So lonesome just waiting for you.  
  
I treasure each thought every memory old pal  
That we spent in the days we once knew  
And it hurt so inside many times I have cried.  
So heartbroken just waiting waiting for you.

And the sunshine again fills the blue  
You'll mend the break in my heart once again we will start  
From where I've waited so worried and blue.

Will he give you a rose he has tended with care  
The first, fairest bloom of the tree

But he said it was the wind that brought them there  
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day  
And his hand went trembling through my hair  
  
Keep tied, mother, my poor little dog  
For I know he will mourn for me too  
Just keep him when old and useless he grows  
Sleepin' the whole summer through  
  
Show him my coat, mother, so he'll not forget  
His master who then will be dead  
Just speak to him kindly and often of Joe  
And pat him on his brown, shaggy head

I said ""Hey sawbones, I'm just carryin' on  
An old family tradition""  
  
So don't ask me  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
Stop and think it over  
Try to put yourself in my unique position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long  
It's a family tradition

Key ddemo recorded by hank williams, probably 1949.  
  
(d) now I've been married about six months,  
Only six (d7) months you (g) see,  
The (a7) first three months, was all ok,  
But the last three is killin (d) me,  
My wife began her hissin, cut down on her kissin,  
And then she failed to (d7) shine my (g) shoes,  
My (a7) shirts they came up wrinkled,  
My pants with dirt were sprinkled,  
And then I took the first year (d) blues.  
  
(d) well then she started naggin,  
She left the sink asaggin,  
With dishes (d7) piled up (g) high,  
No (a7) food upon the table, she said if she was able,  
Shed cook something bye and (d) bye,  
Then I began to wonder, if I had made a blunder,  
When I (d7) said I (g) do, she (a7) must have read my thinkin,  
Her eyes began to blinkin and that gal broke in -(d) - to.  
  
(d) well I heard the dishes crashin,  
And I began to dashin, gettin (d7) out of (g) sight,  
For (a7) right there was my honey,  
On who I'd spent my money, turnin into dy - na - (d) - mite,  
Then after she'd exploded, her meanness all unloaded,  
And things began to (d7) simmer (g) down,  
I (a7) found myself ableedin, and very much aneedin,  
Of stitches taken all a - (d) - round.  
  
(d) well then she started cryin, I felt myself asighin,  
And then I took her (d7) in my (g) arms,  
I (a7) was afraid to scold her, so I just gently told her,  
She didn't do a bit of (d) harm,  
Now the first six months is over, and I am much the older,  
And experienced (d7) with a (g) wife,  
If (a7) I can stand the next six, my friends all say I'll be fixed,  
To take it the rest of my (d) life.

Cause he's a bulky stubborn fool  
He likes to look at you and glare  
An never even move a hair  
  
But when his muscles start to twitch  
An when his tail begins to swish  
That mule ain't bothered with an itch...fly trouble

Did you ever see a jass ack cry  
Buzz buzz buzz  
  
Now you pick a perfect night in June  
When flowers are bloomin' beneath the moon  
And ya light of love is shinin' bright  
An you tell ya self tonight's the night  
  
Ya brace ya self an ya courage grows  
An on ya knees where you would propose

Hit everything except that fly

Hank Williams,Men With Broken Hearts,/h/hank+williams/men+with+broken+hearts_20260690.html,"You'll meet many just like me upon lifes busy street.  
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat.  
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts,  
For a living death is all that's left for men with brokens hearts.  
You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn.  
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him.  
One careless step, a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts  
And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts.  
  
Humble you should be when they come passing by,  
For it's written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry.  
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts,  
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts.  
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes,  
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies.  
  
Some were paupers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts,  
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.  
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death.  
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath?  
So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts!  
For the God that made you, made them too. These men with broken hearts!

Young Johnny stepped down there was fear in his eyes  
But for lover pity he'd gladly die  
  
They still tell the story to this very day  
How their, ma, jumped between them when Jim made it play  
She cried out in anguish oh sons are you blind  
If you must take a life oh Lord let it be mine  
  
Death bells are ringing in Wichita town  
They mourn for a mother whose son's shot her down  
And there in the Wichita's street where she lay  
Blood's thicker than water her smile seemed to say

In a red mercedes  
Driving down from her big house on the hill  
With her mind on fire  
For an old desire  
And sweet memories bring on the tears  
  
And that blue lady  
Would give that red mercedes  
All the money and big house so fine  
Just to feel him touch her one more time  
  
She's sewn and reeped  
And now she's gotta sleep  
In empty arms tonight  
All night she's got her little paradise  
But she's a lonely wife  
If that old flame could burn again  
Would it justify the sin  
I think it would considering the shape her heart is in  
  
And that blue lady  
Would give that red mercedes  
All the money and big house so fine  
Just to feel him touch her one more time  
  
Just to feel him touch her  
Just to feel him touch her  
Just to feel him touch her one more time

House is so quiet  
I spent the morning looking for a job

And I'm wondering  
Just what I'm gonna do  
Someone to hold and the rent  
I owe are long overdue  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
I'm used to having a woman around  
Cooking for me and when I lay down to love  
I got used to having a woman around  
Looking to me to rise above  
  
I've got a lonely heart, two open arms  
And a pillow I never use  
I know it ain't much to offer  
But it's the best I can do  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
I've loved a lot of good women  
And I could sure love one now  
I've had more than enough money  
In my bank account  
  
But where they went and how they got spent  
Isn't really clear  
They just left me here  
And it all disappeared  
  
Sitting in another office Tuesday morning  
Application filled  
I doubt they'll ever call me  
But I can't keep from hoping that they will  
  
I know I need to keep my chin up  
But I'm telling you the truth  
If there's no one else to live for  
Is there anything left to lose?  
  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life, in my life

This music called country, somethin' we all make  
No, it didn't just happen cause of the latest rage  
Soon he was the biggest thing to come along in Nashville in those days  
He sang his song called ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way""  
I don't know if he did or not but I sure know what I saw  
The 1st triple platinum in that town was hanging on his wall  
Radio will play him until the end of time  
Because he's a real legend not the phony kind  
  
And I looked in the eyes of Waylon  
And there I saw things that I'd never seen before  
I saw a father and a brother and a friend  
I saw the nights we spent while out on the road  
It's not the money, it's not the fame, it's not the ladies

There I learned things that I better know

Keep an eye out for the blackfeet. Keep a rifle near hand  
Back shooters and grizzlies, better stay alert all the time  
'Cause the only law here in this wild country is the gun and the knife

So keep that marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die  
  
This freedom's mighty precious in this land of liberty  
I've seen what matrimony done to better men than me  
I don't mind keepin' company with the apple of my eye  
But keep that marryin' out of your head, I'll be a bachelor till I die

I had lot's of luck but it's all been bad  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world a live.  
  
My fishin' pole's broke the creek is full of sand  
My woman run away with another man  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch  
And I was livin'g high until that fatal day  
A lawyer proved I wasn't born  
I was only hatched.  
  
Ev'rything's agin' me and it's got me down  
If I jumped in the river I would prob'ly drown  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time  
Are full of holes and nails  
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime  
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails.  
  
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow  
'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright nohow  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke  
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
If it was rainin' gold I wouldn't stand a chance  
I wouldn't have a pocket in my patched up pants  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.

Country roads, boulevards, and interstates

I know what the cards say  
Sometimes the hard way  
It looks so easy  
  
My curiosity always gets me in a ditch  
What really happens if  
You turn that knob  
Or flip that switch  
Something I shouldn't do  
Why you already knew  
Thats all been taught to me

And I'm dead and gone  
Let em put it on my tombstone

But not enough to leave it alone

On everything a woman wants  
Bout how and when and where  
And why they will  
And why they won't  
Thats complicated stuff

It lights a fire inside of me  
Just show me when this living stops  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
Cut the cord start to breathe  
We're living life at frantic speed  
Don the suit and ride the steed  
With these shackles on you won't come to harm  
I could be the worst of these  
A sinking ship on the open sea  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
All on my own I'm trying  
To change how you see and what you believe  
To fight fire with fire and live eye for eye  
We'll all end up blind and burning  
Burning, burning  
  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart

Hanson,In A Way,/h/hanson/in+a+way_20540654.html,"On the third floor of the hotel there's a pregnant Flamenco dancer  
In the bathtub with a razor and she's planning her great escape  
  
In a way she's giving up on herself, whoooa  
Either way she's giving up some of herself, whoooa  
  
In the backyard there's a small boy playing soldiers with an army ranger  
In the front room there's a mother to the small boy,  
She's a total stranger  
In a way she's giving up on herself, whoooa  
Either way she's giving up some of herself, whoooa  
  
Love is only what you give up  
Life isn't what you get  
Love won't always fill your cup  
But life's when you start to live  
Life's when you learn to give  
  
When I leave here I'm going to go to the small boy  
And that flamenco dancer  
Leave the guitar and the spotlight I'm gonna go home to my biggest fans  
  
In a way I'm giving up some of myself, whoooa  
In a way isn't that what it's about, whoooa

She needed a good time leave the past behind  
She got what she wanted alright

Trumpets sound and angels sing,  
Listen to what they say,  
That Man will live forevermore,  
Because of Christmas day.  
  
(Verse 1)  
While shepherds watched their flocks by night,  
They saw a bright new shining star,  
They heard a choir sing,  
The music seemed to come from afar,  
  
(Verse 2)  
Now, Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Come to bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
(Verse 3)  
By and by, they find a little nook,  
In a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark,  
Mary's litlle Boy was born!

And she singing

He met a young girl, who suited him nice.  
He went to his Papa to ask his advice.  
His Papa said: Son, I have to say no,  
That girl is your sister, but your Mama don't know!  
  
Woe is me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
Woe, it worries me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
  
A week went by, the summer came down,  
Soon another girl on the island he found.  
He went to his Papa to name the day.  
His Papa shook his head and this time he did say:  
You can't marry this girl, have to say no,  
That girl is your aunty, but your granny don't know! Hey!  
  
Woe is me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
Woe, it worries me. Shame and scandal in the family!

When your hair's undone  
And your guard's let down  
When you're all alone in your all nightgown

Sitting by yourself, again  
Where are you in the other hours  
Are you in a secret place that calls  
When you're by yourself with in your walls  
Are you undressed with someplace to go  
Off to catch your private show  
Why do you greet the morning  
Draping your heart in a shroud  
Why must your life be a sideshow  
Played to an ignorant crowd  
How are you, in the other hours  
Do you pray for morning to arrive  
Do you wonder how you can stay alive  
Are you at peace in a troubled mind  
Hoping no one else would find  
You're only playing dumb  
'til the other hours come  
[piano]  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Turning your face from the light  
Clearly you're turning to something  
That are revealed by the night  
What are you in the other hours  
Are you queen of some abandoned song  
Thinking how your crown of jewels had shone  
You're sitting there with no one to reign  
You think no one sees your pain  
And no one hears your drum  
So the other hours come

Really do come true.  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star and  
Wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney tops.  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere, over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow,  
Why then - oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,

The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

I'd use my word and all would say, ""There goes a clever gent""  
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me  
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

A mule is an animal with long, funny ears  
He kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny and his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak

His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He's got no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig

To fool all the people is his only thought  
Though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo

So you see, it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are

To get hold of me

Touching me in the night

Are tearing me up inside

If some woman turns your eye  
I pull you back in my direction  
Too keep you by my side  
  
You don't have to go nowhere  
To get where you should be  
You don't have to look around  
Just you look at me - look at me - look at me

Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat  
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride  
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while  
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain  
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight  
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will you want me too  
All I want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well  
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily  
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note  
I told him I am the flower you are the seed  
We walked in the garden we planted a tree  
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare  
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
Oh, oooh, we made love  
Love like strangers  
All night long  
We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes  
I said please, please understand  
I'm in love with another man  
And what he couldn't give me  
was the one little thing that you can  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Come on, say you will, you want me too

He was staring her right back, staring her right back  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
She made herself a local scene  
And man that axe could sing and scream  
Crying for a big breakthrough  
Only small time local news  
Just about to pack it in

Paid the way and broke the band  
A living one night stand, living one night stand

I cannot give you My fortune's set in stone

How beautiful the falling snow It hushes all the world And heals a melancholy
heart  
How beautiful, how beautiful The candle in the window It dances and it swirls  
How beautiful the snow tonight How beautiful the world How beautiful,
beautiful  
  
Da da da da's For some, the table's laden Others are denied Makes my love run
deeper  
When I see how hard you try And just like you, the snow falls Silent in the
night

Heart,How Deep It Goes,/h/heart/how+deep+it+goes_20064748.html,"In the quiet afternoon you left and went down into town  
And I just watched the empty road behind you  
Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside  
You want to be sleeping, deep inside  
Believing that the hungry world won't find you  
  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
What I believe anymore  
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay  
Or what I can say  
To make you know  
How deep it goes  
  
Somebody turned on the dirty blues  
I know you don't like the blues  
Cause the words are always the same  
And they kind of remind you  
Somebody turned the blues on me  
I don't like the blues cause I can't see  
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you  
  
Come on down  
Come on down  
You've got to come lay down here and say those things  
Those warm things, right here in my ear  
The times that you had that water like wine  
So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
If I could leave anymore, even though there's a scar  
Still fresh from the war, don't think about it no more  
Letting new love flow  
How deep it goes

Licking on a silver spoon  
Think you gotta buy all your friends  
Just so you can tear up the room  
Your kind is a dime a dozen  
I've seen it all before  
A parasite in a good disguise  
Just another wolf at the door

The wolf  
Prowling in the nighttime  
The wolf  
Howling in the moonshine  
The wolf  
Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine  
  
You lay it on oh, so sweet  
Just like that bad cologne  
Just smiling tooth and nail  
You gotta make your presence known  
But you are only a lonely hunter  
Some things you can't disguise  
Just to look in the hallway mirror  
Now it's howling in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silent, slick and stealthy  
Slinking through your evils nights  
You can see in the dark they tell me  
The daylight burns your eyes  
I know you're trying to track me down now  
You're right on my trail  
Your think you're going for the big big game  
But you're chasing your own tail

That it wasn't so tough  
To forget her name

Heart,These Dreams,/h/heart/these+dreams_20064760.html,"Spare a little candle  
Save some light for me  
Figures up ahead  
Moving in the trees  
White skin in linen  
Perfume on my wrist  
And the full moon that hangs over  
These dreams in the mist  
  
Darkness on the edge  
Shadows where I stand  
I search for the time  
On a watch with no hands  
I want to see you clearly  
Come closer than this  
But all I remember  
Are the dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
Is it cloak n dagger  
Could it be spring or fall  
I walk without a cut  
Through a stained glass wall  
Weaker in my eyesight  
The candle in my grip  
And words that have no form  
Are falling from my lips  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
There's something out there  
I can't resist  
I need to hide away from the pain  
There's something out there  
I can't resist  
  
The sweetest song is silence  
That I've ever heard  
Funny how your feet  
In dreams never touch the earth  
In a wood full of princes  
Freedom is a kiss  
But the prince hides his face  
From dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Far away from any burden

Headless into a new sensation  
Weather brain nor fear or patience  
Careless we had a game to play  
You crossed my way for twenty days  
Why don't you just heal  
The yearning that I feel?  
Hey, what we called a game  
Is more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
'Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
'Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain  
  
We're different colours, different nature  
Both we were like pupil and teacher  
It's a puzzle with two pieces  
Still not done 'cause one still misses  
Helpless I go through unknown stages  
A chapter of life which has missing pages  
Torture's not only physical  
It pains unbound  
Way, way down

By now I learned to take it cool, but I don't want to know  
  
My head is empty, all the stories that I've known I've told  
The situation I escaped from, now it looks like gold  
  
Anyway and anyhow we did it, it was good  
But now I take the time to think 'bout ev'rything I should  
  
'Cause after this I'm gone, the show is done  
No other town or bed that lies ahead  
I'll go home to what I know  
I'll go home, home to you  
  
By the time that you think 'bout it twice no spotlight makes you stay  
By the time that you feel you don't know, you have to go  
  
The plane is ready in my head, so many things to do  
A few more hours till it's over I reach out for you  
  
A kind of peace inside is growing, thinking 'bout the shows  
Until the next time I'll be so much better, yes I know  
  
Now this is it I'm gone, the show is done  
No other town or bed that lies ahead  
I'll go home to what I know  
I'll go home, home to you  
  
I'll go home

Helloween,How Many Tears,/h/helloween/how+many+tears_20065167.html,"A lot of things occur each day  
We've got to live with on our way  
There's so much misery on the screen  
With commercials in between  
  
And the Russians won't be so late  
Uncle Sam don't want to wait  
No matter if you're black or white  
You never ever had a right  
  
And look up to the eternal skies  
See warfare even there  
What once has been a paradise  
Now destruction and despair  
  
In other worlds the children die  
Lacking food ill from a fly  
Oppressed by troops to tame their land  
It's all the same again  
  
If any man is free on earth  
Then tormentors steal his birth  
They slam gun butts in his face  
And leave his woman choked in mace  
  
So stand up for our human rights  
Push back this pest of hate  
Raise you voice pass on the light  
Unite! it's not too late

How many tears flow away  
To become a sea of fears  
How many hearts are torn apart  
Till another torment starts  
  
But before the world  
Turns into a sun  
All cruelty and violence  
On earth will be dead and gone  
  
So stand up for our human rights  
Push back this pest of hate  
Raise you voice pass on the light  
Unite! it's not too late

You just go on and on in the back of my mind

To the other side of the sea

Evolution, revolution are the parents of one another  
Moving ever moving crushing everything that gets in it's way  
Smiles telling lies about the future  
I don't want to believe them  
Pity on their faces baby  
Don't you think they laugh in your face  
Wheels of justice they have fallen off  
Man's on crutches being kicked like dogs  
It's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut  
  
Politicians makin' money all the time  
They murder our freedom  
Filling up their pockets while the people in the street lay and die  
Man you're working hard as hell  
You only end up payin' more taxes  
Give 'em all your money baby  
Don't you think they give you a bomb  
Lambs were slaughtered for the sacrifice  
Man's now offered up by his own kind  
  
Cry for your soul, young and old, help your own  
They will need it, heed it  
Don't be caught between the stones  
  
Economic pressure and recession in a nation of madness  
Living under fear of countries launching up a nuclear attack  
Men are killing men with paper bullets  
You may wonder how that's done  
Money is the bullet and the dirty greedy heart is the gun  
  
It's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut  
Rise or fall, one and all, sink or swim  
We can win now, oh how we can do it if we try  
  
Superpowers playing chess along a board with people as pieces  
Taking human life just like they're only sacrificing a pawn  
Don't you know the game is rigged  
The best that they will do is a stalemate  
Who will be the judge of what is right  
When we are lying in graves  
We'll inherit from all of our nations  
Not peace, only deadly radiation  
It's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut, it's a juggernaut

Ragged after fights

For the lords of the dark

To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

For this whole world's in devil's hand  
Disease, disease, disease my friend

With his high iron voice causing sickness  
He is playing you out with delight

A silly bum with seven stars  
Don't throw the key or you will see  
Dimensions cruel as they can be""  
  
Don't let him suck off your power  
Throw the key...!  
  
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground  
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!  
  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
You locked up the Seven Seas  
And the Seer of Visions can now rest in peace  
There ain't no more demons and no more disease  
And mankind, live up, you're free again  
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown

Helloween,Midnight Sun,/h/helloween/midnight+sun_20065128.html,"Tried so hard to understand all of your feelings  
Tried to cope with your insanities  
Come to think about too many ways of healing  
What we lost or maybe never had  
  
One small step into the hidden decoy  
One more world is help and one will destroy  
  
I woke up in the midnight sun  
So aware damage has been done  
Agony or sanctuary  
Only fate will show the way  
  
From the bright of day into the jaw of darkness  
One is shoved, a victim of lie  
Friendly face turns into a fiery grimace  
Suddenly feelings learn to die  
  
Used up sympathy no chance to return  
To a world one know but would's that will burn  
  
Spent more time in the midnight sun  
Still aware of what else has gone  
Agonized and hypnotized  
When will I be shown the way  
  
Fell asleep and no midnight sun  
Still aware justice has been done  
No more doubts but disbelief  
When the night was day  
Celebration, miracle  
And fate did show the way

And memory fades  
I gaze at the photos  
A look in the haze  
You cannot imagine  
How many friends I've lost

For calling them back  
  
Music is like a sunrise for me  
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine  
Music is like a sunrise for me  
It's like coming home  
  
I was always insecure  
Sometimes I still am  
But I made up my mind now  
And look here I stand  
I ask myself sometimes:  
  
Is it all worth it?  
To fly over mountains  
Makes you fall down again  
  
But music

Silent pain  
Silence covers shame  
Lying colours  
Lurking Bane

Somewhere in her smile she knows

Something in her style that shows me

You're asking me will my love grow  
I don't know, I don't know  
You stick around and it may show

Something in the things she shows me

Tighten your belt and lets go  
Standing in line to get to the fairground  
Heading to the wicked side  
One way ticket, there is no returning  
Leave your soul at the gates  
  
Out of doubt, no hope  
Satan feeds our madness  
Insanity confirms where we stand  
Spit the red vile breath and  
Wrath is our gift that  
Leads direct to armageddon

Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down  
Take a spin on the dark ride  
May too far from the other side  
  
Step inside and take this final journey  
Your fantasies will come true  
Inclination without liberation  
Lifes carousel is catching you  
  
Even through the darkest phase  
Be it thick or thin  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
Driven to our final fate  
Jump out of this game

Why we came about  
Was it for love?  
Or to let sin abound  
Isn't it a wonder  
Awake from blood thick dreams  
Remove all the stones from our hearts  
We must all believe  
  
Ohhh, will we find a way to the other side  
Heading for a light  
Who is holding the key, why can't we see  
The dark ride  
  
I force the engine of your deadly sins  
Even through the darkest phase  
Be it thick or thin  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
I know too well you'll follow me, you follow me down

Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree

You hear and you agree  
  
We're all here for a reason  
So we can't just hang around  
There's so much left to see and learn  
Make way for common ground  
  
And those who head the wrong way  
Will rate as minor class  
As castaways they'll render fools  
When the horsemen come to rule  
  
Strike the last hour in their glass towers  
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall

The silver saxophones say I should refuse you  
The cracked bells and washed-out horns  
Blow into my face with scorn

Upon the street where mothers weep  
The saviours who are fast asleep  
They wait for you  
And I wait for them to interrupt  
Me drinkin from my broken cup  
And askin me to open up the gate for you

Oh, so bad

True love they've been without it  
But all their daughters put me down  
'Cause I don't think about it

He spoke to me, I took his flute  
No, I wasn't very cute to him now was I

Because he took you for a ride  
And because time was on his side  
And because I want you, baby I want you

Pretty soon he'll venture

of somebody I know?

back to reality.  
Don't you just pity me?  
I could so easily stay here.

Leave the bridge and captain's walking

Oh lord, look at the mess I'm in

So I waited for a shuttle bus  
It never came, instead, I got the rain...  
  
I broke a heel, I chipped a nail  
I lost the dog, How could I feel?  
On days like these, on days like these...  
  
The last thing I need is you,

Making a bad day worse  
What are you, a curse?

The last thing I need, is...

Oh yeah, laugh at the mess I'm in  
Hey hey, what a triple odd place to be  
The doctor says, that it's not good for me.  
  
I broke a tooth, I tore my shirt  
I lost the zip of my favorite skirt  
Then you told me... that I was a bore in bed.  
  
The last thing I need is you,  
And your black and white views

Making a bad day worse

All by itself  
Creatures jumped from  
The highest shelf  
Until I touched string 12  
This magnificent tree  
Appeared in my mind  
Even without leaves

Synthesized gnomes

Horrible Histories,Australia Song,/h/horrible+histories/australia+song_21080054.html,"[Verse 1]  
In Britain's Georgian times  
There were so many crimes  
No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony  
Cos there's no room to jail you  
They'd send you to Australia  
To live in our new-fangled penal colony  
Think that sounds like heaven?  
In 1787, it wasn't that kind of once in a lifetime trip  
First fleet took the journey  
Months at sea so churny  
Over 40 died while they were on the ship  
  
[Chorus]  
Those that lived were plucky  
Plucky, plucky, plucky  
Crammed on board with rats and vermin, cockroaches in bed  
Stench inside was sicky  
Yucky, yucky, icky  
Lice not very nice, can't get them out of my head  
  
[Verse 2]  
Landed Bay of Botany  
Convicts' life was rotteny  
Needed food and shelter but everything failed  
Threes too strong for felling  
Stagnant water smelling  
A real step back in time in New South Wales  
Soil too poor for budding  
Huts washed up by flooding  
Plans for building houses came to sticky ends  
The best of all their labours  
Attacked by local neighbours  
And that is when your neighbours don't become good friends  
  
[Chorus]  
Situation tricky  
Tricky, tricky, tricky  
Then a second fleet of ships was due aground  
Some thought this was lucky  
But illness had strucky  
Half were dead or I'll  
Fever was spinning around  
  
[Verse 3]  
After seven years  
Convict record clears  
Just one catch  
You got to pay your own way back  
No wages meant no money  
No choice, but what's funny  
Many stayed, became farmers and made a stack  
Original arrivers  
Proved hardy survivors  
Sydney turned into a place you'd choose to go  
Think that they'd be fairer  
To convicts who were sent there?  
No way they built prisons even more remote  
  
[Verse 4]  
Port Arthur was one of the jails  
Where every escape attempt fails  
Was one man who nearly got through  
Billy Hunt dressed as a kangaroo  
  
[Chorus]  
Inmate's life still sucky  
Sucky, sucky, sucky  
Life behind bars was not very nice  
Hideous and messy  
Who would ever guessy  
This hellhole would become a  
Holiday paradise?

My momma says I must wait here  
Until the moon is bright  
With cakes, milk and honey as gifts for the Gods  
Or as snack food for Mr. Right  
  
Now crawl around three times  
On your hands and knees  
And if the face of a handsome man comes into view  
Then he's your caveman love

Is all I'd hoped he would be  
He likes to go out hunting  
Then I cook it for his tea  
  
I promise to love him forever  
Until he's old and grey  
He'll live to the grand age of thirty  
At which point he'll probably pass away  
  
But that doesn't mean you stop loving him  
'Cause now you have to prepare  
A burial to show how much you care  
For your caveman love  
  
First I set fire to my husband  
Then carefully cut off his skin  
Boil in a pot some oysters and snakes  
Let the funeral begin  
Drop in some limpets and winkles  
And sprinkles of mouse, toad and shrew  
Then put out the fire with the cauldron  
And say au revoir to my caveman love

It's important that we mention  
A special race who really were unique

Plato and Pythagoras  
Both of them did stagger us  
Socrates, he showed such great technique

Mmmm yeah.  
Mmmm yeah.  
  
[Verse 1]  
People thought all animals  
Arrived here unrelated  
The world began, and then came man  
All perfectly created  
  
[Verse 2]  
But then someone looked up a tree.  
And said ""That monkey looks just like me!""  
So it really was a mystery  
What I'd learned in natural history!  
  
[Verse 3]  
So I joined HMS Beagle  
Watched the eagle and the seagull  
We studied rock and plants  
Flowers, trees and bees and ants  
  
[Verse 4]  
Slept on hammocks without pillows  
Eating rats and armadillos  
Till I realised on reflec-tion  
It's natural selection! Yeah!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Natural selection means  
Each animal evolved  
To blend with its surroundings  
Ch-ch-changes were involved  
  
[Verse 6]  
So birds with different, foods to seek.  
Seem to have developed, different beaks.  
  
[Verse 7]  
And over time they'd,  
Modified  
So just the fittest  
Of them all survived!  
  
[Verse 8]  
On the Isles of Galapagos  
I noted the giant tortoise  
Had interesting shells  
And I rode on them as well  
  
[Verse 9]  
Iguanas land and swimming  
Meant my new theory was winning  
It all led in the direction  
Of natural selection.  
  
[Verse 10]  
My findings went with outrage  
From the ch-ch-ch-ch-church of England  
And from me.  
  
[Verse 11]  
The idea that we came from ch-ch-chimps  
Questioned my own Christianity  
But it was hard to disagree!  
  
[Verse 12]  
Every species new mutation  
Had a perfect explanation  
It seems the worlds inception  
Must predate common perception  
  
[Verse 13]  
And if lack of adaptation  
Means a fatal limitation  
So each creature's imperfection

Grow unique means of protection  
And to fail nature's inspection  
Means immediate rejection

Of natural selection!

Horrible Histories,Norman Family Tree,/h/horrible+histories/norman+family+tree_21067102.html,"[Intro]  
Here's the tale of me, Matilda,  
And my fight with cousin Stephen to succeed  
Henry first's throne.  
My wife's also called Matilda,  
Quite confusing 'cause we choose to claim  
Matilda's throne as our own.  
I'm Henry that Matilda's son.  
You got that?  
Here's the story of our spat.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Starts in 1135, when king Henry, my father, died,  
And I think you'll find named me, Matilda, as his heir.  
But his nephew, Stephen, said  
That crown should be upon my head!  
I'm a man and men come first.  
What? It's only fair.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Had married Geoffrey of Anjou,  
Stuck in France not Waterloo.  
When Steve without a voulez vous,  
Took throne from me.  
Should be dancing queen.  
Oh stop causing such a scene!  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown and take a chance on me,  
I'm heir to the throne not you! Ah-ha!  
Think you'll get it back,  
Now that I'd like to see!  
  
Oh, I do, I do, I do!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Fought in Lincoln,  
She caught me.  
Was proclaimed first English Lady.  
But she made many enemies.  
Remember me? I'm Stephens wife.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Made royal councilors agree,  
That she lacked femininity.  
Took Stephens army and besieged her.  
Eugh! More strife!  
  
[Verse 5]  
I was trapped so faked my death!  
Hid in coffin, held my breath.  
Escaped!  
You think that I'm impressed?  
Well I'm not.  
Just look who I've got,  
Your half brother, want to swap?  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme hubby and we'll fight again.  
The winner takes it all. Ah-ha!  
In Oxford I'll besiege,  
And I'll escape and then,  
I'll join the battle call.  
  
[Verse 6]  
Age 14, I fought but lost,  
So Uncle Stephen stayed as boss.  
Who should be ruler, mamma? Mia!  
Here we go again.  
  
[Verse 7]  
Sadly my darling Matilda,  
Caught a fever and it killed her.  
I gave up my dream  
To build a royal dynasty.  
When my son died,  
Had no heir which was a bind.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown 'cause next in line it's me.  
You can have it when I'm done. Ah-ha!  
So Empress Matilda never did make queen.  
The throne went to my son.  
  
Knowing Mum, knowing you.  
Everybody happy? Good!

Horrible Histories,Suffragettes,/h/horrible+histories/suffragettes_20986756.html,"We are the suffragettes,  
Think you know some fierce girls?  
You ain't heard nothing yet.  
  
A lass called Milli Fawcett, founder of our cause,  
Started the battle for our rights  
Argued the government should change the laws,  
Here is how she stated our plight  
  
How come girls can't vote for rules that we have to obey?  
When we work and pay taxes too!  
Parliament's reaction was  
'Oh do go away! '  
How dare they diss the suffrage crew  
  
Suffragettes sing, we're gonna do this thing  
Peaceful protest started in 1903  
Got no reaction, needed drastic action  
Got a new leader Emmeline Pankhurst  
That's me  
  
Burst into parliament shouting ""votes for women"",  
Actions though were shocking and new  
Chained ourselves to palace gates  
Tension was brimming on the WSPU  
Burned down churches, smashed up shops  
Attacked mps, the result we were thrown in gaol  
This made us more determined as you'll come to see  
Think we'd give up fighting? Hey fail!  
  
Suffragettes sing together we can win  
In prison we protested and went on hunger strike  
Men still said no but we just said Yo!  
You won't stop us now!  
Miss Davison please take the mic  
  
We became more extreme  
Derby day June 13  
In front of king and queen  
Committed sacrifice supreme  
Crept unseen between the team  
And crowds watching the race  
And threw myself under a horse  
To try and make our case  
Became a famous martyr, how did men react?  
We can't give women votes if they're so stupid they'll do that  
  
Seemed our cause was lost  
When world war came along  
Our suffragette reaction  
Was to wave our protest good bye  
Farewell, so long, took patriotic action  
Put down our banner saying give us votes  
Instead supported the men's fight  
Worked to help them win the war so guess what they said  
Okay ladies... You were right!  
  
Suffragettes sing, we've done it ding-ding  
At last those men could see they should treat us the same  
So all take note now that women can vote  
And it's thanks to those who fought in the  
Suffragette name!

Through the market square,  
With our funny,  
Clothes and hair.  
  
Aristotle and Socrates,  
Plato and Diogenes,  
Four fab scholars,  
With our Greek philosophies.  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're the Thinkers,  
Wondering what,  
Life is for.  
  
We're paid to,  
Try and think up,  
The answer  
To that and more.  
  
People found me irritating  
Thanks to my interrogating  
Like a toddler, was always asking why.  
  
What is wisdom, what is beauty  
What is nature, what is duty  
Taught everything I know to  
This next guy.  
  
I'm Plato, was his pupil thinker  
Ended up with inky fingers  
Writing every word he taught me  
Down.  
  
Also had my own theory  
Like for everything that we see  
There's a perfect version  
To be found. Ooh!  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're The Thinkers,  
Mega brainy  
Ancient Greeks  
  
We're always  
Busy thinking  
Cause the truth is  
What we seek.  
  
My name is Diogenes  
I'm not one to say thanks or please  
Poked statues and walked barefoot  
In the snow.  
  
Never believed in possessions  
Thought they gave the wrong impression  
Put faith in total freedom  
Don't you know.  
  
I studied at Plato's academy  
Taught Alex the Great, I know everything me,  
Intrigued by the world  
Wanted to show it all.  
  
I took all their theories higher  
Discovered water, ether, earth, air and fire  
Learned every science  
I'm Mr Know-It-All!  
  
Hey, hey  
We're The Thinkers  
Very witty  
Very wise  
  
No one  
Can out-wink us  
We are Athens'  
Brainiest guys.  
  
Not everyone likes smarties though  
Even Socrates had his foe  
When tried for treason  
He simply said ""Why?""  
  
They sentenced him to drink hemlock  
He said ""You know if I take stock  
I am annoying, I'll take that  
And die. ""  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're The Thinkers  
Politicians  
Gave us strife  
  
But we don't  
Give a tinkers

All about life.

My Grandad Henry Seventh,  
He beat King Richard,  
That's him pictured,  
Defeating the Tyke.

He liked his name so much that,  
To keep alive is memory,  
He called his own son Henry,  
What was he like!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Everyone said Hen-er-y the eighth was a baddy,  
I have to agree,  
Even though he was my daddy.

Cos we're Tudors,  
Britain's biggest feuders,  
And just like barracudas,  
We kill with methods foul.  
  
Tudors  
Each enemy a Judas,  
At least we're not as rude as,  
Simon Cowell.  
  
[Verse 4]  
My reign was quite notorious,  
I liked to hunt and slaughter,  
But then you had a daughter,  
Mary was her name,  
It was a son I wanted,  
So I divorced her mother,  
Then wife two had another,  
A girl? Not again!

Yes sicky little Eddie,  
Was I'll and soon got deady

Your daughters then took over,  
First came Bloody Mary,  
My sisters rule was scary,  
So all hail meeeeeee

Tudors,  
The history books reviewed us,  
As nutters and big bruisers,  
Who kill and cull.

So our reign ended there,  
We my not have been fair,  
But we were never dull

It pulled a train that carried passengers and was the first of its kind

We took some steel and a wheel  
Made a plane, car and train and created a revolution

Transport was duller, we added colour

My life was a mystery  
Some say born twelve seven two  
Some say twelve sixty three  
  
Was dubbed Malcolm of Paisley  
Maybe Alan from Aire  
Did I have a wife or no?  
Do you really care?  
  
They say I had a big, red beard  
But all you need to know  
I was a Scottish rebel  
And the English were my foe  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
This is war I cried!  
Many English fought me  
And many English died!  
  
I took against the English  
Back when I was fairly wee  
'Cause an Englishman called Selby  
Bullied my whole family  
It upset me, so I struck him dead  
Well, wouldn't you?  
Then an English sheriff came along  
Guess what, I killed him too!  
  
They say he killed my wife  
So he deserved what he got  
Then England's King Ed came for me  
Ooh, I'm scared! Not!  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
Possibly six feet seven  
But all that really matters is  
I sent Englishmen to heaven!  
  
Forty thousand English came  
To Stirling Bridge for me  
They had to cross a narrow bridge  
To get to us, you see  
We held them off, pushed them back  
It was no contest  
Bridge collapsed, hundreds drowned  
Of course I killed the rest!  
  
I celebrated Stirling Bridge  
Another Scottish win  
By decorating my sword  
With the English general's skin  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
Scottish legend too  
Fought for Scottish freedom  
Was a hero through and through  
  
Here's where my rebel story comes unstuck  
At Falkirk defeated, I'd run out of luck  
Spent seven years playing hide and seek  
Captured, sent to London, tried for treason  
What a cheek!  
  
King Ed hanged me, then a lovely touch  
Pulled my guts out, guess he didn't like me much!  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
In Scotland my heart lived  
Though sadly, my head wound up  
On a spike on London Bridge!  
  
Ooh, that smarts!
