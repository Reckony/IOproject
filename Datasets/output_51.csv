In East Berlin, ow-ooo  
  
She had a very bad affair  
With some cat from Hiroshima  
She turned into a head of lettuce  
She eats Thorazine in her farina

Now she's hanging out

And everytime I eat vegetables  
It makes me think of you  
And everytime I eat vegetables  
I don't know what to do, to do ow-ooo

I am not afraid of life  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag  
And I wonder is life a drag  
  
I am not afraid of pain  
But it hurts so bad  
I feel so mad  
No one see the truth  
There's nothing to gain  
A life goes down the drain  
Don't want to die at an early age  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see a street crazy shivering with cold  
Is it a crime to be old  
  
There's the threat of the nuclear bomb  
We know it's wrong  
We know it's wrong  
Is there a chance for peace  
Will the fighting ever cease  
Mankind's almost out of luck  
A maniac could blow us up  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I get down on my knees and I pray  
Is there hope for the world today

And from a jail came the wail  
Of a down-hearted frail  
And they played that as part of the blues  
  
From a whippoorwill out on a hill  
They took a new note  
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note

And I'm sure you'll make a lovely bride  
And he loves you, any fool can plainly see

All alone with the future mister me

And holding things together

For you could turn to me for help  
And I could turn to you  
And jealousy was something  
That never entered our hearts  
For we were made for one another  
No matter where we are

Randy Travis,I'm Ready,/r/randy+travis/im+ready_20262543.html,"All our days are numbered  
Some live on borrowed time  
But life is what you make it  
Thank God I was so inclined  
To accept my Lord and Savior  
When the good news sunk in  
He paid a heavenly price  
By giving His life  
And I can't wait to go home to Him  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
When there's no tomorrow  
And glory has come down  
Those without Jesus  
Are lost and never to be found  
So please listen when I'm talking  
I'm just saying what needs to be said  
Make plans while your still living  
It's too late when your dead  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
Oh, once this old world sets me free

And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time  
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall  
Just how the dream went  
And all but this broken heart in me I guess is doing fine

Is it still over, are we still through  
Since my phone still ain't ringing I assume it still ain't you  
I've half a mind to take the time to find somebody new  
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you  
  
That lie that I tried to slip by you  
Was told with good intentions  
It was just another way to say I love you  
And protect you from the truth  
Half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention  
And trying to explain while I'm insane  
Is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do

If I repeat myself it's cause I've nothing else to do  
And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

Riding down old two mile hill  
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars  
Paying no mind to the passing cars  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here  
  
[Chorus]  
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall  
No net, just you to catch me when I fall  
Look heart, no hands.  
  
It took a little time to get up to speed  
To find the confidence and strength I need  
To just let go and reach for the sky  
You Know sometimes it felt I could fly.  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here.

It doesn't take much, just a smile or a touch  
And I'm a kid again, I can almost feel that wind  
  
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me, all night long.  
So many lover's games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But on the other hand, there's a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else

Some are running too  
Some are running blind

Which one are you

You don't know me from Adam

I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out  
How can you be so sure my dear what I'm all about

I can tell your cash or credit  
I can tell your brand of beer  
  
I can tell you who's a liar  
And the truth is plain to see  
That's your last twenty boy  
and don't you lie to me  
  
Theirs a girl  
In Albuquerque crying (ain't she)  
And your standing in a quick shop

Said you know what to do  
If you drive it steady son  
You'll be home this afternoon

Rascal Flatts,Backwards,/r/rascal+flatts/backwards_20450473.html,"I was sittin' on a bar stool  
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee  
When this old boy walked in  
And he sat right down next to me  
  
I could tell he'd been through some hard times  
There were tear stains on his old shirt  
And he said, ""You wanna know what you get  
When you play a country song backwards?""  
  
You get your house back  
You get your dog back  
You get your best friend Jack back  
You get your truck back  
  
You get your hair back  
You get your first and second wives back  
Your front porch swing  
Your pretty little thing  
  
Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring  
You get your farm, and the barn  
And the boat, and the Harley  
First night in jail with Charlie  
  
It sounds a little crazy  
A little scattered and absurd  
But that's what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
  
Well, I never heard it said quite like that  
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at  
I almost fell flat out on the floor  
He said, ""Wait a minute, that's not all  
There's even more.""  
  
You get your mind back  
You get your nerves back  
Your first heart attack back  
You get your pride back  
  
You get your life back  
You get your first real love back  
You get your big screen TV, a DVD  
And a washing machine  
  
You get the pond, and the lawn  
And the bail, and the mower  
You go back where you don't know her  
It sounds a little crazy  
  
A little scattered and absurd  
But that's what you get  
When you play a country song backwards

We sat there and shot the bull  
About how it would be  
If we could turn it all around

Trapped in the past for too long  
I'm moving on  
  
I've lived in this place  
And I know all the faces  
Each one is different  
But they're always the same  
They mean me no harm  
But it's time that I face it  
They'll never allow me to change  
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong  
I'm moving on  
  
I'm moving on  
At last I can see  
(Last I can see)  
Life has been patiently waiting for me  
And I know there's no guarentees  
But I'm not alone  
There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all you can see are the years passing by  
(The years passing by)  
And I have made up my mind  
That those days are gone  
  
I sold what I could  
And packed what I couldn't  
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town  
I've loved like I should  
But lived like I shouldn't  
I had to lose everything to find out  
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on

And Joey had never seen one  
Real cowboy all dressed up  
As he held it in his hand  
Said, ""You be good and I'll be bad""  
Then he pulled the trigger back  
Stopped little Tommy in his tracks  
And said, ""Get up, man""  
People came from miles to say goodbye  
To the Wilson's youngest son  
His innocent life had just begun

It's not intended to end that way  
Life is a journey constantly turning  
Down an unknown path  
But it's not supposed to go like that

And the keys to Jenny's heart  
A fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  
Almost gone  
Havin' the time of their life  
Had only one thing on their mind  
Never saw the flashin' lights  
Or the train comin' on  
Now there's a wreath and two small crosses  
On the right side of the road  
Reminders of a love that won't grow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wonder if guardian angels cry  
When they see it all played out  
And as they stand with their hands tied  
Oh, do they cry out loud

Standing beside her the stars shined even brighter  
And for a moment all the world was, all the world was still  
I knew we belonged together the moment my eyes met hers  
And I thought nothing last forever, but maybe this one will  
  
A deep breath and baby steps

The world starts to spin again, you learn things you didn't know then  
Feels like the bloom is off the rose  
But you weather a few storms and you pull out a few thorns  
And together the garden grows and grows

To find the tiny King

Without your holy light  
They would still be searching

And she shot a look my way  
And I stood right up  
And I said, Teacher  
There's something  
That I've got to say  
You know the grass below is green  
And the sky above is blue  
And Columbus found this country  
In 1492  
You need to stand up  
And be counted  
You've got to raise your hand  
And just let them call your name  
You've got to stand up  
If you want to be counted

He's looking for someone  
Who's gonna stand up  
For the Church  
And he wants you to stand up  
On the street  
And where you go to school  
And where you go to work  
And in a world filled with darkness

What are we doing here?  
Should we pack our bags  
The moment we're forgiven?  
Oh, there's a world  
That needs to know  
Jesus loves them so  
His commission seems quite clear  
What are we doing here?  
They say we are pilgrims  
Just passing through  
Strangers in a strange land  
That's me and you  
One day we'll be up in glory  
Walking on streets of gold  
But right now my feet  
Are on the pavement  
And I just want to know  
Chorus  
I see a starving brother  
In a foreign land  
I see a homeless child  
Reaching out his hand  
I see a world so angry  
I can feel the rage  
I see a city dying  
Filled with crack cocaine  
I hear the lions roar  
The tires squeal  
A generation saying what is real  
If we know the truth  
If we know the way  
There ought to be something  
We can do or say  
We need to make a stand  
Take a walk  
Win this city,  
Do it block by block  
Stand up tall  
And preach it without fear  
If we won't do it  
Then what are we doing here?

Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Mark Pay  
He heard the preacher say  
A single dime can feed  
A hungry boy or girl  
With nothing to eat  
So he pulled a dollar  
From the pocket of his jeans  
And he asked his mama  
How many will this feed?  
She just smiled  
And when she told him ten  
He reached back again  
chorus:  
What if I give all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My child, a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
He didn't close his eyes  
Or turn away  
I can see him standing tall  
He saw the need  
And I can hear him say  
What if I give all  
Three birthday dollars  
Could have bought a special toy  
But he reminds me  
Of another little boy  
Who gave to Jesus  
A gift of fish and bread  
I wonder if he said  
chorus (repeat)  
And long ago a Father and a Son  
Saw the children lost in sin  
Can you see the tears  
In the Fathers eyes  
As Jesus says to him  
What if I gave all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My Son, that gift  
Will change the world  
It will free the multitudes  
What if I give all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My child a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
We cannot close our eyes  
And turn away  
When we hear His Spirit call  
We see the need  
Now let Him hear us say  
What if I give all?  
What if I give all?

Let the little children come to me,

Little children asking  
What was I supposed to be.  
Chorus  
What was I supposed to be,

Before I even drew a breath,  
Laid my head at my mother's breast,  
To sleep.

Used in the ministry,  
A doctor who would find a cure

Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
In a land far away  
A little boy lay  
Asleep in his bed  
Then he heard a voice call  
There was no doubt at all  
He knew just what it said  
He had heard it before  
And he could not ignore  
What he thought  
Was too good to be true  
For the words of a wise man  
Had opened his eyes  
And he knew what he needed to do  
chorus:  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just say, Lord, I am listening  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just be ready to obey  
For there's no greater joy  
Than hearing Him call your name  
Well, the little boy's gone  
But life still goes on  
Day after day  
And if God spoke back then  
He can do it again  
In a nuclear age  
Have you heard it before  
And just chose to ignore  
What your mind thought  
Was only a dream  
If He's speaking to you  
This is what you should do  
And it's not quite  
As strange as it seems

Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever  
And I was burning up inside  
My baby walked in my bedroom  
And I could hardly open my eyes  
She said she was going to the pawn shop  
Just across the track  
She started packing some clothes in a hurry  
And then she said she would be right back  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
I remember so well when she slammed the door  
But the girl didn't make it back no more  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I waited for her twenty four hours  
And I was just about to starve to death  
It didn't look like she was coming back  
So I had to look out for myself  
Well I called the police department  
To find out what they knew  
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet  
Because they were looking for her too.  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
Well I don't know what happened across the track  
But I know my baby didn't make it back  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Well I called my Dr. Foster  
And when the girl answered the phone  
I got a funny feeling  
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone  
She said he left with a lady patient  
About twenty four hours ago  
I added two and two and here's what I got  
I got I'll never see that girl no mo'  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
If Dr. foster has got her then I know I'm through

From the lips that you once fondly pressed  
But the world moves apace and the loves of today  
Flit away with a smile and a tear,

I only know that we should have parted  
I stole a kiss, and then another  
I didn't mean to take it further  
  
One mint julep was the cause of it all  
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor  
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father  
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter  
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""  
  
I didn't know just what I was doing  
I had to marry of face ruin

But from now on I?ll be thinking double  
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey

There was thunder from the throne  
And seven spanish angels  
Took another angel home  
  
She reached down and picked the gun up  
That lay smokin' in his hand  
Said, ""Father please forgive me  
I can't make it without my man""  
And she knew the gun was empty  
And she knew she couldn't win  
But her final prayer was answered  
When the rifles fired again  
  
[Chorus]

And the things that we used to do

Everything was fine, nothing never did go wrong

You gave the best love I ever had  
It's a doggone shame, 'cause it sure felt good to me  
Sometimes I wonder, where did you disappear to  
How did you get away, baby  
And I often think of you  
Do you ever think of me, baby  
Sometimes love don't work, the way you think it should  
When your love jones comes on down, baby

Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry  
Nothing's ever made me feel more alive  
That's why once again here I am  
Looking for the eyes of a new love  
  
I know that somewhere in this world tonight  
There's a guy  
(She goes high on this part and I have no clue what she says)  
I'd even look if I thought I might find a new love  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine

For this old heart of mine

At the Oaks Retirement Home  
But mostly, no one comes 'cept on the weekends  
Ruby Wilson lives in 303  
Where she spends most her time  
But it's almost noon on Sunday  
And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up  
With nowhere to go  
  
As Ruby watches all the others  
Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner  
She says she's expecting company  
They're just running late  
But, the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow

I'm a mother of lost causes. A sister of the road. I give my heart to a song,

right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones. But I can light
up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones. I'll still be my Mama's

it stays the same.

Cause this missing you ain't doing me no good

Right on the edge  
Just one step away from going insane  
But I'm not there yet  
If I could just lose my mind  
I wouldn't know we're through  
But this close to crazy  
Is far from over you  
  
Today I caught myself  
Reliving how it used to be  
At a table for two just you and me  
But talking to an empty chair  
And laughing right out loud  
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt  
I'm a broken woman close to breaking down

Reba Mcentire,Daddy,/r/reba+mcentire/daddy_20114506.html,"My daddy is a rancher  
He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life  
He also liked to rodeo  
He traveled around with four kids and a wife  
  
Well his old ranch is rocky  
But his ropes sail smooth for several years  
He worked real hard  
And roped real good  
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
He didn't want us kids to rodeo  
He wanted more out of life for us  
Maybe banking, or a lawyer  
Or maybe even driving some old bus  
  
Well that's when we took up singing  
And his pride grew greater day by day  
And I know his eyes grew misty  
The night I sang up on the Opry stage  
  
[Chorus]  
Now his ranch is so much bigger  
The the days when he first started  
The grass grows now where none used to be  
His roping got him started  
Cattle prices made it better  
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his  
Ropes  
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes  
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years  
Ago  
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now he's feeding cattle  
Toting hay  
And branding the Y.O.  
And his hired hand's there to help him  
And she also cooks their meals when they get home  
They built their ranch together  
And listening to the kids sing through the years  
  
Well they worked real hard  
And roped real good and now they got their ranch  
Out in the clear  
Because when a family works together  
They finally get their ranch out in the clear  
Out in the clear

Reba Mcentire,Fancy,/r/reba+mcentire/fancy_20114558.html,"I remember it all very well lookin' back  
It was the summer I turned eighteen  
We lived in a one room, rundown shack  
On the outskirts of New Orleans  
We didn't have money for food or rent  
To say the least we were hard pressed  
Then Mama spent every last penny we had  
To buy me a dancin' dress  
  
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair  
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin  
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip  
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good  
Standin' back from the lookin' glass  
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood  
  
She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
  
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck  
And she kissed my cheek  
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes  
When she started to speak  
She looked at a pitiful shack  
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath  
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick  
And the baby's gonna starve to death  
  
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said  
""To thine own self be true""  
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across  
The toe of my high heel shoe  
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'  
Askin' Mama what do I do  
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy  
And they'll be nice to you  
  
She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out  
Well it's up to you  
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown  
  
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma  
The night I left that rickety shack  
The welfare people came and took the baby  
Mama died and I ain't been back  
  
But the wheels of fate had started to turn  
And for me there was no way out  
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly  
What my Mama's been talkin' about  
  
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow  
That I's gonna be a lady someday  
Though I don't know when or how  
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life  
With my head hung down in shame you know  
I might have been born just plain white trash  
But Fancy was my name  
  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
  
It wasn't very long after a benevolent man  
Took me off the street  
And one week later I was pourin' his tea  
In a five room hotel suite  
  
I charmed a king, a congressman  
And an occasional aristocrat  
Then I got me a Georgia mansion  
In an elegant New York townhouse flat  
And I ain't done bad  
  
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite  
That would call me bad  
And criticize Mama for turning me out  
No matter how little we had  
  
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'  
For nigh on fifteen years  
I can still hear the desperation in my poor  
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear  
  
She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Lord, forgive me for what I do  
But if you want out well it's up to you  
Now don't let me down

A little old lady was prayin' to  
God She cried ""My son is gone""  
He's lost, he's lost, he's lost  
  
And suddenly she stopped praying  
And the tears dried from her eyes  
She said ""But God, how would you know  
Your heart has never been broken  
And God, You never cried""  
  
God turned His face towards the earth  
And covered it with His hands  
He said ""I must go and redeem my people  
And go in the form of a man""  
  
So He came to Earth a stranger  
Among His own people  
Came to live with man, came to understand  
The way of life  
Tears of strife were meant, for He was a man  
  
He grew to love His own creation  
And when His dearest friend died  
He knew the empty feeling of lonliness  
And at Lazurus' tomb, God cried  
  
And then came the day in the garden  
And pilots called Judgement Hall  
And there in the dark hills of Calvery  
Hanging between Earth and Heaven  
God wept and cried for them all  
For them all - for them all

He believes in the family unit  
The union of man and wife  
He believes that you stand before God  
For better, for worse and beyond this life  
  
He believes that a ring on his finger  
Is something to be proud of  
For all of the world to witness  
That he is committed to this love  
  
He wants to get married  
  
He'll build a house in the country  
Where he'll watch his children grow  
And teach them the values of something  
That most people never even know  
  
He wants to get married  
  
I never thought I would be so blessed  
To know a man like this  
He's everything, everything I believe that a man should be  
  
And when he is called to his maker  
He wants to go to his grave  
With his final remembrance of this earth  
To be one last look at his wife's face  
  
He wants to get married  
He wants to get married  
Oh, he wants to get married  
  
But not to me

Love that I've lived without finding

Sound as empty as the way you feel inside

Tells me everything that you deny

How to tell me goodbye

I wish that I could tell you

Do you hurt 'em with the truth or with a lie?  
Where do you go to find the courage  
You know I could never find?  
I don't know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
Where do you turn, where do you go?

And the couple's done sayin' I do

The length of the dress, the layers on the cake

Now she's feeling that there's something more  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there life out there  
So much she hasn't done  
Is there life beyond  
Her family and her home  
She's done what she should  
Should she do what she dares  
She doesn't want to leave  
She's just wonderin  
Is there life out there  
  
She's always lived for tomorrow  
She's never learned how  
To live for today  
She's dyin' to try something foolish  
Do something crazy  
Or just get away  
Something for herself for a change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place in the sun that she's never been  
Where life is fair and time is a friend  
Would she do it the same as she did back then  
She looks out the window and wonders again

Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world

Mama stood on the front porch ringin' her hands  
Watched the tail lights fadin' on his black tranzam  
With her precious little baby taking off inside  
Staring at him with stars in her eyes  
She tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf  
She wasn't gonna listen to a word she said  
Chorus  
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road  
With a boy lookin' like that  
He'll tell ya thangs that you wanna hear  
And they'll be no turnin' back  
There's an oak tree down by the lake  
In the shade where the wild flowers grow  
What'll happen only heaven knows  
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road  
(at the end)........don't go down....... Maggie Creek Road)  
Verse 2  
Was a still black night as dark is cold  
Nobody heard her when she said no  
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow  
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out  
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road  
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago  
chorus  
Verse 3  
Somehow mama's always know  
Cause they shoulda been home an hour ago  
When she pulled up it was just going down  
She turned her headlights off didn't make a sound  
She heard her baby crying no but he wouldn't stop  
Her heart went cold and her blood ran hot  
With a pistol in her hand she opened his door  
You don't wanna see mama go to war

The nurses saw an old woman cryin'  
But he saw the love of his life  
She don't know where she is  
But she knows this isn't home  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He met her in the summer of '37  
in a brush arbor down on the Rush Creek shore  
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile  
But she won him with her eyes  
  
All the years and children gone,  
he still sees her the same  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He woke up each morning and drove into town  
He stayed all day till her dinner came  
Then he took her to a room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker  
Covered her with a quilt she'd made  
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He said ""They tell me this is all that's left,  
Say this hell on Earth is best,  
I lost all those reasons and I still don't understand""  
He cursed his body old and weak  
Tears of failure burned his cheeks  
He said ""Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day""  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death  
When you fear the reaper night not come today  
The line 'em up in Laz-E-Boys out in the sunroom  
The TV keeps the quiet away  
She can't recall his name and she's the only love he's known  
Love is a hard, hard road  
Love is a hard, hard road  
Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done.

I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Swinging from the rope that's hanging free  
And I drop in to the waters  
And go swimming in the muddy Mississippi  
  
A boy came to the Delta  
And we would swing together from that tree  
I could see my dreams in his eyes  
As he held on to me  
  
Swinging in the sunlight  
Loving in the shadows  
Wild and free  
And I made him promise he would take me  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Bright lights of the city made my red dress and shoes look brand new  
While he worked the night shift  
I turned on and I turned loose  
I lost my pride I lost my man  
I did things a girl like me shouldn't do  
  
Now I can't face this living  
With the swelling signs of new life  
Showing through  
  
I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Hanging from the rope that's swinging free  
And I'll swing for the last time over the waters

For nobody but you  
I will be a lonley one if your to say were through  
  
And if you wanna make me cry that wont be so hard to do  
If your gonna say goodbye  
I will still go on loving you

Where the buffalo roam  
And the death of a race is a game  
Where seldom is heard  
  
A peaceable word  
From the white trash  
Who killed as they came  
Though these words dig deep  
They offer no relief  
God save the queen  
I am an Indian chief  
  
There is a secret I keep  
It's called the talking leaf  
And you better believe  
That he speaks his beliefs  
Like a rock that bleeds  
A sea of grief  
  
My talking leaf speaks of  
A wounded knee creek  
American ghost dance  
A new man who is with old ways  
He walks the streets of life  
  
But he's in chains  
I'm alive he cried  
I can feel the flame  
Burning red inside  
I am an Indian brave  
There is a memory  
  
That lives in my blood  
Of the brand you laid  
On all you touched  
But the burning flame  
Turns to burning pain  
Genuine genocide  
  
And that's truly insane  
So like a wild hurricane  
I will dance on the grave  
Of my race that died  
When it should have been saved

but something went wrong  
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
And so castles made of sand  
fall in the sea  
eventually  
There was a young girl  
whose heart was a frown  
'cause she was crippled for life  
and she couldn't speak a sound  
and she wished and prayed  
she could stop livin'  
so she decide to die  
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore  
and to her legs she smiled  
You won't hurt me no more  
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say  
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way  
And it really didn't have to stop  
It just kept on going  
And so castles made of sand  
slips into the sea  
eventually

Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  
Here, above land, man has laid his plan  
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan  
We got a government so twisted and bent  
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent  
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution  
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution  
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution  
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution  
And that's a heart felt shame  
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same  
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?  
Time now to take you to a different place  
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space  
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace  
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace  
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none  
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun  
No one tells 'em how their life is run  
And no one points at them with a gun  
They have a lot of love for every living creature  
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature  
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher  
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you  
Back to the land of the police man  
Where he does whatever he says he can  
Including hating you because you're a Jew  
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new  
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl  
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all  
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails  
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail  
So support your police, support your local wars  
That's the way to open economic doors  
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore  
We assume the position to sell the ammunition  
What the fuck? It's the american tradition  
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen

Any other day and I might play  
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae  
Why try and run away

Slow cheetah come  
Before my forest  
Looks like it's on today  
  
Slow cheetah come  
It's so euphoric  
No matter what they say  
  
I know a girl  
She worked in a store  
She knew not what  
Her life was for  
She barely knew her name  
  
They tried to tell her  
She would never be  
As happy as the girl  
In the magazine  
She bought it with her pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone has  
So much to say  
They talk talk talk  
Their lives away  
Don't even hesitate  
  
Walking on down  
To the burial ground  
It's a very old dance  
With a merry old sound  
Looks like it's on today

Being face to face with common grace  
To meditate on the warmest dream  
And when I walk alone I listen  
To our secret theme  
  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That can see right through  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
  
Sailin for the sun  
Cause there is one  
Knows where I'm from  
I care for you  
I really do, I really do  
  
Come closer now  
So you can lie  
Right by my side  
  
Sittin alone in the sun

Gettin over myself, yeah

Just another star  
Fallin in my yard

Long to be with  
Someone to tell

Aha  
You're my lollipop  
You're my lemondrop  
You're my sweet pea  
You're my queen bee

Like a ray of sunshine  
You're the kind of girl  
I wanna sport  
When I'm on a roller ride  
I'ts love I'm livin'  
All for you  
The first girl in my life  
That I'll always be true  
Some get jealous  
Of what we got  
But there's no way to stop  
All the feelings we got  
Just the little things  
That made me gig with you  
The way you look in my eyes  
The way you find the time  
The way you touch my hand  
When I'm not in demand  
The way you make me feel fine  
When I'm cryin' at night  
Paradise within my mind  
So i huff and I puff  
But you know I ain't trippin'  
I told you before that I'll only be livin'  
For the love of you, my boo  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love  
For the love of you girl  
All that I'm givin'  
Is for the love of you  
That's why everything I do  
I do for you  
Might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
That could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that  
I've done just about  
All that I can do  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
You ... you ... you ...  
Givin' ...  
Oooh ooh ooh ooh  
Driftin' on a mem'ry  
I wanna livin for your love

You stole my heart  
While I was waiting  
But now that you're gone  
I guess I'll keep holding on to memories  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams  
With you beside me  
Wanting to hold you  
That's all I need But how? It's over?  
And now I know what a fool I've been  
You told me you loved me  
And that love never ends  
I can't pretend  
It's hard to say goodbye  
Time, time be my friend  
When will this end  
This empty feeling  
Now, I'll follow the sun  
I guess I'll just carry on  
Without you...  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams with you beside me  
Wanting to hold you

That you and I once met

People in panic but smiling  
Rushing around, laughing out loud

We'll just brush away our tears

And here I am alone starting to realize  
That my days would be brighter  
If I could learn to hide  
The feeling that I have for you  
Keeps hurting me inside  
  
Then my days begin  
With simple thoughts of you  
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all ""I need is you""  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end  
With just one wish, that's you  
To hold me in the dark  
And help me make it through  
'Cause the pain that's inside me  
Would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me  
And promise me you'd stay  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care

When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.

For the little dark star on the wind down there,  
And He stated and promised He'd take special care  
So it wouldn't get lost again.  
  
Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim,  
And the clouds blow over and darken him,  
So long as the Lord God's watching over them,  
Keeping track how it all goes on.  
  
But I've been walking through the night and the day,  
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray,  
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away,  
Forgetting the promise that we heard Him say.  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars,  
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night,  
And we're lost out here in the stars,

A black haired beauty from New Orleans  
Did my duty can I buy you a drink dear  
She said ""Please""  
  
(So) we rolled right along,  
And the night got long  
So I said how would you like it to be?  
  
Then she sang her song  
Said ""If I come along  
You must find a place in your heart for me""  
  
I was lost on a road to nowhere  
And asked if she was goin' my way  
She was late for a date with no one  
(So) please don't leave  
  
She'd just left a love that was dying  
And had no plans of goin back  
I caught her eyes as she was crying  
""Let's make tracks""

As the morning came, the feelings faded.  
They melted away with the dew.  
And if it hurt, I never felt it,  
'Cause I knew that you'd be leavin' me soon.  
  
Come on, baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads.  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest.

Well it may not be easy, but then nothin' else was  
Ask a mountain climber why he does what he does

But we'll believe in one another  
Whatever we find  
  
And when you need a hand to guide you  
I will be there walking beside you

Caught by some hand of desire.  
Held by the feelings that brings them together.  
Its all a mystery. When will they learn.  
Its just emotion on fire.  
That soul taking, primitive, passion of nature.

I try to run. I try to never fall apart.  
But love takes pleasure from  
The burning of the heart  
Burning of the heart.  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher.  
And watching for questions I have in my mind.  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer.

Richard Marx,Miami 2017,/r/richard+marx/miami+2017_20116049.html,"I've seen the lights go out on broadway,  
I saw the empire state laid low.  
And life went on beyond the palaces.  
They all bought cadillacs,  
Left there long ago  
  
We held a concert out in brooklyn.  
To watch the island bridges blow.  
It turned our power down,  
And drove us underground,  
But we went right on with the show.  
  
I've seen the lights go out on broadway,  
I saw the ruins at life end.  
You know we almost didn't notice it,  
We see it all the time  
On 42nd street  
  
It burned the churches up in harlem  
Like in that spanish civil war.  
The flames were everywhere,  
And no one really cared,  
It always burned up there before  
  
I've seen the rats lie down on broadway,  
And I watched the miami skyline fall.  
The folks were waving at the battery  
The union went on strike  
They never settled it out.  
  
They sent a carrier out from norfolk,  
And picked the yankees up for free.  
They said the queens could stay  
And threw the crowns away,  
And sent manhattan out to sea.  
  
She knows those lights right on broadway  
That was so many years ago.  
Before we all lived in florida.  
Before the mafia,  
Took over mexico.  
  
There are too many who remember.  
They say a handful still survive.  
To tell the world about,  
The way the lights went out,  
To keep the memory alive.

Richard Marx,Teacher I Need You,/r/richard+marx/teacher+i+need+you_20700493.html,"I was sitting in the classroom,  
Trying to look intelligent  
In case the teacher looked at me.  
She was long and she was lean.  
She's a middle-aged dream,  
And that lady means the whole world to me.  
  
It's a natural achievement,  
Conquering my homework  
With her image pounding in my brain.  
She's an inspiration  
For my graduation,  
And she helps to keep the classroom sane.  
  
Oh teacher I need you,  
Like a little child.  
You got something in you  
To drive a schoolboy wild.  
  
You give me education  
In the lovesick blues.  
Help me get straight come out and say,  
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I,  
Teacher I need you.  
  
I have to write a letter,  
Tell about my feelings,  
Just to let her know the scene.  
Focus my attention  
On some further education  
In connection with the birds and the bees.  
  
So I'm sitting in the classroom.  
I'm looking like a zombie.  
I'm waiting for the bell to ring.  
I've got John Wayne stances.  
I've got Erroll Flynn advances,  
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing.

Hardly my sad tale

Nothing worse than trying too hard  
This ain't this fool's first walk in the park

So they would have you believe  
But that don't get me

The way it's always been  
Love is just a word to her  
Another broken dream  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat

Beautiful people surround me  
Everybody falling in love  
Oh you know me, everybody knows that I'm crazy  
Sticks and stones they never break me

I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories  
The time we tried to build a snowman  
The time we tried to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didn't know then  
That we'd ever be apart  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me it's incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do  
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you, you  
  
Another tear, another regret boy, that you're so far away  
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride  
Remember singing by the fire  
There's to much that's in the daylight  
I keep reliving you and I  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me it's incomplete

To add suspense  
To all the games  
Of discontent.  
  
Fear is real  
But not self-taught  
You let others  
Be the cause.  
  
There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
You say it draws near,  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
Tear down  
Those mighty walls.  
Reinvent  
The way you talk.  
  
Look ahead,  
Now down below,  
Or high above,  
Where angels flow.There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
Waiting to see  
Our kind disagree.  
You draw the line  
And stick to your pride.

I know we haven't spoken for a while  
But I was thinkin' bout you

So many things to say  
And I'll put em in a letter  
And thought it might be easier  
The words might come out better  
How's your mother, how's your little brother?  
Does he still look just like you?  
So many things I wanna know the answers to

To get you out my mind

I've got nothin' to lose  
Hope to hear from you soon  
P.S. I'm still not over you  
Still not over you  
  
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on  
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've gone  
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me  
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me  
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the t.v.  
Boy it ain't easy  
When I hear our song  
I get that same old feeling  
Wish I could press rewind  
Turn back the hands of time  
And I shouldn't be telling you

But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good  
(Ooo, yeah)

It's okay, cause what we got it ain't gonna change boy

You've always been the one  
Nobody knows you better  
When all is said and done  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And you're loosin' your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?  
Who ya gonna run to?  
  
You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school  
Memories when you were tryin' so hard to play cool  
I don't mind I know that you gotta go through your changes  
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it

Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum  
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun  
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some  
Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son  
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done  
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didn't have an answer  
Rhythm was a dancer  
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!  
I wore a troop track suit, British Knights shoes, Kangol hat like LL Cool's  
Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large  
They nicked the BMX from out my garage  
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me, he'd smile
like we were mates  
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's  
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams  
Like a hooligan on the football stands  
And I'd throw the v's to Leeds and West Ham  
Then I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay  
Then I ran again cuz I couldn't pay, a Muslim didn't get his fare that day  
I apologize today  
  
Things are better when they start  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
  
And who are you calling poof? You like Wham, man, I hate that stuff  
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had
to nanny me  
School was a laugh, they didn't have ADD, thick was the term they used for me  
(over and over)  
Repeatedly  
(over and over)  
  
Take my breath away take my breath away  
Bidly bidly bidly bong  
Pass it on the left hand side, right turn, Clyde  
  
That girl in the fourth year, got pregnant and she was raised Catholic,
brilliant!  
I cried, she cried, we cried, her youth died  
Drank cider in the cemetery  
The year above us had discovered E and I said it weren't for me  
?12.50? I could rob me mum's purse and buy one off chalcky  
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday  
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday  
Dumped by Sunday  
  
Things are better when they start  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
The wonder years, I've played my part  
That's how the 80s broke my heart  
  
Like I said, I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie, well she said
she fancied me  
And then she said ""fuck me"" and I thought 'fuck me, I'm all talk and it'll be
over too quickly'  
And it was but I couldn't care less, I'd seen a girl's part,made a mess on her
dress, oh yes!  
You're now rocking with the best, second person in my year that had seen a
breast  
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed  
Where are the Falklands mum? And what have they done?  
Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from?  
  
It's the 80s, what you looking at, ya mong?  
So young, so long, so young, so long  
Too short, so long  
What you looking at ya mong?  
Too short, so long, too short, so long  
So long.

Oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Things that I say  
When I say nothing at all  
It leaves a taste in my stomach  
And its no taste at all  
  
I can sing, I can't dance  
But it don't stop me at all  
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all  
  
Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent  
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent  
I won't be happy till the moneys been spent

The little profits go to waste.

Please be gentle I'm still learning.

They poisoned you with compromise,  
At what point did you realize.  
Everybody loves your life,  
But you.

Water gates and Vietnam.

Tears  
It's in the echo of the jackdaw ringing in your ears  
Watch me out of my gates  
Ill advised, unprepared  
No one gave a shit  
When nobody cared  
Another wasted talent

Two's up on an eighth  
All back to mine

That sweet devotion for you  
  
I can't take the fever from you  
I don't want to neither  
They're dropping science on you  
You just need a breather  
I'll be looking over you  
  
Overlooking me

This chemical devotion  
Got to kiss the ceiling

More than a feeling

Shallow in the deep end  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
And I can depend  
On chemical devotion  
It's like my best friend

I stumble through the words as they're leaving me,  
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty,  
And I cut myself just to get them out.

And if you're not here I find myself

No self-control and no reason why,  
If I don't change, then we both die,  
This is it for you and I.

Whilst on board the family coach

No one had been there before  
They were landing there in June  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Meanwhile on the family coach  
The postillion quietly spoke  
He said, ""You can not leave your family coach  
This is not a joke  
We must work out our differences  
Though none of us may change  
We all take different routes through life  
But your coach will stay the same. ""

They had gone behind  
And the human family held it's breath  
And wondered what they'd find  
Our family coach can stay on earth  
Or be a rocket ship  
But wherever, wherever you may go  
Your kin will share the trip  
  
Hey, hey, family coach

That they were simpler days  
And the family coach is smaller now  
Some have passed away  
But there's never been a golden age  
Nostalgia's for the lame  
The best is yet to come, my dear  
It's that kind of game

Real love and the love ever after

Running through my veins

You can see it in my face

Not sure I understand  
This role I've been given  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand

Then the bubble burst  
Who's telling stories  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
My love life's gone stiff  
Don't know who I've been with  
And I'm gonna take it 'cause they want to give  
Can you blame me  
Don't need to spend my bread  
People do that for me instead  
Must be thinking that I'll wake up dead  
In the morning  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
You've got a powerful lawyer  
Well I've got money for ya  
I know I appall ya  
But I fucked your daughter  
I got friends stay up till the end  
Try to screw me or my girlfriend  
Until I'm not the latest trend  
Fetch me butler  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
I can't handle shit  
Kill me or cure me

It fills in time  
When I'm not much use  
But it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
They all say  
I'm too restless  
But words cut deep  
When you're defenceless  
And they're killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
There was a time when we were fine  
And I could tolerate you  
I do believe that you should leave  
'Cause I've grown to hate you  
Should I be weak and turn my cheek  
'Cause I'm scared to fall  
But I just don't know you  
And you don't know me at all  
  
I've been told that love's a celebration  
But I've lost faith through frustration  
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
You paint my picture black  
The joke's on me  
And I don't wanna laugh  
Remember the good times  
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow  
  
I don't mind feeling blue  
If I could smile just like you do  
And it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
I can't go on alone  
Pretending nothing's wrong  
Maybe I just want to belong  
Somewhere, somehow, somehow

It seemed to wipe away the years  
Her face was older, just a little rough  
But her eyes were still so clear  
He drank his coffee and he hurried out  
Across before she walked away  
Then he approached her like a little child  
Too scared for what he had to say  
  
""Hello Louise,  
Remember me?  
Now should we part  
Or stay awhile?  
As if we were still lovers""  
  
She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before  
And as he started to apologise  
Lose any bitterness she bore  
She gently put her finger on his lips  
To let him know she understood  
And with her suitcase standing on the floor  
Embraced him like a lover would  
  
He told louise  
""You look so good  
It's just you see  
You make me feel  
As if we were still lovers""

There are wounds that you don't wanna heal  
The memories of something really good  
Something truly real, that you never found again  
  
As if we were still lovers  
  
And though they talked just for just a little time  
Before she said she had to go  
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign  
That told him all he had to know  
  
And so Louise  
Waved from the bus  
And as she left  
She gave that smile  
As if they were still lovers

He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen
before  
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke  
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages  
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke  
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door  
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores  
""Hi, my name is Sunshine.  
These are my girls.  
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world""  
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun  
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium  
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine  
""What's up?""  
""You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good
time""  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
Don't point that gun at anyone  
Me and my monkey  
Like Billy the Kid  
Trying to understand  
Why he did what he did  
Why he did what he did  
  
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton  
The monkey was high  
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died  
We left before encores  
He couldn't sit still  
Sheena was a blast baby  
But my monkey was ill  
When I played black jack  
Kept hittin' 23  
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me  
Or was it my monkey  
I couldn't be sure  
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before  
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run  
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun  
""My name is Rodriguez"" he says with death in his eye  
""I've been chasing you for a long time amigos  
And now your monkey is gonna die""  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
We don't want to kill no Mexican  
But we got ten itchy fingers  
One thing to declare  
When the monkey is high  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
  
Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy  
And I ain't about to run  
Put your gun down boy  
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow

Standing on the corner feeling blue  
Sweethearts out for fun  
Pass me one by one  
Guess I'll wind up like I always do  
With only  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue  
Me and my shadow  
Not a soul to tell our troubles to  
And when it's twelve o'clock  
We climb the stair  
We never knock  
For nobody's there  
Just me and my shadow  
All alone and feeling blue  
When the sun sets on the far horizon  
And the parlor lamps begin to glow  
Jim and Jack and John  
Put their slippers on  
They're all set but we'restill on the go  
So lonely  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue

And he'd dance for you  
In worn out shoes  
  
With silver hair a ragged shirt  
And baggy pants  
He would do the old soft shoe  
  
He would jump so high  
Jump so high  
Then he lightly touch down  
  
He told me of the time he worked with  
Minstrel shows travelling  
Throughout the south  
  
He spoke with tears of fifteen years  
How his dog and he  
They would travel about.  
  
But his dog up and died  
He up and died  
And after twenty years he still grieved  
  
He said ""I dance now  
At every chance in the Honky Tonks  
For my drinks and tips  
  
But most the time I spend  
Behind these country bars  
You see on I drinks a bit""

Oh lord when he shook his head  
I could swear I heard someone say please

Robbie Williams,My Way,/r/robbie+williams/my+way_20268742.html,"And now the end is near  
So I face the final curtain  
My friend, I'll say it clear  
I'll state my case of which I'm certain  
  
I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each and every highway  
And more, much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few  
But then again, too few to mention  
I did what I had to do  
And saw it through without exception  
  
I planned each charted course  
Each careful step along the byway  
Oh, and more, much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall  
And did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fails, my share of losing  
And now as tears subside  
I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way  
Oh, no, no not me  
I did it my way  
  
For what is a man, what has he got  
If not himself, then he has not  
To say the things he truly feels  
And not the words he would reveal  
The record shows I took the blows  
And did it my way

You went to a better place but they stole you away from me  
  
And now she lives in heaven  
But I know they let her out  
To take care of me  
There's a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight

Bringing heaven down here

In my bedroom tonight

While stroking in my head  
In my darkest hour

Leaning down beside me  
Whispering my prayers  
There's a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight

I'm the man you thought I'd never be.  
The boy who you reduced to tears,  
The lad called ""thingy"" for six whole years.  
Yeah that's right, my names bob,  
The one who landed the popstars job.  
The one who you told: ""Look don't touch""  
The Kid who wouldn'y amount to much.  
Well I'm here, and you're still there  
With your fake sports car and receding hair  
Dodgy, farout trousers that you think are smart  
Married to the woman that teaches art  
Married to the life  
Married to the school  
""I want to sing and dance sir""  
Now who's the fool?  
Sing and dance, you thought I was balmy  
""Settle down thingy, join the army""  
And who were you to tell me this  
The dream I want I'll have to miss  
Sir is god, he's been given the right  
To structure lives overnight.  
Now I know life's true path,  
Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh.  
Nah, not me, I'm a mega civillian  
I won't leave my life riding pillion  
But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do  
For the negitive dickheads just like you.  
As for now the different weapon  
Stage and screen is about to beckon  
And here I sit in first class  
Bollocks sir, kiss my ass.

I don't wanna rock DJ  
But you're making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos you're keeping me up all night  
  
I don't wanna rock, DJ  
But you're making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos your keeping me up all night  
  
Pimpin' aint easy  
Most of them fleece me  
Every night  
Pimpin' ain't easy  
But if you're sellin' it  
It's alright  
  
Come on  
  
I don't wanna rock, DJ  
But you're making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos you're keeping me up all night

Robbie Williams,Rolling Stone,/r/robbie+williams/rolling+stone_20306135.html,"25 and I've come alive  
21 was the time to come undone  
Doesn't everyone  
  
Very young and very ape  
I'm gonna drink and stay up very late  
And hate the sun  
  
And now my heart kicks up a fuss  
I'm a rolling stone  
They say I'm dangerous  
But I'm never alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
You'll be a rolling stone  
  
Got an A in attitude  
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood  
I guess I'm just like you  
  
Being young is over-rated  
One day I'll be old and understated  
But before I'm through....  
  
I'll run naked through the streets  
Be a rolling stone  
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
  
When we die we'll find out other ways  
For getting drunk and throwing it all away  
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday  
It's all in your head  
So get out of your head  
  
And now your heart kicks up a fuss  
You're a rolling stone  
They say you're dangerous  
But you're never alone  
  
I know you're just like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
Be a rolling stone

Robbie Williams,Supreme,/r/robbie+williams/supreme_20116793.html,"Oh it seemed forever stopped today  
All the lonely hearts in London  
Caught a plane and flew away  
And all the best women are married  
All the handsome men are gay  
You feel deprived  
  
Yeah are you questioning your size?  
Is there a tumour in your humour,  
Are there bags under your eyes?  
Do you leave dents where you sit,  
Are you getting on a bit?  
Will you survive  
You must survive  
  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Oh what are you really looking for?  
Another partner in your life to  
Abuse and to adore?  
Is it lovey dovey stuff,  
Do you need a bit of rough?  
Get on your knees  
  
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear  
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment  
That echoes in your ear  
Saying love will stop the pain  
Saying love will kill the fear  
Do you believe  
You must believe  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
I spy with my little eye  
Something beginning with (ah)  
Got my back up  
And now she's screaming  
So I've got to turn the track up  
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up  
I know this girl she likes to switch teams  
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme  
  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Don't let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Don't let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love

There's something really wrong tonight with you  
Me and you  
  
You say you're too young to love  
And too old to hate  
Remote control keeps you awake  
So turn me on  
  
Maybe you could talk and make my day  
You don't have to walk away to  
Stay with me  
Make me change  
Answer me  
Break the chain  
  
News at Ten, Eastenders, and another cup of tea  
And then I fight  
Baby, not tonight  
  
'Cause I'm not dressed to be a clown  
I'm not in the mood for shouting out  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Do you keep your lover out of sight?  
'Cause you smell like someone else tonight  
All right all right  
  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me
