Michael Buble,Stardust,/m/michael+buble/stardust_20325082.html,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wandered down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that would not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
And beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
Nightingale tells it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it always will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
Oh, but that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
The nightingale tell it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

Michael Buble,That's How It Goes,/m/michael+buble/thats+how+it+goes_20415353.html,"That's how it goes  
When you feel so sad you feel so low  
Life seems so bad I know, I know  
That's how it goes  
  
That's how it goes  
You may think it's funny  
But it always shows,  
Try to hide it honey, oh no, it shows.  
That's how it goes  
  
Some people say,  
Everything's gonna be okay,  
Just give it a while,  
You'll find you're back  
Back in style  
  
But I don't know life will get better  
I am sure they know,  
Sooner or later it shows, I know  
That's how it goes  
  
It's funny to see how easy life can be  
Just sit back and smile  
You'll find that life is worthwhile  
That's how it goes  
When you're on top the whole world knows  
Wouldn't want to stop it, oh no, it shows  
That's how it goes

Michael Buble,These Foolish Things (Remind Me Of You),/m/michael+buble/these+foolish+things+remind+me+of+you_20567816.html,"A cigarette that bears a lipsticks' traces  
An airline ticket to romantic places  
And still my heart has wings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
A tinkling piano in the next apartment  
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant  
A fairgrounds' painted swing  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
I know that this was bound to be  
These things have haunted me  
For you, my dear, enchanted me  
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer  
A telephone that ring, but whose to answer?  
Oh, how the ghost of you clings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
The smile of Garbo  
And the scent of roses  
The waiters' whistlin' as the last bar closes  
The songs that Crosby sings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
Babe, these things remind me of you

Michael Buble,What A Wonderful World,/m/michael+buble/what+a+wonderful+world_20341645.html,"I see skies of blue and clouds of white  
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
I see trees of green, red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people going by  
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' ""How do you do?""  
They're really saying ""I love you""  
  
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow  
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Michael Buble,Whatever It Takes,/m/michael+buble/whatever+it+takes_20853109.html,"We've all been hurt by love  
It's out of our hands  
But for all it's worth  
I'm drawing a line that's in the sand  
  
Another morning just won't do  
I need your love to shine on through  
Or it won't be new  
  
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it  
Whatever it takes my love  
To put the lonely days behind us  
I'm laying it down  
Whatever it takes my love  
  
If there's a chance  
For two hearts to celebrate  
To blow out some candles  
And tempt the hands of fate  
  
You make a wish, I'll make one too  
But close your eyes love when you do  
Or it won't be true  
  
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it  
Whatever it takes my love  
To put the lonely days behind us  
I'm laying it down  
Whatever it takes, my love  
  
'Cause I've been wandering 'round  
With the same old blues  
That have been dragging me down  
If you feel the same way too  
Maybe it takes two  
  
And if we give thanks  
For our love at each new dawn  
We'll find the strength  
And the will to carry on  
  
The sun alone will never do  
Without your love to shine on through  
It just won't be new  
  
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it  
Whatever it takes, my love  
To put the lonely days behind us  
I'm laying it down  
Whatever it takes, my love  
(Whatever it takes)  
  
Oh, whatever it takes my love  
To put the lonely days behind us  
Whatever it takes my love, my love, my love  
Whatever it takes  
Whatever it takes my love  
To put the lonely days behind us  
I layin' down, whatever it takes my love

Michael Buble,Winter Wonderland,/m/michael+buble/winter+wonderland_20988328.html,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, Are you married?  
We'll say, No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

The sun in me  
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...  
All these words that young lovers say...  
  
And maybe the walls will crumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I need you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
That's for all time  
(I don't know)  
Baby you gotta know  
(I don't know)

See that you never go  
That's for all time  
Baby, you never know

If it's the stars

I've never been so satisfied  
By love before  
For all the times I've tried  
  
These beginnings could mean more  
Than the brief affair I bargained for  
Little did I know when we began  
That my time had come to win a hand

Beating her voice in her doom

A mystery so sullen in air  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care,

So blind stare the eyes in her head

Of greed and lust  
  
They don't care  
They'd do me for the money

It's all absurd

Now you're wearing a badge  
You're called the ""Just Few""  
And you're fighting the wars  
A soldier must do  
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but  
  
If you show me the cash

If you tell me to cry

You don't care  
You kill for the money

Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?  
Then watch the ones  
With the biggest smiles  
The idle jabbers  
'Cause they're the backstabbers

You find me waiting for a miracle  
You hear me praying for a plan  
You are the only one prepared to rescue me

Then You take away the distance  
Found between the truth and me  
And You give a simple reason  
To my restless rhyme  
Whoa, hide me in the heaven  
You have held within your hand  
And make a way to find a way  
To soothe my mind  
  
[Verse 2]  
There is a way that might seem right to me  
A dim reflection of what's good  
Just an illusion of the best that I can be  
But there's another path You offer me  
I wish I always understood  
Some way You see right through my thoughts and know my needs

Somebody's just assuming  
He's up to nothing good  
Cause he's not like the others  
There goes the neighborhood  
What kind of world are we living in  
When we judge a man by the tone of his skin  
It's crazy  
Cause he has a heart  
Like you have a heart and

Just a fundamental law that we should all live by  
I took it in to tomorrow  
Yea, I walked the earth but I never found  
Any corner of the world  
Where this did not apply  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And looking out I saw no method to the madness there  
Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos, I was scared  
It was a revelation  
Love is getting rare  
  
The people of the land united  
And in my dream we all agreed  
That we should start again  
And this would be our creed

And left behind?  
  
[Chorus]  
Too many times  
I'm back inside  
Wanting desperately to hide  
Yet I know, I know you say  
You have to die  
Too many times  
You hear my cries  
I'm at the end of all my tries  
So, I'm open Lord, so  
Teach me how to die  
  
Here I am again alone  
Afraid I'll lose all that I own  
Yet you see me as your own  
I cannot fall  
  
And what I am I still am not  
At times I count the cost  
Yet I find there's nothing lost  
If I give it all  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

How I wish we would have known  
But long awaited Holy Stranger  
Make yourself at home  
Please make yourself at home  
  
Bring your peace into our violence  
Bid our hungry souls be filled  
World now breaking Heaven's silence  
Welcome to our world

Fragile finger sent to heal us  
Tender brow prepared for them  
Tiny heart whose blood will save us  
Unto us is born  
Unto us is born  
  
So wrap our injured flesh around You  
Breathe our air and walk our sod  
Rob our sin and make us holy  
Perfect Son of God

To be living life on the other side  
Please don't make me feel like I don't know

Hey won't you listen to me now  
It makes no difference if I wish upon a star  
The only absolute is that the Word of Life  
Is written on my heart  
Oh I believe  
Yes, I believe  
  
Hey look at me, living life for you  
When it's good, when it's hard  
You know me, you know my heart  
Yea, yea, yea I give up anything at all  
When you call  
All I know it's worth it all  
  
I know you're scared to let me know you  
I know you got a heavy kind of soul  
And I know it's harder to believe in love when you're  
Feeling all alone  
They're taking bets on who the lover of your soul  
And your heart is gonna be  
They're taking on all the things that get you down and out  
The moment you believe  
I believe in you  
Yes, I believe in you

You never been on the road to riches  
This the story I tell so you pay attention  
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it  
So I take that pot and fucking beat it  
You never been on the road to riches  
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it  
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it  
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it  
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it  
When we dropped Versace, then y'all did it  
They hate that we came from the Northside  
Then lived in the city, got mob ties  
They hate that we came in with plenty juice

Remember the days with the pocket rockets  
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket  
It's a million dollars in the corner pocket  
I just share the rock like I'm John Stockton  
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets  
My niggas [?], then go up out it  
Ain't no need to talk about it  
Megaton trucks, it don't weigh enough  
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up  
You mad cause your label do finger fucks

Finessing the plug for his riches  
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula  
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken  
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley  
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition

Double cup, a nigga still be sipping  
Got a plug out in Mississippi  
Wrap it up, ship it to Finley  
I trap out the bando, don't trap out the trap house  
And whatever you with, we with it

Fuck the negativity, fuck the critics

Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent

Your mom and dad might hate me but in 5 years I'm the president  
  
I wanna a girl, I get her  
And I get her friend  
Five girls singhing in my bedroom, start my own band  
They love me in my peak,  
But this love is fake.  
Everyday's my birthday, cause bitches love cake  
  
Decisions, but I want it all so I get it all  
I wanna eat the whole cache  
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing  
You should have to learn how to bake  
  
Yes I want it all so I get it all  
I wanna eat the hole cake  
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing  
You should learned bitches love cake!

And through my tears, I sang along  
I picked up the phone and then put it down

Miley Cyrus,Left Heart Broken,/m/miley+cyrus/left+heart+broken_20751797.html,"Verse 1:  
  
There was this guy,  
A little smaller,  
He was great,  
And I was taller.  
He was the one I needed.  
I asked him out,  
But he said no,  
Just wanna be friends,  
But I'm sorry though.  
So I begged and pleeded.  
  
Chorus:  
  
So I was left heart broken.  
And no more words were spoken.  
The next day he didn't even speak.  
I looked away I felt so week.  
I didn't even get one kiss.  
How the hell can he do this.  
But he thinks it's alright again.  
So now still we are just friends.  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Still love him though,  
Atleast I tried,  
But I think I'd,  
Rather have died,  
But I'm dead over it.  
It took some time,  
To let him go,  
It wasn't easy,  
But I think we know,  
I like him a bit.  
  
Chorus x2  
No more words to be spoken,  
You left me heart broken.

How the Pheonix of our love first flapped its silver wings  
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened  
And how it all mellowed as it grew

And how you would turn to hide your smile  
Then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed  
And both of us meandered on for miles  
  
I remember the time I said I really had to go  
I remember the tears that filled your eyes  
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie  
And though you never knew I did, I cried  
  
It's amazing how time can so softly change your ways  
And make you look at things that can't be seen  
How the years that roll by can start you listening  
Not just to what they say, but what they mean

Summer's here.  
  
The Autumn trees swing to and fro.  
Their leaves turn brown,

Better.  
Better.

Ev'ryone one feels good  
And I knew they would.

The Monkees,Daddy's Song,/m/monkees/daddys+song_20095334.html,"Years ago I knew a man  
He was my mother's biggest fan  
We used to walk beside the sea  
And he'd tell how my life would be  
When I grew up to be a man  
Years ago we used to play  
He used to laugh when I ran away  
But when I fell and hurt my knee  
He used to come and comfort me  
And the pain would go away  
  
Years ago I knew a boy  
He was his daddy's pride and joy  
But when the daddy went away  
It was such a rainy day  
That he brought out all his toys  
Now the momma did explain  
Trying to take away the pain  
He just couldn't understand  
That his father was not a man  
And it all was just a game  
  
Years have passed and so have I  
Making it hard to cry  
And if and when I have a son  
Let it all be said and done  
Let all that sadness pass him by

When they find me in the morning wet and drowned

Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
Comin' up for air  
It's pretty stuffy under there  
I'd like to say I didn't care

I'd gladly leave that girl alone  
What a way to spend the night

But I can't swim a single note  
He threw me in to teach me how  
I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow

If I could find my way to shore  
I'd never, never do this anymore  
I'll give you three, I've been down nine  
I'm goin' down just one more time.  
Goin' down. Goin' down.  
  
Now the sky is gettin' light  
An everything will be all right  
Think I finally got the knack  
Just floatin' here lazy on my back  
I never really liked that town  
I think I'll ride the river down  
Just movin' slow and floatin' free  
There's a river swinging under me.  
Waving back to the folks on shore

I'll go down groovin' all the way.

And washes my castles away.  
Then I'm really not so sure  
When side of the bed I should lay,  
I should lay...  
  
You keep looking for someone  
To tell your troubles to,  
I'll sit down and lend an ear  
Yet I hear nothing new.

Observing what's below  
Acorns falling to the ground,

Blue guitar,  
Fortune of my ways  
Making of my days.

Counting up the ways  
Happiness is lazy.

If you can't put the words to the tune,  
Tell the rhyme from the reason,  
What should it matter  
To the fool or the dreamer?  
  
New hope,  
Travellers in a storm,  
Finding love is warm.  
New day,  
The world has just begun,  
Our eyes have seen the sun.

The wheel keeps on turning

Turning around  
  
Words left unsaid may have special meanings  
Dust hidden pages fill the books left unread  
One blank page left the poet crying  
He failed to remember there's a price on his head  
  
And the wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
Turning around  
  
Away we sail with all our flags flying  
Too many changes can cause us to delay  
Each star in the sky is there for a reason  
Making it so bright for this time of day

Do you need somewhere  
A place to hide?  
A smile from your face  
Where the light comes shining through  
All its strength - it came from you  
It's lost now, all that age before I knew you  
Is it that forever is hard to find?  
You made me recognize what I'd been leaving far behind  
Is it closing in on you like it was on me?  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring  
  
When you're following all life's lies  
And find its meaning  
And truth still hides  
Don't cover your face  
Let the warmth come flowing through  
Welcome dawn, new morning dew  
  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring

You represent embarrassment and failure  
And the father who must be killed  
Is the blight upon your blighted life  
And his might is his legal right  
To ground you down  
  
Stepchild, with every petty swipe  
You just might find you're fighting for your life  
And the father who must be killed  
Is a step farther but nonetheless  
The way he chews his food  
Rips right through your senses  
  
Stepchild, there's a knife in a drawer in a room downstairs  
And you, you know what you must do  
So the stepchild ran with a knife to his sleeping frame  
And slams it in his arms, his legs, his face, his neck and says  
""There's a law against me now""  
And the father who must be killed  
With his dying breath, he grabs her hand  
And he looks into her eyes  
He says ""I'm sorry"" and he dies  
  
""Stepchild, I release you  
With this broken voice I beseech you""  
  
""Why are lives so short?""  
The stepchild thought half pointing to the sky  
""No one to warn me  
No hand to touch me  
And no Bible-belters to mess with me  
Mama don't miss me  
Mama don't miss me  
This death will complete me""  
""But where I go there will be no one to meet me  
I know there will be no one to meet me""

""Just as mother-less birds fly high  
Then so shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I""

I took her walking on the sandy beaches  
Under a silk Carribean moon  
That's when she proimsed that  
And I promised this  
And til this day I can still picture it...  
She took my hand  
And I took her kiss  
So temporary the moments of bliss  
  
Some Dreams just fade away  
Like yesterday's sunset  
Some Dreams are made to stay  
She's one dream I'll never forget  
  
Everyday just seemed to go to quickly  
And every night just passed us in a blur  
I never noticed the blue skies and waters  
Becuase I only had eyes for here  
And so when she promised that  
And I promised this  
And to this day I can still picture it

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!

Nat King Cole,If Love Ain't There,/n/nat+king+cole/if+love+aint+there_20098048.html,"(johnny burke)  
  
  
Better face the facts, ol' buddy,  
And be prepared to take the blow.  
You don't have to sit and study,  
It's something anyone should know.  
Shake hands... get your hat...  
And go.  
  
You can praise her eyes,  
And adore her hair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can walk her home  
In the warm spring air,  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can look  
With a longing in your look,  
And try every method in the book  
And worship the smile that kind of  
Took you unaware.  
  
And you can weep and sigh,  
You can say, ""unfair"".  
You can almost die of despair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.

Freeze, blame it on the breeze  
Start to sneeze, get the measles  
  
She'll get you off balance  
Then suddenly shove duck  
When she throws her hook out

Pick up your pack and cook out

Look out where you're rowing  
Stay close to the bank  
That river is flowing  
Right into a tank  
  
Look out where you ramble  
You're out on the loose  
You're liable to amble  
Ride into a noose  
  
You better look out or better turn about

How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh, morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh, holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel

Natalie Cole,Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,/n/natalie+cole/lucy+in+the+sky+with+diamonds_20802504.html,"Picture yourself in boat on a river,  
With tangerine trees and marmalde skies  
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,  
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,  
Towering over your head.  
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,  
And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain  
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,  
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,  
That grow so incredibly high.  
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,  
Waiting to take you away.  
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,  
And you're gone.  
  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  
Picture yourself on a train in a station,  
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,  
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,  
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Natalie Cole,Lush Life,/n/natalie+cole/lush+life_20565109.html,"I used to visit all the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails.  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces  
With distant gay traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales.  
  
Then you came along with your siren of song  
To tempt me to madness!  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness  
Of a great love for me.  
  
Ah yes! I was wrong  
Again,  
I was wrong.  
  
Life is lonely again,  
And only last year everything seemed so sure.  
Now life is awful again,  
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore.  
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,  
All I care is to smile in spite of it.  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.  
Romance is mush,  
Stifling those who strive.  
I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be, while I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

The bloom, the bloom blushed deeper red  
With every drop of sacrifice you bled

There's no flowers without the rain  
We are bound together by blood that's flowing through us  
And that's the way it is with love

I see a hill, across a healing stream  
Where the Rose arose, to set us free  
And the Cross became a family tree

And turns us into special things, somehow  
And one day we'll hold little flowers of our own  
And we'll sacrifice so that they can grow

I've fallen on the way  
He's heard the desperation of my cry  
Oh, one drink of living water, can heal the hurt inside  
He fills my cup, it never will run dry  
For the price of my redemption is covered by the blood  
And I have been made worthy  
By His gift of love

Tellin' me I gotta make a change  
All I ever hear day and night is""You better hurry up and get a life""  
I need some direction-'cause the clock is tickin' away  
Then a friend of a friend of mine  
Says I've really been on his mind  
And wants to go out and check out what the feelin's about  
Says we have a deep connection-well it sure is news to me  
And all I can say is  
Intuition tells me how to live my day  
Intuition tells me when to walk away  
Could have turned left  
Could have turned right  
But I ended up here  
Bang in the middle of real life  
Then another one always says-she'd do anything to get ahead  
She doesn't care if she has to scratch and claw to get in the door  
She wants her 15 minutes of fame and 20 would be nice  
But I guess it's her life  
'Cause intuition tells me that I'm doin' fine  
Intuition tells me when to draw the line  
Could have turned left  
Could have turned right  
But I ended up here  
Bang in the middle of real life  
should have turned left  
But I turned right  
And I ended up here  
And I fell alright  
You make it hard for me  
Can't find the real you  
You really think that I can't see  
What it is that you're trying to do

Behind the door  
In the dark  
You play his games  
Forget yourself  
Forget your name  
  
I stand at an open window

Walk away and don't look back

Be there, making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay  
  
Everyday, Everyday, Everyday  
Oh everyday I'll stop believing that I should burn like crazy  
Cos if I did you chase me  
Anyway you give me reason not to walk away  
I stop believing that the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting today I'm not gonna waste another moment...

Right back from the other side  
She moves with confidence  
Not afraid of every consequence

Right back from the other side

Like a joke that no one gets

While she is waiting  
  
She knows the dangers there, these love affairs  
Run hot, run cold and always take their toll  
Its another lonely night inside those empty rooms  
She knows will never be a home  
There must be etc.

One from the heart, she can believe

And still shes on her own  
I hope somewhere, somehow, ssomeday  
Shell find that special one before her heart turns cold.

I'm always on the other side of you  
I'm always on the other side of you  
  
I want to play but you like to fight  
I rise in the morning, you hide in the night  
No matter what I do  
I'm always on the other side of you  
  
Like paralell lines, so near yet so far  
Like north pole and south pole, were oceans apart  
I'm always on the other side of you  
  
You let go, I try to connect  
You always remember, I try to forget  
I'm always on the other side of you.

Nazareth,Rags To Riches,/n/nazareth/rags+to+riches_20098612.html,"It's a sign of the times, standing in line  
Quietly waiting to go out of your mind  
There's nothing to say, no reason to stay  
To fight for the right that they have taken away  
Get what you get, not what you need  
Time after time  
  
(1) Rags to riches, all fallen down  
Rags to riches, tied up and bound  
There's no going under  
When you're kicked to the ground  
Rags to riches..rags to riches  
  
You're down on your knees, caught in the freeze  
Crying inside but there's no easy release  
Radical views--in yesterday news  
Giving the reason with another excuse  
Out on your own, cut to the bone  
Time after time

Come tomorrow, may be a soldier  
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Drunk and mad

My dress is ruined

Ill shoe game and  
No regular cat could get that  
She only wanted two things  
A puppy and a man that  
Wanted more than to just hit that  
  
Well out on the block  
What did she spot a  
Pretty thug walkin a baby rot wiler  
  
Pow  
They caught eyes  
It was love at first sight  
Crazy how somethin that seems so right can go wroongg  
See it didn't take too long  
For her to see just what this dude was on  
  
He was a good dude true and deep  
But he liked to make his money runnin the street  
So she hit him with its either the block or me

He must make that paper just  
Gotta get his hustle on  
  
But it hurts him to his heart cus his love is strong  
And though hes tryna make things right for her  
All she see's is wrong  
All he can do is keep on  
Cus she don't understand just what hes on  
  
You see he loved her true and deep

Ne-Yo,Non-Fiction,/n/ne+yo/non+fiction_21094290.html,"[Intro]  
The story you 'bout to hear is complete fiction. It is however made up of a
group of stories, true stories about real people. Thus creating real
characters going through real things. Thus making the story itself real, true
and a real story, a true story, is non-fiction  
  
Our story begins in a dark place. A place where you learn that everything that
you wanted, could potentially be the very thing that leads to your
destruction. The very thing you should fear. This is a lesson learned the hard
way, experience being the only teacher. I mean you can't exactly tell a broke
man that money is evil and expect him to listen to you now can you? Naw he's
got to go down that road, he's got to face them demons himself before he can
acquire that knowledge. The money solves one group of problems only to
introduce another. Strangers become friends, friends become enemies. The fame,
just like any other drug feels incredible until you realize all that
adoration, all that love, ain't real. And the women, huh, the women, a drug
you use that uses you right back. A high for a high so to speak. Which brings
us to Tammy

Neil Diamond,As Time Goes By,/n/neil+diamond/as+time+goes+by_20665987.html,"You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you,""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
It's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by

Beats in time with yours

Who dreamed of bein' a king  
And then became one  
Well except for the names  
And a few other changes  
If you talk about me  
The story's the same one  
But I got an emptiness deep inside  
And I've tried  
But it won't let me go  
And I'm not a man who likes to swear  
But I never cared  
For the sound of being alone  
  
""I am""...I said  
To no one there  
And no one heard at all  
Not even the chair  
""I am""...I cried

Neil Diamond,I Dreamed A Dream,/n/neil+diamond/i+dreamed+a+dream_20712570.html,"There was a time when girls were kind  
When their voices were soft  
And their words inviting  
There was a time when love was blind  
  
And the world was a song  
And the song was exciting  
There was a time  
It all went wrong  
  
I dreamed a dream of time gone by  
When hope was high  
And life worth living  
I dreamed that love would never die  
I dreamed that God would be forgiving  
  
When I was young and unafraid  
When dreams were made  
And used and wasted  
There was no ransom to be paid  
  
No song unsung, no wine un-tasted  
But the tigers come at night  
With their voices soft as thunder  
And they tear your hope apart  
  
As they turn your dream to shame....  
She slept this summer by my side  
She filled my days with endless wonder  
She took my childhood in her stride  
  
But she was gone when autumn came  
And still I dream she'll come to me  
That we will spend the years together  
But there are dreams that cannot be  
  
And there are storms we cannot weather  
I had a dream my life would be  
So different from this hell I'm living  
So different now from what it seemed  
But life can't kill  
The dream I dreamed

As free as a bird  
Every voice would be

A beautiful place  
Where we would weave  
Such a wonderful dream

Guess there's no reason to stay  
Maybe it's time to close the door  
  
Darlin',

Why can't it be like before

Tell me why, why did she have to go

Is on your case

And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love

Your mind up yet

Do you wrong  
I've known it from  
The moment that we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
I'd go hungry,  
I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling down  
The avenue  
There's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rollin' sea  
And on the highway of regret  
The winds of change  
Are blowing wild and free  
You ain't seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy,  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldn't do  
Go to the ends of the earth  
For you  
To make you feel my love

And man will live for evermore,  
Because of Christmas Day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bear the child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
By and by they found a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little boy was born  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
New king's born today  
And man will live for evermore  
Because of Christmas Day  
  
While shepherds  
Watched their flocks by night  
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard the choir from heaven sing  
The music seemed to come from afar  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing,  
Listen to what they say  
That man will live for evermore

Neil Sedaka,Going Nowhere,/n/neil+sedaka/going+nowhere_20207077.html,"Considering  
So many folks, dissatisfied with everything,  
Who need someone to understand they're lonely, they're lonely,  
And they're not alone.  
  
And everywhere  
They shrug their shoulders, tell themselves that they don't care,  
And all the while they make believe they're happy, oh they're happy,  
But not really.  
  
And they're asked to hold the world together,  
Make it happen, give it children,  
Who in turn are turning on to going nowhere.  
And all the strength they'd ever need to help them  
Has been wasted, remains hidden,  
In the confusion of going nowhere.  
  
And who am I  
To criticize the world that I have grown up in.  
Most of you would tell me that I'm crazy, yes I'm crazy,  
I can't help it.  
  
I understand  
That where you are is where you've been so many years,  
And things that tend to change you, tend to hurt you, yes they hurt you,  
Very deeply.  
  
And still you try to hold the world together,  
Make it happen, give it children  
Who in turn are turning on to going nowhere.  
And all the strength they'd ever need to help them  
Has been wasted, remains hidden,  
In the confusion of going nowhere,  
Going nowhere,  
Going, going, going nowhere,  
Going nowhere.

Neil Young,Barstool Blues,/n/neil+young/barstool+blues_20099334.html,"If I could hold on  
To just one thought  
For long enough to know  
Why my mind is moving so fast  
And the conversation is slow.  
Burn off all the fog  
And let the sun  
Through to the snow  
Let me see your face again  
Before I have to go.  
  
I have seen you in the movies  
And in those magazines at night  
I saw you on the barstool when  
You held that glass so tight.  
And I saw you in my nightmares  
But I'll see you in my dreams  
And I might live a thousand years  
Before I know what that means.  
  
Once there was a friend of mine  
Who died a thousand deaths  
His life was filled with parasites  
And countless idle threats.  
He trusted in a woman  
And on her he made his bets  
Once there was a friend of mine  
Who died a thousand deaths.

With folded arms the chief stood watching  
Painted braves slipped down the hill  
In his ears the spirit talking  
As they closed in  
For an easy kill  
  
At the house the door was wide open  
Wind blew curtains off the rod

She was praying to her god  
  
He was luckier than most men

As she stood their in the doorway  
Her long dress flowing  
Would he make it this time

That's the place where the cancer cowboy rides  
Pure as the driven snow before it got him

Sometimes I feel like my own name

Neil Young,Changes,/n/neil+young/changes_21083960.html,"(Verse)  
Sit by my side, come as close as the air,  
Share in a memory of gray  
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures  
That I play of changes  
  
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall  
To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die, trapped within  
the circle time parade of changes  
  
Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind,  
Visions of shadows that shine.  
Til one day I returned and found they were the  
Victims of the vines of changes  
  
The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark  
Swings through a hollow of haze  
A race around the stars, a journey through  
The universe ablaze with changes  
  
Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
But when the morning breaks they're swept away by  
golden drops of dawn, of changes  
  
Passions will part to a strange melody.  
As fires will sometimes burn cold  
Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver  
strings of souls, of changes  
  
Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else,  
One last cup of wine we will pour  
And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on  
the rolling river shores of changes  
  
Sit by my side, come as close as the air,  
Share in a memory of gray  
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures  
That I play of changes

There's another poor man  
Falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
  
On this noisy shore  
Standing at the edge of you.  
Could those dreams of yours be true  
Or did you, did you, did you  
Pushed it over the end?  
How much time did you spend?  
Pushed it over the end.  
  
Good lookin' Milly's  
Into politics now  
And things are looking much better  
She keeps ten men in her garage  
Knitting her fine sweaters.  
At the end of a weary day  
She feels hard and she looks hard.

Excavating for a mine  
Dwelt a miner forty niner,  
And his daughter Clementine  
  
Light she was and like a fairy,  
And her shoes were number nine,  
Herring boxes, without topses,  
Sandals were for Clementine.  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
  
Drove she ducklings to the water  
Every morn just at nine,  
Hit her foot against a splinter,  
Fell into the foaming brine.  
  
Ruby lips above the water,  
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,  
But, alas, I was no swimmer,  
So I lost my Clementine.  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
  
And the minor forty niner  
Soon began to peak and pine  
Thought he oughta join his daughter  
Now he's left with Clementine  
  
In my dreams she still upon me  
Broken garments soaked in brine  
Though in life I used to hug her,  
In death I draw the line  
  
Clementine! Clementine!  
Oh my darling, Clementine!  
(Oh my darling, oh my darling)  
  
How I missed her! How I missed her,  
How I missed my Clementine,  
So I kissed her little sister,  
And I forgot my Clementine.

And dream of being stars.  
We started a band,  
We played all night.

We played all night  
I really hate to leave you now  
But to stay just wouldn't be right.  
Down in Hollywood  
We played so good  
  
The businessmen crowded around  
They came to hear the golden sound  
There we were on the Sunset Strip,  
Playing our songs for the highest bid.  
We played all night  
The price was right.  
  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.

A millionaire through a business man's eyes.

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the cloud she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me

Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
Cause she once was a true love of mine  
  
[Verse:]  
If you're goin' when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends  
Please see for me she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howling wind  
  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breasts  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
That's the way I remember her best  
  
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day

As some things I have seen.  
The picture painted here

The sadder you fall  
The laughter in your eyes

Give me strength to move along.  
Give me strength  
To leave my sweetheart.  
  
I'm riding down this wet road  
In my old car  
The moon is almost full  
Except for stars.  
The party ended  
Long before the night  
She made me feel alive  
And that's all right.

Neil Young,Goin' Home,/n/neil+young/goin+home_20206740.html,"On the hill where Custer was,  
Making his last stand,  
With the Indians all around,  
And his gun in his hand.  
  
Such a wind was blowing that day,  
Through the battleground,  
I could feel it in my hair,  
As I turned towards downtown.  
  
Weaving through the buildings,  
Cutting though the streets,  
Slicing through the culture,  
Piling on the weeks.  
  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home.  
  
Dropping in on you my friend,  
Is just like old times,  
Said the fool who signed the paper,  
To assorted slimes.  
  
It's hard to get blood from a stone  
But for you I'll give it a try,  
To provide your accomodations,  
And leave you satisfied.  
  
You'd think it was easy,  
To give your life away,  
To not have to live up to,  
The promises you made.  
  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home.  
  
Elusively she cut the phone,  
Moved from cell to cell,  
Really looking remarkable,  
And obviously doing well.  
  
She made a turn on a wooden bridge,  
Into the battleground,  
With a thousand warriors on the ridge,  
She tried to turn her radio down.  
  
Battle drums were pounding,  
All around her car,  
She saw her clothes were changing,  
Into sky and stars.  
  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home, I'm going home.  
Going home, I'm going home.

Neil Young,Grandpa's Interview,/n/neil+young/grandpas+interview_20536417.html,"""Grandpa, here's your coffee,""  
Said Edith, as she filled his cup.  
""Nobody'll find you here,  
And Earl is glad you guys showed up.""  
""The way things are downtown,  
You might have to stay for awhile.  
  
There was a helicopter hovering over your house  
When I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.""  
""Who the hell do they think they are,  
Invading our home like that?  
Grandma and I had to leave so fast,  
We couldn't even catch the cat.""  
  
""The helicopter scared the shit out of him,  
And it took off down a trail,  
Down past the railroad track,  
Towards the county jail.""  
  
""Jed, you really screwed up now!  
What did you have to do that for?  
Everybody wants to hang your ass,  
And here's a note from Lenore.""  
Sun touched the cold steel bars  
As she pushed the paper in.  
Jed took it up and read it  
And he couldn't hide a grin.  
  
Outside the jail window  
A crow flew across the sky,  
Completely disappearing behind each bar,  
Then a helicopter flew by.  
""Say hi to Earl and Edith.  
Tell 'm I'm doing fine.  
Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,  
They should cut the line.""  
  
""Can grandma come and see me?  
I got a new song to sing  
It's longer than all the others combined  
And it doesn't mean a thing.""  
The noise was unfamiliar,  
Generators whirling,  
Walkie-talkies screaming,  
Vans parked in the open field.  
  
TV crews and cameras,  
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch.  
They came through the gate and across the lawn  
Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.  
And grandpa saw them there,  
Looking through the venetian blind.  
""Those people don't have any respect,  
So they won't get any of mine.""  
  
""I don't wanna talk about Jed.  
I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.  
I don't have time to talk that fast,  
And it ain't my crime.""  
  
""It ain't a privilege to be on TV  
And it ain't a duty either.  
The only good thing about TV  
Is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'""  
  
""'Shows with love and affection',  
Like mama used to say.  
A little Mayberry living  
Could go a long way.""  
  
He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,  
Loaded up both barrels.  
Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,  
And up walked a woman named Carol.  
  
""Susan Carol from Early Magazine,  
I got some questions to ask.""  
""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!""  
Grandpa said with a gasp.  
  
Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,  
And Edith ran out in shock.  
He was looking at her from down on the floor,  
Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk.  
  
""That guy just keeps singin'!  
Can somebody shut him up?  
I don't know for the life of me  
Where he comes up with that stuff.""  
  
They laid his head on a newspaper  
With a picture of Carmichael on the front page,  
Posing with the little league baseball team,  
And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.  
  
Grandpa died a hero.  
Trying to stop the media.  
Fighting for freedom of silence.  
Trying to be anonymous.  
  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Live so long.

The water and the flower is a bad dream  
The stocking drawn reveals the end of sight

Banging on an open gate

What's that thing I saw him give you  
Turn round don't come no closer

All the things they are told

You may have wanted some of them but who can ever tell?

The headaches and the nausea will pass and you'll endure.  
You son is gone forever though, of that the doctor's sure.

The aftershocks remain.

They've managed to get rid of me, I'm gone without a trace,  
But sear the soul and leave scar no treatment can erase.  
They've cut away the cancer but forgot to fill the hole.  
They removed me from your memory, I'm still there in your soul.  
Your life goes back to normal now, or so they all believe.  
Your heart is in your chest again, not hanging from your sleeve.  
They've driven out the demons and they've earned you this reprieve.

The aftershocks live on.

Is there nothing left to grieve?

Every little thing

Hail the pentecostal morn

Where christ returns to his loved ones  
I look at the stone apostles  
Think that it's alright for some  
  
And I wish that I was made of stone  
So that I would not have to see  
A beauty impossible to define  
A beauty impossible to believe  
  
A beauty impossible to endure  
The blood imparted in little sips  
The smell of you still on my hands  
As I bring the cup up to my lips  
  
No God up in the sky  
No devil beneath the sea  
Could do the job that you did, baby  
Of bringing me to my knees  
  
Outside I sit on the stone steps  
With nothing much to do  
Forlorn and exhausted, baby  
By the absence of you

To see her accusing finger spurt  
To see flies swarm her hateful eye  
To watch her groaning in the dirt  
To see her clicking tongue crack dry  
O brother, buy me one more drink  
One more drink and then goodbye  
And do not mock me when I say  
Let's drink one more before I die

Well I've been swinging from the stars  
Now this wretch in beggars clothing  
Bangs his cup across the bars  
Look, this cup of mine is empty!  
Seems I've misplaced my desires  
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes  
Of all my former fires  
So brother, be a brother  
And fill this tiny cup of mine  
And please, sir, make it whiskey  
For I have no head for wine  
  
O brother, my cup is empty  
And I haven't got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey

And counted only one  
One tiny little blessing  
And now that blessings gone  
So buy me one more drink, my brother  
Then I'm taking to the road  
Yes, I'm taking to the rain  
I'm taking to the snow  
O my friend, my only brother  
Do not let the party grieve  
So throw a dollar onto the bar

You climbed a spiral stair  
You searched for me all among  
The knowledgeable air  
I was hidden, babe, hiding all away  
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away  
  
You entered the cathedral  
When you heard the solemn knell  
I was not sitting with the gargoyles  
I was not swinging from the hell  
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away

From Sappho through to Auden

Some were eating cold potatoes

He basted you with butter, babe  
And made you crawl inside

Who lifted up his cleaver  
Stuck his fist up your dress

Up above, girls walk past, the roses all in bloom  
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson blues  
I'm goin' down to Geneva baby, gonna teach it to you  
  
Who cares, who cares what the future brings?  
Black road long and I drove and drove  
I came upon a crossroad  
The night was hot and black  
I see Robert Johnson,  
With a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back,  
Lookin' for a tune  
  
Well here comes Lucifer,  
With his canon law,  
And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw  
He got the real killer groove  
Robert Johnson and the devil man  
Don't know who's gonna rip off who  
  
Driving my car, flame trees on fire  
Sitting and singin' the Higgs Boson blues,  
I'm tired, I'm lookin' for a spot to drop  
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now  
In the Lorraine Motel, it's hot, it's hot  
That's why they call it the Hot Spot  
I take a room with a view  
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yea  
Making the hot cocks in the flophouse bleed  
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops  
And a bellhop hops and bops  
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove  
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues  
  
If I die tonight, bury me  
In my favorite yellow patent leather shoes  
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat  
That the caliphate forced on the Jews  
Can you feel my heartbeat?  
Can you feel my heartbeat?  
  
Hannah Montana does the African Savannah  
As the simulated rainy season begins  
She curses the queue at the Zulus  
And moves on to Amazonia  
And cries with the dolphins  
Mama ate the pygmy  
The pygmy ate the monkey  
The monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you  
Look here comes the missionary  
With his smallpox and flu  
He's saving them savages  
With his Higgs Boson Blues

How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?  
How long, how long, baby how long.  
  
Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train  
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain.  
How long, How long, how long.  
  
If I could holler like a mountain jack  
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back.  
  
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see  
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me.  
  
I can see the green grass growin' on the hill  
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill.  
  
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee

Dancers writhed and squirmed and then,  
Came apart and then writhed again  
Like squirming flies on a pin  
In the heat and in the din  
Yes, in the heat and in the din  
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad john finn

I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife  
Over near the bandstand with john finn's wife  
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair  
Sprinkled with wedding confettis  
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares  
Armed, as they were, with machetes  
And the night through the window was full of lights  
Winking and awatching at john finns' wife

The moon full of blood and light  
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight

Enter john finn in his shrunken suit  
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot  
With his filled-down teeth and a hobnail boot  
And his fists full of pistols in his pockets

And with fear in my guts like tangled twine

And the three of us walk out of the hall  
  
Now the night bore down upon us all  
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call  
And guns did flare and guns did bawl  
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck  
Of mad john finn. I took his wretched life  
Now I'm over near the bandstand  
Every hand moving on john finns' wife  
Every hand moving on john finns' wife  
  
And john finns' wife  
Took all the flowers down  
From her hair  
And threw them on the ground  
And the flies did hum  
And the flies did buzz around

Nick Cave,Knoxville Girl,/n/nick+cave/knoxville+girl_20612140.html,"I met a little girl in Knoxville  
A town we all know well  
And every Sunday evening  
In her home I'd dwell  
We went to take an evening walk  
About a mile from town  
I picked a stick up off the ground  
And I knocked that fair girl down  
  
She fell down on her bended knees  
For mercy she did cry  
""Oh willy, dear, don't kill me yet  
I'm unprepared to die""  
She never spoke another word  
I only beat her more  
Until the ground around me  
With her blood did flow  
  
I took her by her golden curls  
And I dragged her 'round and 'round  
Throwing her into the river  
That flows from Knoxville town  
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl  
With your dark and roving eyes  
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl  
You can never be my bride  
  
I started back to Knoxville  
Got there about midnight  
My mother, she was worried  
She woke up in a fright  
Saying, ""dear son, what have you done  
To bloody up your clothes?""  
I told my anxious mother  
That I was bleeding in my nose  
  
I called for me a candle  
And I called for me a bed  
And I called for me a handkerchief  
To bind my aching head  
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through  
All horrors I did see  
The devil stood at the foot of my bed  
Pointing his finger at me  
  
They carried me down to Knoxville  
And put me in a cell  
My friends all tried to get me out  
But none could grow my bail  
I'm here to waste my life away  
Down in this dirty old jail  
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl  
The girl I loved so well

Says I should go home alone  
But you keep leaning in on me  
And you're lookin' pretty pissed  
That grave you've dug between  
Your legs is hard to resist

A cold winter night  
My baby and I, we began to fight  
I heated up, and I grabbed my gun  
I get so cold on those nights down south  
  
  
She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor  
She looked up at me and began to smile  
Her gasping words: ""Baby, I love you""  
Then she closed those baby blue eyes

Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night

Oh the sands, my lovely creature  
And the mad, moaning winds  
At night the deserts writhed  
With diabolical things  
Through the night, through the night  
The wind lashed and it whipped me

He said, that in the end it is beauty  
That is going to save the world, now

Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria  
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair  
Up against the pink and purple wisteria  
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me  
With some unrighteous intention?  
My knees went weak,  
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts  
That were not in my best interests to mention  
  
And she moves among the flowers  
And she floats upon the smoke  
She moves among the shadows  
She moves me with just one little look  
  
You took me back to your place  
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit  
You played the patriot, you raised the flag  
And I stood at full salute  
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb  
And made it impossible to speak  
As you closed in, in slow motion,  
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek  
  
She moves among the shadows  
She floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the candles  
And we moved through the days  
And through the years  
  
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea  
Half delirious  
You smiled at me and said, Babe  
I think this thing is getting kind of serious  
You pointed at something and said  
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?  
It was then that I broke down  
It was then that you lifted me up again

And I'm full of wonder  
And I'm full of love  
And I'm falling under  
Your spell  
  
I have no abiding memory  
No awakening, no flaming dart  
No word of consolation  
No arrow through my heart  
Only a feeble notion  
A glimmer from afar  
That I cling to with my fingers  
As we go spinning wildly through the stars  
  
And I'm full of love  
And I'm full of wonder  
And I'm full of love  
And I'm falling under  
Your spell  
  
The wind lifts me to my senses  
I rise up with the dew  
The snow turns to streams of light  
The purple heather grows anew  
I call you by your name  
I know not where you are  
But somehow, somewhere, sometime soon  
Upon this wild abandoned star  
  
And I'm full of love  
And I'm full of wonder  
And I'm full of love  
And I'm falling under  
Your spell

Nick Cave,Stranger Than Kindness,/n/nick+cave/stranger+than+kindness_20591203.html,"Stranger than kindness  
Bottled light from hotels  
Spilling everything  
Wet hand from the volcano  
Sobers your skin  
Stranger than Kindness  
You caress yourself  
And grind my soft cold bones below  
Your map of desire  
Burned in your flesh  
Even a fool can come  
A strange lit stair  
And find a rope hanging there  
Stranger than kindness  
Keys rain like heaven's hair  
There is no home there is no bread  
We sit at the gate and scratch  
The gaunt fruit of passion  
Dies in the light  
Stranger than kindness  
Your sleeping hands journey  
The loiter  
Stranger than kindness  
You hold me so carelessy close  
Tell me I'm dirty  
Stranger than kindness

Nick Cave,Supernaturally,/n/nick+cave/supernaturally_20483119.html,"Through the windswept coastal trees  
Where the dead come rising from the sea  
With a teddy-bear clamped between her knees  
She says, where can my loverman be?  
Well, I'm down here, babe, with the Eskimos With the polar bears and the
Arctic snow  
With a party of penguins who do not know flow  
How I can get back to thee  
Well I'm gonna ask you, babe  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Once I was your hearts desire  
Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire  
With my knuckles dragging through the mire  
You float by so majestically  
You're my north, my south, my east, my west  
You are the girl that I love best  
With an army of tanks bursting from your chest  
I wave my little white flag at thee  
Can you see it, babe?  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Now I've turned the mirrors to wall  
I've emptied out the peopled halls  
I've nailed shut the windows and locked the doors  
There is no escape, you see  
I chase you up and down the stairs  
Under tables and over chairs  
I reach out and I touch your hair  
And it cuts me like a knife  
For there is always something  
Other little thing you gotta do  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally

Nick Cave,Sweetheart Come,/n/nick+cave/sweetheart+come_20612137.html,"Come over here, babe  
It ain't that bad  
I don't claim to understand  
The troubles that you've had  
But the dogs you say they fed you to  
Lay their muzzles in your lap  
And the lions that they led you to  
Lie down and take a nap  
The ones you fear are wind and air  
And I love you without measure  
It seems we can be happy now  
Be it better late than never  
  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come to me  
  
The burdens that you carry now  
Are not of your creation  
So let's not weep for their evil deeds  
But for their lack of imagination  
Today's the time for courage, babe  
Tomorrow can be for forgiving  
And if he touches you again with his stupid hands  
His life won't be worth living  
  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come  
Sweetheart, come to me  
  
Walk with me now under the stars  
For it's a clear and easy pleasure  
And be happy in my company  
For I love you without measure  
Walk with me now under the stars  
It's a safe and easy pleasure  
It seems we can be happy now  
It's late but it ain't never  
It's late but it ain't never  
It's late but it ain't never
