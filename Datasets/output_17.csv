Phil Collins,You Can't Hurry Love,/p/phil+collins/you+cant+hurry+love_20108022.html,"I need love, love  
Oh, ease my mind  
And I need to find time  
Someone to call mine  
  
My mama said, ""You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait""  
She said, ""Love don't come easy  
But it's a game of give and take""  
  
You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes  
  
How many heartaches must I stand  
Before I find the love to let me live again  
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on  
When I feel my strength, oh, it's almost gone  
  
I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait""  
She said, ""Love don't come easy  
It's a game of give and take""  
  
How long must I wait  
How much more must I take  
Before loneliness  
Will cause my heart, heart to break  
  
No, I can't bear to live my life alone  
I grow impatient for a love to call my own  
But when I feel that I, I can't go on  
Well, these precious words keep me hanging on  
  
I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait""  
She said, ""Love don't come easy  
Well, it's a game of give and take""  
  
You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes, now break  
  
Now love, love don't come easy  
But I keep on waiting  
Anticipating for that soft voice  
To talk to me at night  
For some tender arms  
Hold me tight  
I keep waiting  
Oh, till that day  
But it ain't easy  
(Love don't come easy)  
No, you know it ain't easy  
  
My mama said, ""You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait""  
She said, ""Love don't come easy  
But it's a game of give and take""  
  
You can't hurry love  
No, you'll just have to wait  
She said, ""Love don't come easy  
It's a game of give and take""

Phil Collins,You Touch My Heart,/p/phil+collins/you+touch+my+heart_20108098.html,"Somehow you reach in and you touch my heart  
Somehow you reach in, you touch my soul  
When I look at you, I see everything we could be  
  
Eyes wide open, looking at me  
What can I offer you that you've never seen  
Just don't be afraid, someone is watching  
You will see  
  
Somehow when you smile the day seems brighter  
Somehow when you smile you melt my heart  
When I look at you I see all things we should be  
  
And in your darkest hour, hold out your hand for me  
Something will guide you, I'll be beside you  
And when it's rough out there, I'm with you everywhere  
I will be right behind you if you should fall  
  
Someday you will find everything you look for  
Someday you will find a love like mine  
When you smile at her you will feel the things you could be  
  
Eyes wide open, looking at me  
What can I offer you that you've never seen  
Just don't be afraid, someone is watching  
You will see, you will see

It will be alright  
Just take my hand  
Hold it tight

From all around you  
I will be here  
Don't you cry  
  
For one so small,  
You seem so strong  
My arms will hold you  
Keep you safe and warm  
This bond between us  
Can't be broken

You'll be here  
In my heart  
Always  
  
Why can't they understand the way we feel  
They just don't trust what they can't explain  
I know we're different, but deep inside us  
We're not that different at all  
  
And you'll be in my heart  
Yes you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
Don't listen to them  
'Cause what do they know  
We need each other, to have, to hold  
They'll see in time, I know  
  
When destiny calls you, you must be strong  
I may not be with you  
But you got to hold on  
They'll see in time, I know  
We'll show them together  
  
'Cause you'll be in my heart  
Believe me, you'll be in my heart  
I'll be there from this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
You'll be in my heart  
You'll be here in my heart

You've been in love and I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
  
She's getting to used to your face, getting too used to your smile  
She's saying the same things every morning before you leave her  
  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind  
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind

You've been in love and I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
  
Suddenly she's trying to please you, you start to think she's acting strange  
And after all these years she wears make-up in the morning  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind  
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind  
  
Did you really believe she's doing it all for you?  
Oh, can't you see, there's somebody else  
You never showed it, you should have known it  
  
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love  
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love  
  
Going round singing all those love songs, songs you haven't heard for years  
You're gonna have to ask her why she's so happy  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind.  
But it may be too late, and I know why  
  
You've been in love that little bit too long

I have no idea what your talking about  
I've got as much rhythm as that chair  
What happened to me was a tragedy  
But I don't have to be a millionaire  
Look I got a sweet deal going on here  
I've got all the books that I can read  
All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80's

I think perhaps that your not listening  
I find it tedious to repeat  
It's no big crime  
I just can't keep time

New Year's is a lot of noise

Halloween's a horror,

That I really don't hate Christmas!  
  
You see Flag Day is infernal.  
April Fool's is just a bore.  
Mardi Gras a waste  
Unless you own a candy store.  
All these other holidays

It makes me tense!  
  
From the evil scientist community  
I'm sure to get ejected.  
But for Christmas I can seem to summon  
Any true invective.  
Because what is there to hate?  
I mean it's really so subjective!  
Though I really don't hate Christmas.  
  
I hate puppy dogs and kittens,  
I hate flowers in the Spring!  
I even hate the sunshine  
And the birdies when they sing.  
I can work up animosity for almost anything  
Tell me why I don't hate Christmas.  
  
Though my childhood was atrocious,  
Christmas never was that bad, you see!  
So the best that I can muster  
Is complete and total apathy.  
What's wrong with me?  
  
How can I prove that I'm  
An evil villain worth his salt  
When with a holiday so jolly  
I can't even find a fault?  
If I didn't feel ambiguous  
I'd launch a big assault!  
But I really don't hate Christmas!  
  
... Ah what the heck? Kick line!  
  
No I really...  
No I really don't hate Christmas!

Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy,  
Or climbing up the Eiffel tower,  
Discovering something that doesn't exist,  
Or giving a monkey a shower  
Surfing tidal waves, creating nano-bots,  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain,  
Finding a Dodo bird, painting a continent,  
Or driving our sister insane

better,  
So make every minute count jump up, jump in and seize the day,  
And let's make sure that in every single possible way,  
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!  
  
Crossing the tundra or building a roller coaster.  
Skiing down a mountain of beans,  
Devising a system for remembering everything,  
Or synchronizing submarines, racing chariots,  
Taming tiger sharks, constructing a portal to mars,  
Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree, or wailing away on guitars,  
  
This could possibly be the best day ever,

We may miss dinner, but I know mom will understand...  
We got our mission and suppliers, purple gumballs and desires,  
A pocket full of rubber bands, the manual on handstands,  
A unicycle compass, and a camera that wont focus,  
And canteen full of soda, grab a beach towel here we go! (this is Ferb-tastic)

Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch,  
Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze,  
My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways,  
I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs,  
I pulled the witch from out the ditch and turned to face the furry thugs,  
The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam,  
The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream,

So softly then I heard a voice  
You seemed to hear it too  
Then walked on resolutely like  
It wasn't meant for you  
  
But when it came again I stopped  
The voice among the trees  
Came flowing sweetly louder now  
In tones designed to please  
Again you pulled upon my arm,  
""You have to listen now""  
And as you spoke, a chill went through me,  
Freezing me somehow  
  
""The woodland folk and forest creatures living in this glade,  
Have asked me to bring people here for this I am well payed  
The silent song will capture you, enrapture you and then,  
You'll grow roots and bark and leaves, and I'll bring back more men""  
  
""But why"", I asked, not quite aware of what was going on,  
I saw your movements move urgently, but words were drowned in song  
""You are different though"", she said, ""you have something to say,  
It was a big mistake to take you here, let's run away. ""  
  
I tried to run, but couldn't, my head was bathed in sound,  
And I looked down and saw my legs two feet beneath the ground.  
My toes were roots, my fingers twigs, my skin was scaley bark  
And as into an oak I changed, I watched you in the dark  
Completing your transaction with the nebulous green crowd,  
Of tiny dancing forest people, singing very loud.  
  
A celebration for a tree, and then I understood,  
My initial feelings in this melancholy wood  
I know I felt the change in you, when we finally kissed,  
I looked but you were surrounded by, a tapestry of mist  
  
I picture you, as wind blows through our leaves and over land,  
Every tree that stands with me for money changing hands.

hilltop above the war torn forests of Gamehendge spots a group of loyalists

beside him, loaded down with a canvas pack that holds two large bazooka type

If I could sneak around myself, again I'll know I've won

Are little golden strands of truth, that glimmer in the light

Time touched her wounds  
And shelter proved the cure

And liberate the spirit

'Are they worms or are they serpents? ' bubbles through the ice  
The source was quite invisible, the ever-present voice  
While skating, both legs tracing different shapes, I made my choice  
  
Mimicking the image in whose radiance at bask  
I'm tied to him, or him to me, with anything you ask  
None the less reluctantly reflections tumble in  
I slide with all the other on the wrong side of the skin  
  
He's falling on the ice, it cracks  
Will he plunge in and join me here?  
He meets my eyes, to my surprise  
He laughs in full light of my frown  
My double wants to pull me down  
  
Slipping on the friction slide, my skin peels to the bone  
The flesh I leave behind, is something that is not my own  
I beg my mirror image for a moment with my soul  
He's bleeding back, time to attack, it's me who's in control  
  
But every move I make he's got a hand up just in time  
He's throwing several punches, and he's blocking most of mine  
Defeated now I sulk and squirm in pollen and frozen mice  
Waiting, calculating till next he ventures on the ice.

She was searching for some cash

Whom she'd met at a Hollywood bash  
  
The second that he saw her  
He said, ""I bet you're in need  
Of some dough""  
Perplexed and confused she asked him,

And she's known throughout the world  
But life's no bed of roses  
She would change things if she could  
She plans to make a brand new start  
And move out of Hollywood  
  
The Captain now was grinning  
He felt he had her in the palm of his hand  
He said, ""Darlin' you're a penniless woman  
And I'm a wealthy man""  
You know the rules of the game by now  
I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine  
He said, ""Let me take you out  
And we'll talk about this  
Over a bottle of wine""  
  
The Swiss Miss Girl was disgusted  
And she smacked him right in his face  
Then she took his hat  
And she stamped on that  
Just to put him in his place  
But the old man was persistent  
He would not be undaunted  
The more that he'd been taunted  
The more she turned him on  
  
Then the Captain made a pass at the Swiss Miss Girl  
Tryin' to show her his affection  
She screamed for help And when she did...  
Mr. Clean came to her protection

And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,  
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.  
  
And after a while, you can work on points for style.  
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,  
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.  
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,  
So that when they turn their backs on you,  
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.  
  
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.  
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older.  
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,  
Hide your head in the sand,  
Just another sad old man,  
All alone and dying of cancer.  
  
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.  
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.  
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around.  
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,  
Dragged down by the stone.  
  
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.  
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.  
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.  
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?  
  
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.  
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  
And everything's done under the sun,  
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Who was given a pat on the back  
Who was breaking away from the pack.  
Who was only a stranger at home.  
  
Who was ground down in the end.  
Who was found dead on the phone.  
Who was dragged down by the stone.

And casting it's shroud  
Over all we have known  
  
Unaware how the ranks have grown  
Driven on by a heart of stone  
We could find that we're all alone  
In the dream of the proud  
  
On the wings of the night  
As the daytime is stirring  
Where the speechless unite  
In a silent accord  
  
Using words you will find are strange  
And mesmerized as they light the flame  
Feel the new wind of change  
On the wings of the night  
  
No more turning away  
From the weak and the weary  
No more turning away  
From the coldness inside  
  
Just a world that we all must share  
It's not enough just to stand and stare  
Is it only a dream that there'll be  
No more turning away?

Be quiet  
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot  
Shh

Now let the beat ride  
  
I'm rolling  
Through the backstreets  
Them boys don't applaud  
But they clap heat  
I'm in that seven forty fizzle  
With them dark boys on it low key  
Blowing that oh-ee  
Jump out They like who's he?  
I'm a snatch about two or three  
It's a Dade thing when you speak cocaine  
Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang  
I'm stating facts  
This where we from  
The bottom dog  
This where you come  
When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought  
Looking for a good price  
Hit ninety five south  
K's as in kilos  
P's as in pounds  
E as in ex,  
We got it on deck  
So show some respect  
To the cocaine capital  
Dade County bitch!  
  
Shh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot  
I'm cool, I'm quiet  
A couple shots will put yo ass on a diet  
This is for them big boys  
Doing them big things  
In the big Chevy's  
With them big rims  
Making big noise  
With them big speakers  
And anytime they cook yay  
Its some big beakers  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
I suggest you hand over them thangs  
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torres  
Ese si era mi consorte  
And I missed ya dad  
But I know you watching me  
With you in heaven  
I know ain't stopping me  
The game is mine now  
I'm building  
I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld  
Sign, seal, deliver, its done  
Ready or not, here I come

Pitbull,Blood Is Thicker Than Water,/p/pitbull/blood+is+thicker+than+water_20560737.html,"I know y'all listen to my music (red eyes)  
But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all  
  
Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it  
My life is upside down  
A gift and a curse that's my life now  
There is no looking or turning back  
I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap  
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate  
Confused but blessed with extravagance  
I thank god for all the opportunities  
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)  
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves  
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling  
Me for a quarter of what I make  
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is)  
Most of these fools are characters  
Men with no character welcome to America  
Where we fight for freedom  
If ain't about oil than we don't need them  
Ain't that the truth?  
Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell  
Thank god that god made me to keep it real  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)  
  
Huh hun yo  
After the turf war the smoke clears  
All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here  
In the past four years of my lifetime  
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline  
Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress  
Facing the table and she's snorting up white line  
Blood is thicker than water  
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit
case  
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running  
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming  
I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment  
The city gangs planning retirement  
I'm a a Dade nigga  
Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick  
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti  
As these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dog, and she hound  
Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I escape poverty (poverty)  
I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property  
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia (but but but)  
Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me  
Like good coke I'm a good swimmer  
God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner  
It feels great to make something out of nothing  
Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons  
And watch how them thing get to dumping  
Real estate New York game now you saying something  
I only talk about what I know about  
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about  
I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie  
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride  
I was confused now I'm like let's ride  
Three o five till I die  
Three o five till I die

Must be nice  
Having someone who's slow to take and quick to give  
Must be nice  
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick  
Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion  
Must be nice  
Having someone who loves you despite your faults  
Must be nice  
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho'  
You just remember to never let 'em go  
  
[Chorus]  
Even when your hustling days are gone  
She'll be by your side still holding on  
Even when those 20's stop spinning  
And all those gold-digging women disappear  
She'll still be here  
  
[2nd Vrs]  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work  
Must be nice  
Having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts  
Must be nice  
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard  
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird  
Must be nice  
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho'  
You just remember to never let 'em go

You drunk off that rum,  
You shouldn't drive tonight,  
Give me the key to that Beamer,

She said her brother just came home  
From the jungle

It makes me wonder  
How I keep from goin under  
With all these around me.  
I got em all colors, shapes and sizes,  
I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.  
Spike lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'jungle
fever'.  
'cause I like em a little bit darker  
Take it from the back to the front, rosa parkuh  
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference  
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy  
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen  
Coffee with no cream,  
That's like a rock with no fiend  
Martin Luther king with no dream,  
John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing  
And for those that don't know nothin,  
Welcome to the jungle,  
'Clef tell em somethin

If you got that hot blood  
Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente,  
Turn around now back up,  
Preparate mujer porque mi lengua esta fuerte,  
Morenita que rica esta,  
She don't speak Spanish, ay mama,  
That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya,  
And by the end of the night you'll say ay papa.  
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women  
Light skin red bones they blow my mind  
I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em  
Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine  
Stop playin with me  
Say it with me,  
Dale papi, dale papi oh

Welcome to the jungle,  
'Clef tell em somethin

It's that jungle fever  
Fever  
Watch out watch out  
It's that jungle fever  
  
Now what I'ma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall,  
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,  
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,  
What it means is, uh  
To get nasty  
To get freaky  
To do things you've never done before  
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.  
Whites, black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea.

Cause I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you (yeah)  
Every hour solemn I need you  
Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do  
There's so much to give  
If only I had my hands to fix what you did  
So I hold it inside watch as it dies

Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here

Still dealing with the death of my best friend

Your open arms of love I have found

Caught in a world of selfish cares  
But when You found me something changed  
My eyes were opened, now I will never

Nothing high class in my glass  
Only bottles of pop  
My bottles are popped so when I pop up in the spot  
I'm probably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc  
I'm not Puffy but I'ma run this city tonight  
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot  
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights  
Little indignity, hot diggity  
This Biggie is gettin' me hype  
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you  
I'll knock a dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse  
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial  
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel  
Hangin' from the light fixture  
I hope you pricks are insured for this building  
'Cause we're tearin' it down, security get out  
The frickin' way, Jesus Chrysler Lebaron it's loud  
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound  
Of sirens going eeeeeh cause...

Set off your sirens oh oh

Set off your sirens oh oh

What will you do, now all your fears  
Came true  
You had my heart, you had my soul  
You had it all- didn't you  
'Cause I'm sick of tryin' I'm goin' home  
Back to Philly where I come from  
And you can stay here and spend your  
Whole life running, but baby it's  
Time to move on  
You didn't wanna work it out, no  
You just wanted the easy route  
  
[Chorus(out)]  
You threw your hands up and walked away  
When times got hard you always walked away  
Well sorry baby but I'm leavin'  
It was just too hard for you to talk to me  
Now's my turn I'm gonna do the same  
I'm gonna do the same  
I'm gonna walk away  
I'm gonna walk away  
How does it feel baby?  
I'm gonna walk away

sound like and I'm wondering how you've been  
I cried myself to sleep back on the floor unconscious in denial

To get it's point across it beats you 'til your black and blue  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
'Cuz when your through your through  
  
There's a cafe round the corner from the home I call a house  
I sit and play sudoku 'til I figure some shit out  
I drink the days first coffee and I smoke  
The last cigarette of my life  
  
And I'm wondering out of all the crazy places that I've been  
Would it ever be as good as sitting here just with a friend  
Where it's always understood it might be time  
To switch the coffee to the wine

And all my friends have asked the question  
""baby will you be ok""  
I wanna tell them yes 'cuz I know that's what I should say  
But I've got no crystal ball and I can't bring myself to lie and why should I?

On a rainy night in Soho

You told me all your joys

To all those little girls and boys

The ginger lady by my bed  
Covered in a cloak of silence  
I hear you talking in my head

I'm not talking of the first time

The last time that I travelled on  
The Boat Train  
  
I had a couple of drinks in town

They helped me to a table  
Poured whiskey down my throat  
They sat me at a table  
And I lost my watch and coat  
  
First we drank some whiskey  
Then we drank some gin  
Then we drank tequila  
I think that's what did me in  
Then we drank some brandy  
And the women had a dance  
The steward then announced  
That we could play the game of ""chance""  
  
We crowded round the table  
With our money in our hands  
I ended up on the other side  
Without a penny in my pants  
I woke up in the toilet  
When we got to Holyhead  
The doors were all a-banging  
And I wished that I was dead  
  
We got on board the train  
And then we had a drink or two  
Started playing poker  
But the booze ran out at Crewe  
Some people started sleeping  
Others looked for duty free  
Some bastard started singing  
""The little cottage by the Lee""  
He then sang ""Paper Roses""  
""Boolavogue"" ""Eileen Aru""  
Somebody started slagging off  
The Pakis and the Jews

Then I found some gin  
I sat down in the corner  
And I read the Daily News  
First I drank the whiskey  
Then I drank the gin

I stumbled and fell in the morning mist  
I fell and rolled in the hungry grass  
That tells the tale of a terrible past  
I screamed and ran and dreamt I fell  
Down in the depths of a freezing hell  
Four million people starved to death  
Could smell the curse on their dying breath  
Where no one ever wants to go  
Down in the ground where the dead men go  
To hell which is circular all around  
Down in the belly of the big cold ground  
The moving shadows were everywhere  
The very trees seemed to bend and stare  
I remembered the dunes on a Sligo shore  
Screamed and ran till I could run no more  
Over the fields and across the moor  
I ran in the house and slammed the door  
What the hell's that over there  
A putrefying corpse sitting in that chair  
Where no one ever wants to go

Been drunk as a skunk since I've been home

Mother pack me bags because I'm off to foreign parts

Trailing fingers through the phospor or asleep in flowers of foam  
From Macao to Acapulco from Havana to Seville  
We'll see monoliths and bridges and the Christ up on the hill  
An aria with the Russians at the piano in the bar  
With ice floes through the window we raised glasses to the Czar  
We squared off on a dockside with a couple a hundred Finns  
We dallied in the 'dilly and we soaked ourselves in gin

I crumpled under cudgel blows and finally came ashore  
I spent the next two years or more just staring at the wall  
We went to sea to see the world and what d'you think we saw?  
If we turned the table upside down and sailed around the bed  
Clamped knives between our teeth and tied bandannas round our heads  
With the wainscot our horizon and the ceiling as the sky

Now the only deck that I'd want to walk  
Are the stalks of corn beneath my feet

At nights we passed the bottle round and drank to our lost friends  
We lay alone upon our bunks and prayed that this would end  
A wall of moving shadows with rows of swinging keys  
We dreamed that whole Leviathans lay rotting in the weeds  
There's a sound that comes from miles away if you lean your head to hear  
A ship's bell rings on board a wreck when the air is still and clear  
And up above that means another angel's got his wings  
But all below it signifies is a ship's gone in the drink  
Now the only deck that I'd want to walk  
Are the stalks of corn beneath my feet  
And the only sea I want to sail

And gave to the poor  
He'd a hand and a heart

The stars were shining bright  
They robbed the Glendale train  
And the people they did say

Those dirty little cowards  
I wonder how they feel  
For they ate of Jesse's bread  
And they slept in Jesse's bed

When they heard of Jesse's death  
They wondered how he came to fall  
Well it was Robert ford in fact  
Who shot him in the back

I'm an American, boys, and I've come a long way,  
Born and bred in the USA  
So listen up close, I've got something to say  
Boys, I'm buying this round  
Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight  
And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right  
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight,  
If I have to spend my last pound  
  
When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain  
Met a little girl in the field canteen  
Painted her name on the nose of my plane  
Six more missions, I'm gone  
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might  
Then the warden came around yelling ""Turn out the lights""  
Death rainin' out of the London night  
We made love 'til dawn  
  
[Chorus:]  
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home  
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan  
They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone  
When Johnny comes marching home  
  
My P-47 is a pretty good ship  
And she took a round comin' cross the channel last trip  
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip  
Always got me through so far  
Well they can ship me all over this great big world  
But I'll never find nothing like my North End girl  
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir  
Soon as we win this war  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now my grandaddy sang this song  
Told me about London when the Blitz was on  
How he married grandma and brought her back home  
A hero thoughout his land  
Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego  
A couple Purple Hearts and I move a little slow  
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows  
About a place called Vietnam

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone,  
Madam,  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray,  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail,  
Madam,  
They strung her upon  
The old willow across the way,  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her head and cried,  
Madam,  
""Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.""

Watched the smoke curl in the mist  
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us  
Smiling at me  
  
I awoke alone and lonely  
In a faraway place  
The sun fell cold upon my face  
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell  
Turned to the wall  
Pulled the sheets around my head  
Tried to sleep, and dream my way  
Back to you again  
  
Count the days  
Slowly passing by  
Step on a plane  
And fly away

As the dawn birds sing  
On a cold and misty morning

Long shadows crawl across the plain  
The ghosts of night will disappear

The furnace blazed, the wheels they rolled  
On tracks of iron, straight and cold  
The silver moonlight danced  
  
The flames are in the fireman's eye  
Orange in the engines glow

Like a runaway train rolling down the track  
  
From here there's no turning back

My heart was an ocean  
  
You swam against the tide  
The time is past for grieving  
My tears have all run dry  
I'll leave you with my love  
  
And now I say goodbye  
The bottles broke the glasses are cracked  
The cards are all dealt and the chips have been stacked  
The lamp shades busted and the curtains are torn

Cursed the cars and the rain and the rolling grey sky  
I turned around turned my back on that town

No more sorrow  
No more waiting  
For illusive tomorrows  
There will be no more pain  
No more dying  
No more striving or strain  
No more pain  
  
My mind's eye remembers the trouble I've seen  
All I have been through,  
And how I long to be free  
But I learn by her patience that I need her resolve  
To wait for the opening of eternity's halls  
And I know that in time we will stand side by side  
When Jesus comes back receiving his bride

Somewhere in the dark  
His words cut the silent night  
Take my hand, for the child  
That you carry is God's own  
And though it seems the road is long  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For in our arms, we'll cherish Him  
We're not that far, from Bethlehem  
Let us celebrate  
As the Christmas's go by  
Learn to live our days  
With our hearts near to the child  
Ever drawn, ever close  
To the only love that lasts  
And though 2000 years have passed  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him

Where all our hope and joy began

Well let me tell a story explain the shape I'm in  
The girl I had last night had never tasted sin  
So I took her to my hotel where I tried to get my way  
She said ""Wait a minute, Bret, there's something I must say...""  
  
She said 'If you wanna talk that's fine with me  
But if you want more you'd better let me be'

Ok, so I've been around the block  
But I am good at one thing  
And believe me it ain't talk

I've heard this all before  
Other girls might buy it  
But I don't, that's for sure""  
  
Now wait a minute baby  
I don't want you to go  
She said ""Don't get no closer  
The answer still is no""  
  
So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked  
Acted cool and smooth  
Got my hands around her shoulder  
Two inches from the move  
  
Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be  
So I finally made my move, she just said to me  
  
Cause you can look but you can't touch  
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap  
You can look but you can't touch  
Cause baby I ain't for keeps  
  
Let me show you something  
Mmm, let me set the pace  
Slid my hand up her leg  
As she slapped me across my face  
  
Can't blame a man for tryin'  
Wantin' action ain't a crime  
I didn't plan on spending money  
Just to get a piece of mind  
  
Solo  
  
So I started really thinkin'  
And I got myself a plan  
I opened up a cold beer  
And I handed her the can  
  
She drank it down real fast until she nearly choked  
Jumped up on my bed, tore off all her clothes and said  
  
Cause you can look but you can't touch  
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap  
You can look but you can't touch  
Cause baby I ain't for keeps  
  
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!

Love and hate  
To lose it all's  
A chance we take  
  
Come to me and take my hand  
It's in the fire that we must stand  
I'll take you down under my gun  
Our flesh and blood will be as one

The less you need the more I'm gonna give you

You like your tan but you don't like to swim

Neon sex and doom

Something was sticky on your shag rug, look at the tile

I rubbed my face in the sweat that ran down his chest  
It was all very run of the mill  
But I noticed his scent started to change somehow  
His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow

Bondage to lust, abuse of facility  
Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee  
I was sure his intentions were sweet  
And that mine was as well

I pledge to you my love tonight.  
But I will not hesitate to euthanize if the grass becomes greener on the other
side.  
Said the carpenter to the dainty bride,  
I would never do a thing to jeopardize this union I consider prize,  
Grass never will be greener on the other side.  
To the preacher man said the dainty wife,  
He thought the grass was greener on the other side.  
So I buried in his belly my butcher knife and ended these years of wretched
strife.  
Said the preacher man to the guilty wife,

Father's eyes  
And the grass just may be greener on the other side.

All around the conversations  
Icing on the warm flesh cake  
  
Light creeps through her secret tunnels  
Sucked into the open spaces  
Burning out in sudden flashes  
Draining blood from well-fed faces  
  
Desires form in subtle whispers  
Flex the muscles in denial  
Up and down its pristine cage  
So the music, so the trial  
  
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens  
Dance in circles, they the blessed  
Man and wife, undressed by all  
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed  
  
Even as the soft skins tingle  
They mingle with the homeless mother  
Who loves the day but lives another  
That once was hers  
  
The worried father, long lost lover  
Brushes ashes with his broom  
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover  
Bursting over the bride and groom  
  
And the talk goes on  
  
Memories crash on tireless waves  
The lifeguards whom the winter saves  
  
Silence falls the guillotine  
All the doors are shut  
Nervous hands grip tight the knife  
In the darkness, till the cake is cut  
Passed around, in little pieces  
The body and the flesh  
The family and the fishing-net

Of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said, we have nothing to fear but  
Fear itself.  
  
Paranoia is a disease unto itself, and may I add, the person standing  
Next to you, may not be who they appear to be, so take precaution.  
  
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, this is true any a young person  
Has fallen prey, to the substances that alter the perspective of any  
Right thinking individual.  
  
The problem with the youth today is, because of their inexperience  
With the world, they cannot attempt to grasp the ideals, set forth by  
Myself and those who preceded me.  
  
But, as history has shown, they will come around, and embrace our  
Philosophies and become model citizens in their own right, God bless

Badly shattered, gale force frighty

Chopped up, churned out weeks of greazy  
Spark plugs burned up, power's fused

I'm lost amidst a sea of wheat  
Where people speak but seldom meet  
And grief and laughter, strange but true  
Although they die, they seldom cry  
  
An ode by any other name I know might read more sweet  
Perhaps the sun will never shine upon my field of wheat

For those too sick, too sick to see  
Though nothing shows, yes, someone knows

You see this guy fly up in the sky, thought to myself, 'Why shouldn't I?'  
So I bought a pair of wings, went up upon a wall  
I was about to jump into the air when a guy from the street called  
He said, 'Hey wait a minute! Don't you realize the danger?  
What do you think you are, some kind of angel?'  
  
I considered for a minute, realized he spoke the truth.  
For the barbells on my eyelids only emphasized my youth  
And the sawdust in my plimsolls means the same to him as me  
But that's neither here nor further, so I spoke considerately  
Now if you understand just what I'm trying to say,  
Whatever you do, don't grin, you'll give the game away!'  
  
By now a crowd had gathered and it seemed that all was lost  
In the anger of the moment I had diced with death and lost  
It seemed to me the time was right so I burst into song  
In the anger of the moment the crowd began to sing along  
I could not see a way out of this predicament  
Just then a breeze came through the trees and up in the air I went  
  
I must have flown a mile, or maybe it was eight  
Thought to myself pretty soon I'd hit the Golden Gates  
Just then a passing bird for no reason I could see  
Took a peck at my wings and that was the end of me  
I went down, hit the ground faster than the speed of sound  
Luckily I broke no bones only tore my underclothes

Come on, America, ain't no barriers  
Free the strings, let's see how freedom rings  
One nation all gettin' down for the dollars  
And the heat is gettin' hotter

Just the way some plan to break you  
I done seen the whole thing go straight through  
Hungry for it, I'ma make you  
Pay back what's due to me  
Everybody gonna see, look what they put upon me  
Made me a monster, two steps beyond ya  
More streets to wonder  
For which it stands for cause let's get it  
Cause I'ma get mine for damn sure, come on

Screens, greens car candy painted  
Chicks in cream is the American dream, ain't it?  
I pledge allegiance to Beamers, dark skies  
Sleepless nights on the block, two for fives  
Deep in the struggles but need the hustle  
Weed and blow shit I make the block bubble  
I'm to the point where I'm playa hatin'  
Fool in the stash and I'm losin' my patience  
Medieval times in the chest of the beast  
Come around sniffin' I'ma mess up ya fleece  
Job lookin' I'd rather be pot cookin'  
It's not America, son this is Brooklyn  
Home of the shiesty, home of the crook  
We signed joints, ain't scared to do a took  
My country tis of thee, where there's no liberty  
Just misery, ya heard me

If six dead people run this country  
Now they come cause my crew's too large

Runnin' around here like you is God  
Then they wonder why the shootin' starts  
Gettin' checks with half my stacks  
I forgot George Bush wrote half my raps  
Murderin' people for blastin' facts  
Then blamin' other cats for their tragic acts

Cops is like freeze and I'm already frozen

Every day's training day

What chu' want those is me of the block  
Yo, so you can serve fiends everytime they knock  
Just last summer had the mad Hummer  
They took that and didn't even give me they badge number

[Diddy]  
The world at my sneakers,  
Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features,  
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether,  
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for,  
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh,  
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper,  
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,  
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,  
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,  
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle,  
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,  
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,  
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,  
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest,  
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project,  
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,  
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja  
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra,  
It's Harlem usa I diddy bop and shop with Oprah,  
(Yeah nigga, what.)  
  
[Cee-lo, Chorus]  
  
Nigga what,  
From my voice I'm killing 'em,  
I she'd my blood,  
About everything I love,  
  
[Diddy]  
To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker,  
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer,  
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster,  
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha,  
I call it rich ignorant laughter,  
Black American express card all grey now, it's scratched up,  
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags,  
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra,  
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya,  
Bring friends wontcha?  
I'm from the 80's nyc 5 percent of culture,  
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,  
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing,  
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her,  
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,  
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar,  
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,  
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,  
(Yeah nigga, what.)

Nigga what,  
From my voice I'm killing 'em,  
I she'd my blood,  
About everything I love,

The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker,  
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber,  
Heister, my own life biographer,  
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping,  
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,  
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers,  
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me,  
Draped in paisley bandanas,  
Suits with Adam Stacey,  
Cigar like dick Tracy,  
Its dark I get spacey,  
Alcohol and laced weed,  
That was part of my 80's,  
The Cartier consigieres be near me,  
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,  
Liz Taylor tried to joke me  
Coz I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be  
When he gets mean,  
Think fast before I blast hoes,  
Like Grassino,  
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion,  
And realest rappin',  
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,  
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas,  
Two of New York's biggest niggaz,  
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us,  
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers.  
(Yeah nigga, what.)

And everything is still going right

In today to local police for an alleged assault and  
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on  
His own recognizance.  
[Puff]  
In my distress I prayed to the Lord  
And the Lord answered and rescued me  
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid  
What can mere mortals do to me  
Yes the Lord is for me  
He will help me  
I will look in triumph at those who hate me  
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people  
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes  
Though hostle nations surrounded me  
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
They swarmed around me like bees  
They blazed against me like roaring flames  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
The Lord is my strength and my song  
He has become my victory  
Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do

Puff Daddy,I Want You Back '98 (Bad Boy Mix),/p/puff+daddy/i+want+you+back+98+bad+boy+mix_20608944.html,"[Puff Intro]  
Yeah  
The old school  
To the new school  
Bad Boy, remix, let's go  
  
[Black Rob]  
Like that  
Black gon' slide with Mike Jack  
Puff done remixed one hell of a track  
Put me on it  
I wanna know  
How many want it?  
Damn, it feels good to see people love on it  
For those who love slow down  
'Member Motown had a brotha' happy as shit  
I mean the whole sound  
Bangin' and catch six-four since we was shorties  
Fee owes now rebooked from California  
  
Carry 40's but I 'member them times in '79  
When I first started to rhyme  
Sometimes I gots to look back at what it was  
The good old days  
The triple o'shays when there was love  
  
I want you back  
But I can't grab that far  
It's how it is  
When you're living like a star, bad boy  
Come on, let's go  
  
[Mj]  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces  
Always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
When love was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me  
(Back in your heart)  
Oh, darlin' I was blind to let you go  
(Let you go baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
(I want you back)  
Oh, I do now  
(I want you back)  
Oh, oh, baby  
(I want you back)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(I want you back)  
Nah, nah, nah, nah  
  
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want you around  
  
Let me tell ya now  
Oh baby all I need is one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me  
(Back in your heart)  
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go  
(Let you go baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
(I want you back)  
  
[Black Rob]  
It's just like Jermain Jackson  
Tito, Mike and Marlon  
Only think on my mind now is stardom  
Blowin' the F-up  
My game's stepped up  
'Member when Mike and them  
First came to record  
Singin' hits like Skywriter  
My Girl, People Make The World Go 'Round  
Mama's Pearl, Can't Loose it  
Joyful jukebox music  
Never Can Say Goodbye  
That's why we use it  
  
It's money honey  
So I gots to be there  
And I'mma be yo Sugar Daddy  
Say it's real  
Versachi chair, pd, life of the party  
Bad Boy, make joys for everbody  
  
Jackson 5 Chorus in background while:  
  
[Puff Daddy]  
Motown  
Berry Gordy  
History  
Let's go, come on  
Yeah  
Come on

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.  
Listen to me playboy, check dis out  
I go, on and on and on and  
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'  
PD call her on the phone and  
Promise I'll leave her moanin'  
Now she zonin'  
Tellin' me she's all alone and  
Love the dark chocolate tone and  
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes  
The cars and the chedda is mine  
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus  
Spit that mack-a-docious  
Most ferocious  
Cash all in my holsters  
Burn more bread than toasters  
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest  
Hip-hop quota but quote this  
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'  
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it  
  
[Chorus: Kokane]  
Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely  
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

Uh, uh, yeah  
Hey yo see-I-O-F-F-I-E  
Q-you-double E-N-Z  
Come on ma your riding with me  
Leave the lame respect the game  
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same  
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain  
I, only link with the wealthiest  
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius  
Now, you can run but you can never hide  
But, where you go when the temperature rise  
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes  
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise  
Damagin' shit hot stamina split  
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique  
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip  
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!  
  
[Chorus]  
[Mark Curry]  
Yo, yo, yo, yo  
Don't panic, don't take this for granted  
I did then still do and always ran it  
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain  
The shit I spit, burn flames  
Who's controllin' this  
I can make the bitches grin  
Cause I get money and run with the richest men  
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again  
Been down since the jump off begin  
You know who I am  
Don't get it all twisted up  
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up  
We can pick it up, we can drop it low  
Recognize what it is when I come through the door  
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp  
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since  
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan  
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man  
Get a grip niggas

Let's take it to the next millennium on these bitches  
You got to keep bubblin on em  
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas  
Hey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like,  
""Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice""  
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice  
You public enemy number one right now  
But Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit  
  
Let's go  
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear  
Throw your guns in the air  
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way  
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see  
But you wanna be you ain't shit to me  
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me  
Playa, my real dogs they'll spit for me  
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart  
I've seen em come and I've seen em part  
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?  
Front from the light catch shots after dark  
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these  
On the spot, red dots make em all believe  
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these  
See I do the things that they can't achieve  
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing  
Bets on that you'll be disgracing  
More hotter than the sun  
I'm living on the run  
Because i'm public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
Let me ask you, what you got against me?  
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?  
Is it my house or maybe its all three  
I just came up and you're all against me  
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?  
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?  
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?  
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one  
Always with God and I don't swing solo  
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo  
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though  
Pretty young things wanna have my photo  
One in the room hangin' on the wall  
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all  
Got no time for those that think small  
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball  
Hate shot callers  
Hate them ballers  
Back in control now I call orders  
It's no fun fleeing under the gun  
Cause they got me public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers  
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire  
I spit lines, hit rhymes  
Keep dimes sweating  
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'  
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor  
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer  
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor  
Before you try me, you better say your prayers  
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""  
You know that i'm gone then say don't die  
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme  
Thought it was over but I crept from behind  
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind  
Almost 2000 and running out of time  
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines  
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine  
Soldiers in position all on the front line  
Don't make a move till I give them the sign  
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son  
Because i'm public enemy number one  
  
One,One,One,One,One  
One,One,One,One,One  
  
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff  
That's what I'm talkin about love  
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers  
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches  
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got  
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down  
But fuck dat, they just mad  
Cause you got all the ladies  
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys  
You know? and thats just the way the story goes  
And thats just the way the story goes

Puff Daddy,Satisfy You,/p/puff+daddy/satisfy+you_20112061.html,"[Puffy]  
All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me  
Somebody I can love for them  
All this money don't mean shit  
If you ain't got nobody to share it with  
Love rules the world, you feel me  
1:  
[R. Kelly]  
He don't understand you like I do  
No he'll never make love to you like I do  
So give it to me  
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love  
And I can promise anything that I do  
Is just to satisfy you  
[Puffy]  
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame  
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner  
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but  
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game  
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you  
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you  
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through  
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you  
I could straight lace you, not just appearance  
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits  
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it  
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it  
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer  
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to  
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you  
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier  
Repeat 1  
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy  
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void  
When you spend time with your woman and listen  
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten  
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth  
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself  
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt  
And prove to you you're more important than anything else  
Worthwhile, special like my first child  
When I see your face it's always like the first time  
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet  
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet  
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you  
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to  
Let it be known, I told you  
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true  
Repeat 1  
[R. Kelly]  
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)  
Waiting for love like this too long  
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)  
All that you need I can give you  
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)  
I do, satisfy you  
(You don't have to wait on him)  
[Puffy]  
I'm the light when you can't see  
I'm that air when you can't breathe  
I'm that feeling when you can't leave  
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive  
So it's only you and me  
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong  
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong  
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected  
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected  
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare  
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared  
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you  
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you  
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil  
Make love all night, bending bed coils  
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal  
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you  
Repeat 1 until fade  
[Puff]  
This one right here goes out to all my  
Sisters

Run yo' city, and we not talkin marathons

What you have is a portion  
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and  
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and  
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing  
I don't really gotta talk son  
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements  
I'm a pro, kid  
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?

Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did

Still on the block and move pies like that  
Never my life dealt with guys that rap  
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad  
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up

The lean is on, the lean is on  
Oh, sooner or later, you're gonna catch heat  
There's no use running away  
Everything hurries to eat or be eaten, they say  
  
Oh, Papa was right, nothing rates higher  
The coolest of cool is grace under fire  
  
Back in the shadows there's the law of the city  
Work on the one who shows the first sign of pity  
I know, I know  
Well, they knock on your door, and they call out your number  
And your legs won't move, and you heart starts running  
You'll know, you'll know  
  
Oh, Papa was right, nothing rates higher  
The coolest of cool is grace under fire  
  
You've got to be the diamond, you've got to be the steel  
The lucky have ice in their veins,  
They laugh at the devil  
And burn like a torch in the rain  
  
Oh, The Jesus was cool, no one bet higher  
The measure of heart is grace under fire

A man holds me close but I never see who  
Babe, can't you see that  
I want to believe it's you  
  
It's easy to hide your heart away  
It's easy to never choose  
I've loved and I've lost and I've lost my way  
And now I'm afraid to lose  
But when you say that it's right  
That it's here tonight  
I'm ready to see it, too

When the storms are raging round you  
Stay right where you are

Yesterday's moments I remember  
It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall  
It's the mistier mists the hazier days  
The brighter sun and the easier lays  
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying  
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all  
  
It's the fantastic drowse  
Of the afternoon Sundays  
That bored you to rages of tears  
The unending pleadings  
To waste all your good times  
In thoughts of your middle-aged years  
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told  
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero  
And there's all the more reason  
For living or dying when you're young  
And your troubles are all very small  
  
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet  
And scuff up the sidewalk  
With endlessly restless feet  
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds  
More in the pool hall  
Than we did in the school hall  
With the down town chewing gum bums  
Watching the night life the lights and the fun  
  
Never wanted to be the boy next door  
Always thought I'd be something more  
But it ain't easy for a small town boy  
It ain't easy at all  
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong  
It's easier from an arm chair  
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness  
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess

Jimi Hendrix he was good

Out towards the rim  
Where stars are sparse  
And the cold of space seeps in

Drinking methylated gin

Did I live my life right?

come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me.""

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.""

When I was young and just getting started  
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted  
Then I grew up and got my imagination  
And all I wanted was to start a new relation  
So in love but love had a bad reaction

When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light  
But inside of your mind you put up a fight  
Where are the answers that we're all searching for  
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore  
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad  
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad  
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face  
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years

Queen Adreena,Are The Songs My Disease?,/q/queen+adreena/are+the+songs+my+disease_20308082.html,"(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
I used to know this wretched girl,  
I made her open for me,  
I took her heart,  
And I kissed it clean,  
But she still kicks against me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?  
Maybe she's creating me,  
Mistaken accidentally,  
For a girl I used to know,  
In darkness permanently,  
If I find her the perfect line,  
My sickness might desert me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?

Please hold me tight  
For the dead of night  
Prefers my suffering...

I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when  
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill  
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age  
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid  
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough  
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you  
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two  
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it  
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it  
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine  
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I  
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
It's so so simply done  
When I find that I have to run  
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King  
The words we bring I write, and sing  
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course  
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost  
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them  
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim  
To add to the list of aggrivation  
Subtracting suckers like a math computation  
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples  
This is a King and Queen creation  
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?  
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin  
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying  
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom  
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey  
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal  
He grabs it and starts bombing people  
Don't listen to me to figure me out  
Because you can't turn my mind inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority  
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority  
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me  
But I came here just to party  
If it's a show you want, the show it live  
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived  
When Mark requests my approval, I nod  
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God  
although a taste of my body would soothe you  
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you  
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it  
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it  
Latifah is a name meaning ""delicate and sensitive""  
But I have no problem formulating sentences  
To break you down to the ground  
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown  
And I am down, but never ever down and out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Jah know? Cause ah...  
Music, 45 King, music Latifah the Queen  
Music, domination to bring the world

Queen Latifah,The Pros,/q/queen+latifah/the+pros_20112743.html,"I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn  
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in  
A female walked up to me and said, ""Latifah bust a line""  
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time  
  
I said, ""If you really want to do this we can do this fine'  
Take six paces and begin to rhyme""  
As soon as attempted to make a sound  
I ate her up with the verb broke her down with the noun  
  
'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me  
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow  
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings  
  
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing  
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them  
Rhyme thieves, biters, and bums  
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight  
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!  
  
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one (What about the third?)  
He started, he started to run  
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped  
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step  
  
You see you may speculate, but everybody knows  
Not one amateur can deal with the pros  
  
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O  
And if you want to hear more then just follow  
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say ""Bo bo bo!""  
  
There was a time that a man could go  
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo  
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme  
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line  
  
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it  
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit  
So feel the flow, y'all because you're under attack  
From my rhymes, 'cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks  
  
And four words to the wack, just, ""Stay the hell back""  
Cause it's a fact, if you're wack you ain't saying jack  
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish  
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish  
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me  
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe  
  
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down  
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found  
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide  
How you want to be eaten, boy, baked or fried?  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream  
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing  
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound  
So button your lips and stop trying to be down  
  
I caught you out there (How many times?)  
A lot of times  
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme  
Stepping to the right, to the left  
To the best place, well I have to face  
  
A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft  
Riding my bra strap trying to get off  
Understand and know, if you want to go  
You'd better be ready to flow 'cause I'm a pro  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
We wax floors with bums, make mocks out of some  
Sting 'em hard, and watch them complain how it stung  
Kidnap the babysitter, lock 'em inside a box  
Daddy-O and the true blue Queen of Rock

From our own love life  
This has been denied  
Many feelins high  
Many tears of pride  
But by the weekend  
Let my spirit divide

Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday we'll change)

Just a case of weekend love

If you've been misled  
By anything I've said  
Didn't mean to turn you on  
The bite was oh so strong  
You've got things to do  
But I have got things too  
So I'll catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

??????????  
To nourish and cherish every moment  
To deliver the goods I am ???  
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients  
Till the weekend the days seems to be long  
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time  
Good things can come in a small bag  
So let's make use of the time that we have  
When we are together 'cause we stay popular  
???????????  
When we are together you and I wonder  
If this love is gonna last forever  
Well then I think and I start remember  
That we are a ? star

Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart  
  
And what love has joined together  
What love has joined together  
Can't nobody take it apart  
  
It would be easier to take the cold from snow  
Or the heat from fire  
Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby  
'Cause you're my heart's desire  
  
I really love you

I love you from the bottom of my heart  
  
And what love has joined together  
What love has joined together  
What love has joined together  
Can't nobody take it apart  
  
Even if they separate us  
A thousand miles apart  
We will still be together  
In each other's hearts  
  
It would be easier to change  
All the seasons of the year  
Than for anyone to change  
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear  
  
I really love you  
(I love you)  
Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart

Got a little motto  
Always sees me through  
When you're good to Mama  
Mama's good to you  
There's a lot of favors  
I'm prepared to do  
You do one for Mama  
She'll do one for you  
They say that life is tit for tat  
And that's the way I live  
So, I deserve a lot of tat  
For what I've got to give  
Don't you know that this hand  
Washes that one too?

Mama's good to you

Pepper my raggoo  
Spice it up for Mama

You put in for Mama  
She'll put out for you  
The folks a top the ladder  
Are the ones the world adores  
So boost me up my ladder kid  
And I'll boost you up your's

it happens whether we say.  
The old world order is over,  
intelligence and love win the day.  
I won't regret one moment  
life is too short for that, bring it on.  
Life goes on and around like a wheel,  
it keeps on turning, that's the deal.  
Why are we running?  
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind.  
Problems come and they go and  
in the end what will you show?  
Why are we worried?  
Why worry so much? Don't worry about falling behind.

Now all you do is hurt me, and think that everything is fine  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you

All by myself, taking little man to church  
So quick to hang up the phone, when I step, in the room  
Then you want to turn it all around, I'm gettin tired of playing fool

And even though the price for the house was so much  
I still roll with them from the hood like what up  
Cause when it comes to being the realest I'm sure 'nough  
I'm a straight up industry villain for sure 'nough  
And I can't satisfy some a y'all no matter what  
And some of y'all cats are so jealous

And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords  
And all these haters I keep shaking 'em off

You know what I'm saying  
To all the fellas that don't know what a hotti is  
I'm here to define the definition  
So check this out  
Yo here's the definition of a hotti  
A girl with Noxema skin and a V-8 body  
She can relate with your wildest dreams  
By wearing a short skirt or nice tight jeans  
She'll put you in shock and clean you up with clorox  
And then you'll say, damn, the hotti body is bare box  
Lipstick shining, earings glistening  
Yo listen to me as I kick the ballistics  
Last night, I went to a club, to a club  
To see if I could have myself some fun, yeah  
All the ladies, standing on the wall, standing on the wall  
I'm not leaving till I catch me one, till I catch me one  
Cuties, all the cuties  
So fine, so fine  
We could spend some time

The one, the one for me

R. Kelly,Did You Ever Think,/r/r+kelly/did+you+ever+think_10237510.html,"[Chorus]  
Did you ever think that you would be this rich  
Did you ever think that you would have these hits  
Did you ever think that you would be the don  
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn  
Did you ever think that you would be this paid  
Were there times when your ass was real afraid  
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours  
Have a show with fifty million viewers  
  
I used to think about how I was gonna make it  
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper  
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way  
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things  
Partied in every club nothing but VIP  
I never take for granted these luxuries I have  
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I used to play the game, at night the same old same  
Dreamin' 'bout city lights it was my only lie  
And now it's world wide shows  
As if I can fly on over  
Now I can't go nowhere without, before I do two more

Don't talk about it be about it  
I should have felt you when you said  
To me that you were all alone  
I act like I was doin' a favor  
For you 'cause you were wit me  
Something let me thinking that whatever happens  
This would be my home  
But I was wrong (I was wrong)  
How could I have been so low

I won't talk about both of us  
Cause I'm gonna be about both of us  
I won't talk about makin' sweet love  
Cause I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love  
  
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A  
Clothes and pallets on the floor makin' sweet love night till day  
Used to say I want to have a baby boy and call him Man

Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib  
Start off in my game room  
Pop a little bub  
Then have em dance for me like they danced in the club

Shots of tequila puff some dro and now they ready

Man I could tell they so naughty, naughty  
The way they took me down like a forty, forty  
One in the bed and one in the chair  
One massage my toes while one braid my hair  
  
In the private spot like two of these playas  
In the car lot like two of these playas  
Hatas saying damn how he doin' this playa

Came to light eventually

And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit  
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)  
  
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights  
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife  
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong  
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song  
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf  
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be dropped off

Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids

I can't take it no more I've got to confess  
See now, I don't know why  
I thought that I could keep creeping  
'cause you see what goes around  
Comes back on around and back on around  
And back on around again, yes it does  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
In a state of shock that's what it left me  
Take it from a man who knows  
That three ain't company  
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself  
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs  
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house  
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help  
Must be because of what my old man did to her

Blowin' out that purple smoke  
Open up that closet door  
Fresh shoes, fresh clothes  
Private jets  
Takin' trips  
Ballin' man  
Spinning chips  
Give that girl a gold medal  
The way she out there turning flips  
Bend it over (That's whats up)  
Now shake it nasty (That's whats up)

Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin'with  
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do  
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place  
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face  
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink  
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry  
All these questions deep inside my mind  
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama  
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why  
You were young, 45, and you had to die  
I'm always tryin' to help people out  
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth  
(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make  
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create  
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive  
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live  
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'  
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'  
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off  
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off  
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Still young tryin' to figure it out  
Heaven, I need a hug  
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug  
Feelin' like a change of heart  
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God  
So sh

Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.  
(Take ya time brother)  
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,  
Everywhere I go, and everything I see,  
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?  
(Talk on,talk on)  
While you're looking I suggest you take a good look'  
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for  
(Amen)  
  
Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do  
Now can I move on?  
(Move on, move on, move on brother Kelly)  
I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody  
(I didn't know nobody)  
But now  
(Now)  
I said now  
(Now)  
Can I say it again?  
(Gon' and say it again)  
Now, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little  
Bit different(yes it is)  
  
Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes,why,even the Statue of  
Liberty want some bump and grind  
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps (Amen)  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth  
Now-now, wait a minute, go that way  
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light,please, I think it's
time  
To turn on your lights and see the truth  
Can, Can I talk on?  
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know  
What I do.  
  
Can I get a witness?  
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself,  
Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going,  
And who yourself has been with  
That way, you

It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL  
It's Nas and R. Kell  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Never thought that I'd ever live this life  
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side  
Anything I want, I can say it's mine  
No more worries 'bout how can I provide  
  
Money makes the world go round  
(Nothin' move but the money)  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round

Oh, many say it's wrong cause I love to spend  
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins  
All I wanna do try, and let you know  
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke  
  
Money makes the world go round

You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does

(Money make the world go round, what?  
Still nuttin' move but the money)  
Nothing but the money  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does  
  
Feels so good, yeah, yeah  
So good, this life I finally live  
And feels so real  
So real this freedom I finally feel  
Show me the money  
  
Money makes the world go round  
(Go money, go money)  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
(Go money, go money, yo)  
Said that almighty dollar  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does  
(Still don't nuttin' move but the money)  
This brother's got to have it  
Money makes the world go round  
From sun up till the sun goes down  
(Yeah, what?)  
So much money  
  
Money makes the world go round  
Hey, makes the world go round  
Money makes the world go round  
  
Money makes the world go round  
Show me a man that don't need money  
Money makes the world go around  
And I'll show you a world

Rockland had loot before we signed the deal  
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal  
We used to use the streets for the football field  
In church free lunch was our only meal  
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels  
Living it up in Beverly Hills

Now the ladies want to find Tone in a hurry  
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry

Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice

Playas get lonely too... too...  
[Verse 1:]  
From, my iPhone to my sidekick  
Jet planes, schedule hectic  
My love life, I neglect it  
Had a fast car, but I wrecked it  
Plenty chances to fall in love man  
So many weekends, I went to clubs man  
In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick  
Let my drink decide, who is the next chick  
I ain't gone lie,all the blanck it matter to me  
She say she me love me, but it's just chit chatter to me  
But deep inside I was always missing something  
But I'm a thug so I'm always on something  
So many girls always drinking and having fun  
Life's a beauty shop and I keep my hair done  
Seem like I'm on a marry go ride  
Man it makes a thug wanna settle down,

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too... (... and you know I do)  
[Verse 2:]  
I wanna settle down with you  
Baby you and me  
A Life that's brand new  
Quit running these streets  
Take away your pain  
Chase away the rain  
Off my love game  
I might even change my name

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too..(oh I do)

Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too (... and you know I do)

Uh, uh V.I.P.  
Uh, uh R.O.B  
Always in the spot light  
Living the good life  
All of that something still just ain't right  
Videos and all of these interviews  
When all I really want is to be next to you  
I spend more time with my cars now  
Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now  
My life is more than the cars and awards  
It gets lonely and I can't ignore  
Always in the streets going hardcore  
I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too (oh I do)  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... (oh I do) too (... and you know I do)  
[Verse 4:]  
Party lights mixed with lonely  
Nights mixed with birds grass  
Flights mixed with,  
Nobody to share it with  
Out of all the, after parties  
I still need somebody  
To be there when a playa's going through some shit  
To be there when a playa can't ever see...  
[Chorus:]  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Holdin in my drop,tilling on top and it don't stop no...  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Every now and then I need somebody...  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too (oh I do,I do...)

Damper than the morning dew,tonight has chosen me and you  
And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true  
  
I can here the horns sounding,  
Bells ringing a full orchestra  
And the choir singing  
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing  
It feels so good, keep on going.

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.

The gift of joy is found in when I softly here you call my name  
Rose pedals, and all these oils, surrounded by a hundred candles,  
The eagle delivers a letter, that says this night will last forever.  
  
Damper than the morning dew,the night has chosen me and you  
And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come tru

An ocean filled with white sail boats and huge waterfalls that overflow

And imagine far away from here,  
Where the land cry's joyful tears,

You can try your whole life, but you can't save the unsaveably  
Untogether.  
I was shipwrecked with this frog who was constantly testing my faith.  
He made outrageous demands, I ignored him,  
Til I strapped on my bird feet and surfed into shore  
He's not touching me anymore.  
Untogether, I couldn't help him, I got hard.  
You can try your whole life,  
But you can't change the unchangeably  
Untogether.  
Now this bird nests on my back, keeps me turning and straining to see.  
We threw out-rageous parties, we were golden.  
Now the bird keeps her distance, and I keep my spleen.  
Sometimes there's no poison like a dream.  
Untogether, I couldn't help it, it got hard.  
You can dry your eyes,  
But you can't hold the impossibly  
Untogether

Died, drowning in the rage of battle.  
Mothers, half naked  
Infants clutching thier necks  
Running frantically  
Tripping over the bodies of their sons  
Teeth gnashing  
Swinging machete  
Spitting blood and mud, and screaming:  
Land, and liberty!  
Were erased.  
Buried and burned  
Along with the memory of the dead  
Along with the ejido.  
With the smooth stroke of a pen  
And with the ghost of nixon present in their eyes  
They smiled.  
And pronounced the omnipitence  
Of the free market  
The profits of profit  
Extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro  
The freedom to buy things you can never afford  
The freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their
backyards  
The freedom to die of curable disease  
The freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst  
The freedom to starve and die  
Without land  
Or liberty  
But ramona, with eyes of obsidian  
Peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask  
Darding, unseen  
Changing direction with the swiftness of a bird  
Through the shanty's of the canyon  
With every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life  
Urging her, propelling her forward.  
The leaves and branches of the forest  
Part for miles, clearing her path  
The voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet  
Echo in the deepest chasm of her soul  
Hurling her, toward the city  
History surging through her veins  
Pulsing through her fingers  
Hurling her, towards the city  
She caresses her trigger  
And the words of magome fulfil her being  
And with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement  
Saying:  
Enough! Enough!  
No!  
I will see my own blood flow  
Before you take my land... Or my liberty

Above all.  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me

Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall

And grace my fears relieved.

The hour I first believed!  
  
Through many dangers, toils, and snares  
I have already come.  
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,

I ain't going to study, no, no, no  
Study, study war no more  
Ain't going to study, no, no, no, study, no, no, no, no  
Study, study war no more  
  
I'm going to meet my loving mother down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm going to meet my loving mother down by the riverside  
I ain't going to study war no more  
  
I ain't going to study, study war no more

Randy Travis,Drive Another Nail,/r/randy+travis/drive+another+nail_20189471.html,"Sam was a carpenter fifty years  
He pounded out blood, sweat and tears  
One day he hung his hammer up  
He wanted to do the things he loved  
What once was Sunday fishin'  
Now was seven days a week  
He told his wife to find me  
I'll be down at the creek  
'Cause I don't want to drive another nail  
I've worked hard to do my job and I did it well  
I've got the scars on these two hands  
That show I haven't failed  
But I don't' want to drive another nail  
Now she was a woman full of faith  
And old Sam was full of pride  
And she knew that he had one more job  
To do before he died  
Easter Sunday rolled around  
In a country church for the lost and found  
Oh, Sam was there against his will  
As the preacher spoke on Calvary's Hill  
Of how they took the Master  
And they nailed Him to a tree  
And you could hear old Sam a cryin'  
As he fell down on his knees  
I don't wanna drive another nail  
I want to live my life for You, I want to do it well  
You've got the scars on Your two hands  
That show where I have failed  
Lord, I don't want to drive another nail  
I don't wanna drive another nail  
I want to live my life for You, I want to do it well  
You've got the scars on Your two hands  
That show where I have failed  
Lord, I don't want to drive another nail

Randy Travis,Easy To Love You,/r/randy+travis/easy+to+love+you_20114207.html,"You were pure to me as fresh untraveled snow  
Skin as soft as a petal, of an uncut rose  
I gave you all I had everything I own  
Right down to the pedestal, I put you on  
And it was so easy to love you  
So hard to walk away  
Well this morning when I woke up  
I knew everything had changed  
But it ain't so simple for a man  
Whose whole world he has to rearrange  
  
[Chorus]  
Said you found something in another  
You just couldn't find in me  
Baby I love you so much  
But I guess I'll have to set you free  
And it was so easy to love you  
So hard to walk away  
I've been pleading with my maker  
To ease this pain and take my pride  
But it still feels like my hearts been  
Laid open wide  
My hands are shaking and I think  
Of all I have to do  
My life will never be the same  
Not like it was with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord it was so easy to love you  
so hard to walk away

Randy Travis,Everything That I Own (Has Got A Dent),/r/randy+travis/everything+that+i+own+has+got+a+dent_20835412.html,"I'll drive around with the trunk tied down  
With a bungee cord  
Because I hoped a curb and backed into her  
New boyfriends Ford  
  
And down the hall  
There's a hole in the wall that's hard to miss  
It's about the size and shape of  
my right busted fist  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything I own has got a dent  
It's cracked or scratched or rip or torn  
Banged up or slightly bent  
Why should my heart be any different  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
  
She used to say I'm a man that's way to hard on stuff  
She let me know, that, that also goes for our love  
I guess her hearts like that old dead gold fish that I forgot to feed  
And mind like that dirt bike that I wrapped around that tree  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Inside, hole in the back  
Big piece of junk, ready for the trash  
Better days gone  
Heart just keeps on beating anyways  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't find one thing that don't  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
Big old dent

Randy Travis,Farther Along,/r/randy+travis/farther+along_20200409.html,"Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder  
Why it should take us all the day long  
While there are others living about us  
Never molested though in the wrong  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by  
  
When we see Jesus coming in glory  
When He comes down from His home in the sky  
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion  
We'll understand it all by and by  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine  
And we'll understand it all by and by  
We'll understand it all by and by
