And you think here at home is where I ought to be  
There's gonna be some changes made when you get in tonight  
Cause I'm gonna teach you wrong from right  
With my big iron skillet in my hand  
Gonna show you how a little woman quits a great big man  
If you live through the fight we're gonna have when you get home  
You'll wake up and find yourself alone

You say you're sick and tired of me and that I look a mess  
But it's never done on you this is my only dress  
I have never met a man who's quite the likes of you  
I don't know why I ever said I do  
With my big iron skillet...

But my days are darker than your nights  
My days are darker than your nights I wait for mornings that never arise  
There's just no end as long as I'm alive my days are darker than your nights  
  
You'll never know just what I'm going through  
I hope you'll never need someone like I need you  
You're happy now you've got just what you want

That's all I'm asking from you.

To do everyday what I have to do.  
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus  
And tomorrow may never be mine.  
Lord help me today, show me the way  
One day at a time.

Well Jesus you know if you're looking below  
It's worse now, than then.  
Cheating and stealing, violence and crime  
So for my sake, teach me to take  
One day at a time.

Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance, I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another and we'd say  
Those were the days my friend, we thought they'd never end  
  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we chose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la lay  
  
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days  
Just tonight, I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Oh was that lonely woman really me  
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh my friend we're older, but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
  
I've been lying in a bed of shame  
I've been dying all alone  
I pray for the power  
To turn it around

We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven  
They say ""Everything's all right""  
They say ""Better days are near""  
They tell us ""These are the good times""  
But they don't live around here  
Billy and Christie don't--  
Bruce and Patti don't--  
They don't live around here  
I had a girl  
Now she's gone  
She left town  
Town burned down  
Nothing left  
But the sound  
Of the front door closing forever  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven

It's the long arm of the law  
It's the long arm, it's the strong arm

Back in nineteen ninety-nine  
I was laying low in Lima  
Working both sides of the borderline  
  
It's the long arm, it's the strong arm  
It's the long arm of the law  
  
You can run, but you can't hide  
  
Well, I have to live like a fugitive  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Someone's coming after me  
And I'm running, running, yeah  
  
Now, don't protest your innocence  
Only the dead get off scott free  
And when the judge says, ""Whodunit?""  
You'll be crying, ""Not me! Not me!""

Maybe you went and helped yourself

in a ball, put them in the ground  
Tell my children only truths  
teach them to be proud  
Tell them dreams and miracles  
when thy thunder stops  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
I was born a travelling trooper  
but I laid my wings to rest  
Once I beat myself in squallor  
now I feather up my nest  
There are flags in my back yard  
colours on my wall  
I pay my servant well  
but I made the bastard crawl  
that I don't hear that thunder start  
Bury my heart!  
There's a lily in the valley  
where I brought the news to Ro  
I offered him my visions but  
the heathen rose to go  
So I took my shining sabre and I slew  
my sinning friend  
A christian burial was all he needed  
to make him whole again  
And I looked up way above me  
and God rent the sky apart  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
We're God's chosen people  
this and other truths I know  
Put them into vicious practice  
because the bible tells me so  
And I drowned the noble savage  
in the blessed holy water  
I burned his filthy village  
and I civilized his daughter  
The liars in this world  
who say we shame the blood of Christ  
But killing is his mercy  
and nits grow into lice  
And all those gooks I napalmed  
man, I did it in God's name  
When the fools put me on trial I shouted out  
I'm not to blame -- I did it for him!  
I did it for him!  
I did it for him!  
He made do it!  
He tore the heavens apart  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Now I'm going to wilderness  
on a horse that I can trust  
I will die where I fall  
in the hot dry dust  
And if you come to that place  
remember this truth  
That he who's born to property  
is he who's born to lose  
Will you bury my soul  
where the dust meets the sea  
Will you bury my heart  
at Wounded Knee!  
Bury my heart  
at Wounded Knee!  
Bury my heart

But only if he rides the road with you""  
I stepped aboard a ship that flew  
It took me to wherever it wanted to  
Far above the land, far above the sea  
The dreamer and the doer agreed to agree  
I was sent to the war, stripped of my power  
Gagged and imprisoned in a tall dark tower  
I must have cried for an age or more  
'till I saw through tears and I found the door  
High on a cliff, in gorgeous clothes  
A madman danced on the balls of his toes  
Forgetting myself I fell at the feet  
Of the greatest Fool I ever did meet  
The stars were bright and magic afoot  
On the Summer wind rose the sound of a flute  
I saw the musician - my heart knew him well  
What happens next, no rhyme can tell  
We came to the end of the world one day  
A dolphin swan in a sheltered bay  
I paid to the King what it was I owed,  
Put my face to the wind and my foot on the road  
I find I've wandered far from home  
But home is in me wherever I roam  
I thought I was an hour or a year behind

Changed my sacks for a uniform  
Bit my lip against the snow

Raised the red flag high  
Burnt the reichstag brown

Waterboys,The Wayward Wind,/w/waterboys/the+wayward+wind_20145309.html,"In a lonesome shack by the railroad track  
I spent my younger days  
And I guess the sound of the outward bound  
Made me a slave  
To my wandering queen  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
I met her down in a border town  
we swore we'd never part  
Though I tried my best to settle down  
now she's all alone  
With a broken heart  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
the next of kin  
The next of kin

Waterboys,We Are Jonah,/w/waterboys/we+are+jonah_20145448.html,"And the well known fox  
Stepped up to make his speech  
His ship was on the rocks  
And rescue out of reach  
Spotlit he stood  
Said what he thought he should  
  
Half the crowd did laugh  
Though there was no joke  
And soon the other half  
Were swallowed up in smoke  
A robber on the wing  
Could be heard to sing  
The strangest thing  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
Then the plane did land  
For some it did not crash  
  
From it emerged a man  
In trainers and mustache  
Down he laid his load  
Upon the hated road  
Then the road did part  
And the tar did melt  
He loosened up his heart  
He tightened up his belt  
Like a piece of string  
Then he began to sing  
Like a pearly king !  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
Then the scene did shift  
To a sun kissed sea  
There was Montgomery Clift,  
  
Jonah, the whale and me  
As the sun it set  
Montgomery placed his bet  
Then the whale did yawn  
And fell asleep in four  
From dusk till dawn  
You should have heard him snore  
From Tierra Del Fuego  
To the Alaskan snows  
There she blows  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
My dear old Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale!

This morning everything seemed okay  
Till I let my pet snake get loose in the kitchen  
Now I've been in trouble all day.  
  
I got some paint on the wall a pretty orange color  
And a little on the carpet and floor  
I covered it up with mom's coat from the closet  
That she says she can't wear anymore.  
  
I've had a bad, bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
I've had a bad, bad day  
It seems like everyone's picking on me.  
  
I put some sand in my grandpa's tobacco  
And he frowned at me all day  
Then I hid his pipe 'cause it smells when he smokes it  
He shouldn't smoke anyway.  
  
So between mom's coat and my grandpa's tobacco  
Life can be rough on a kid  
They've almost worn out the seat of my britches  
It don't hurt much now, but it did.

She said that she'd be back in no time at all here I sit drivin' nails in the

In the dark that stacks around me dreams of you keep pounding me  
Leading me to where I've never been  
And the voice keeps telling me this could be insanity but I know my name as
well as you  
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall...  
In the wilted patterns of my mind find that I've left you behind  
Sowing up my torn memories  
Surviving living three bed room electric kitchen and living room  
Just burning and it's on a new free way  
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hall  
She said that she'd be back in no time at all  
When she is back I'm gonna nail to the wall

Rub my neck and just write 'em a check and they'll be on their way

I played all kinds of places played all kinds of girls  
I don't remember faces I don't remember names  
What the hell it's just as well cause after a while and a thousand miles  
It all becomes the same  
I am the entertainer I come to do my show  
You heard my latest record spin on the radio  
Well it took me years to write it the best years of my life  
It's a beautiful song but it ran too long wanna have a hit you gotta make it
fit  
So they cut it down to 3:05  
I am the entertainer Idol of my age  
Make all kinds of money boy when I go on the stage  
They see me in the paper and in the magazines  
If I go cold my feet get sore put me in the back of the discount rack

Hola, my good friend  
Cinco de Mayo's on Tuesday  
And I hoped we'd see each other again  
You killed my brother last winter  
You shot him three times in the back  
In the night I still hear mama weeping  
Oh mama, still dresses in black  
I looked at every fiesta  
For you I wanted to greet  
Maybe I'd sell you a chicken  
With poison interlaced with the meat  
You, you look like my brother  
Mama loved him the best  
He was head honcho with the ladies  
Mama always said he was blessed  
The village all gathered around him  
They couldn't believe what they saw  
I said it was you that had killed him  
And that I'd find you and upstand the law  
The people of the village believed me  
Mama, she wanted revenge  
I told her that I'd see that she was honored  
I'd find you and put you to death  
  
So now, now that I've found you  
On this such a joyous day  
I tell you it was me who killed him  
But the truth I'll never have to say

There shall be rest in a while, daylight has come  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
  
Who can explain all these thoughts racking my mind  
An endless barrage of shit racking my mind  
The eel offered his help I can't understand  
Speaking it's truth from the bank now I can see  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel

And I thought it'd be good for you and me to check in  
I met with the gal from Expo  
And they do have the ""slab"" cabinets in white  
She thinks we can take the measurements  
Down at the site  
If we do that, we'll be just fine, Miss Sweeney  
That's all I got to say to you at this time, Miss Sweeney  
Actually there's one other thing on my mind  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
  
I'm so sorry Miss Sweeney  
I don't know where that came from  
I think I was overcome by spontaneous emotion  
Anyway, the cash deposit of five thousand will need to be sent to the property
owner tomorrow  
If there are any problems with the deposit or contract  
Don't be afraid to holler  
I don't want to have a approve each stinking dollar  
That we borrow  
Aww forget it, Miss Sweeney  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
  
Miss Sweeney, I got to admit the truth  
I am totally head over heels in love with you  
Every day you come to the office looking fine  
Navy business suit clinging tightly to your spine  
You ask me if I'm ready to get down to work  
Sweeney, baby, I'm ready...be my...  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
Girl, you light the skies of my life  
I swear I will make you my wife  
I'm waiting until you love me

Now it's getting unbelievable.

Momma would scold us if we got too rough  
She didn't care, she was proud of us  
I ran around and talked to the animals  
Tellin' 'em stories of savage cannibals  
  
Then I got older and noticed a girl  
At first I was sure I didn't exist to her  
I sulker around but I didn't know why  
Then she put her cheek on my shoulder and I  
Was lookin' at her and she was lookin' at me  
We started to smile it was our destiny  
Tina was her name. She was my cutie-pie  
I forgot about things that I used to like  
  
I spent all my time followin' her around  
My friends all made the whip-lash sound  
But they understood. They was happy for me  
And everyone clapped when I asked her to marry me  
And she said ""yes"" and we felt so fine  
We lost track of the passin' time  
Before I knew it we had our own babies:  
Gina and Shannon and Keebie and Gabe  
  
But now I've got to die  
I've lived a good life I've got no complaints  
I'd like to thank Farmer Pete  
For bringing me scraps of food that I could eat  
He always had a smile on his face  
He didn't want to think of this day  
It's finally here

I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat  
And my homies agree  
I really look good in black fool  
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears  
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years  
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare  
We're just technologically impaired  
  
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar  
Not a single luxury  
Like Robinson Caruso  
It's as primitive as can be  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We're just plain and simple guys  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
There's no time for sin and vice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We don't fight, we all play nice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
  
Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter  
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anutter  
Think you're really righteous?  
Think you're pure in heart?  
Well, I know I'm a million time as humble as thou art  
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like  
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife  
So don't be vain and don't be whiny  
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We're all crazy Mennonites  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
There's no cops or traffic lights  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
But you'd probably think it bites  
Living in an Amish Paradise

Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?  
Could it be Bill or Jim or Ed or Bernie or Steve?""  
I probably would have kept on guessing  
But about that time we crashed into the truck

And they took some Polaroids and said I was a darn good sport  
And as a way of saying thank you  
They offered to transport me back to any point in history that I would care to
go  
And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night  
So I could pay my phone bill on time

When I got a nasty paper cut

And it's obvious he doesn't like the Nehru jacket that I'm wearing

year's supply of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all. You
also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people. You

Well, he always was the neighborhood clown  
Like the time he pulled my pants off  
And he took those color pictures  
  
And posted copies all over town  
Or the time that he dumped toxic waste on my lawn  
Or those wacky prank phone calls from midnight till dawn  
What a crazy kid Larry was, always foolin' around  
  
Boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
Say, do you remember when I lost all my hair  
'Cause Lar' gave me that Nair shampoo  
And hey, how 'bout the day he put Ben Gay inside my jockstrap  
And filled my toothpaste tube up glue  
All those wedgies he gave  
All those shoestrings he tied  
All those brownies he made with the Ex-Lax inside  
Oh, Lar', I swear, it was a laugh a minute with you  
  
Boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
You know I couldn't help but laugh  
Even though he treated me like slime  
Remember when he cut my car in half?  
Well, he really got me good that time!  
  
Say, do you remember when I broke in Larry's house  
Late at night and tied his mouth with a rag  
Then I dragged him by his ankles to the middle of the forest  
And stuffed him in a big plastic bag  
  
If the cops ever find him, who knows what they'd say  
But I'm sure if ol' Lar' were still with us today  
He would have to agree with me  
It was a pretty good gag

Weird Al Yankovic,Jerry Springer,/w/weird+al+yankovic/jerry+springer_20145773.html,"It's been one week since we got to see  
Cheatin' lovers and cousins that marry  
Five days since they had the show  
With the hermaphrodite, the slut and the crack ho  
Three days since we heard the tale  
About the guy who learned his woman was a she-male  
Yesterday it occurred to me  
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer  
  
Holy cow, d'you see it last week?  
Well, they had this one freak  
Who sucker-punched his whole family  
Do you recall when the brawl  
Became a total free-for-all?  
And Jerry's in the middle tryin' to be the referee  
Hey, see the stripper with the implants?  
She likes to lap dance  
And date the boyfriend of her mother  
Now here comes Jerry's next guest  
And it's a slugfest  
Cause it's her trailer trash brother  
Nymphomaniac is back on crack  
It's like ""When Animals Attack""  
They all exhibit reprehensible behavior  
Hit 'em in the nose, tear off their clothes  
Step on their toes, that's how it goes  
They get so violent they have to sign a waiver  
  
They're always swearin', cursin', kickin' butt and pointin' blame  
On the air? They don't care, they've got no shame  
There was one guy who I'm sure felt a little strange  
When he found out that his wife had a sex change  
They have a tendency to scream and yell constantly  
They have a history of ripping off their shirts  
  
It's been one week since they had the fight  
With the Siamese twins and the transvestite  
Five days since that awful brawl  
They still haven't got the blood off the wall  
It's been three days since the bitter feud  
Between the KKK and that gay Jewish black dude  
Yesterday, finally dawned on me  
I'm spendin' way too much time on that Jerry Springer  
  
Baby, I've been sleepin' with your sister.  
Oh, which one?  
All of 'em.  
Ah, well, I've been sleepin' with your best friend Jake.  
Yeah? W-Well, me too! And, I've been sleepin' with your dog Woofie!  
Woofie, you bitch! Well I'm also sleepin' with your pet goat!  
That goat doesn't love you!  
  
Once you start watchin', there's just no stoppin'  
Your brain shuts down, then your IQ's droppin'  
Jerry's the king of confrontation  
He's a sensation  
He puts the 'sin' in syndication  
It's totally worthless, like a bad check  
It's like a train wreck  
Don't want to stare, but you can't look away  
Like Sally Jesse he does talk shows  
But with more weirdos  
The ratings jumpin' higher every day  
If you've seen the show, well then you know  
It's just as low as you can go  
The guests are tacky and they're lacking in their hygiene  
And pretty soon some ugly goon  
Comes in the room and then it's BOOM  
In the face of some unsuspecting drag queen  
  
Well, it's the kind of show where people scream obscenities  
Yankin' hair, throwin' chairs at their hubbies  
""Jerry! Jerry!"" Now the crowd starts their favorite chant  
Should I turn off my TV? I just can't  
I have a tendency to watch it religiously  
I have a history of taping each one  
  
It's been one week since the show about  
Psycho killers with problems they should work out  
Five days since the big surprise  
When some loser's wife said that she's still dating twenty guys  
Three days since he interviewed  
A bunch of psychic porn star midgets who were all nude  
Yesterday, it occurred to me  
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer  
Tired of wastin' my time on that Jerry Springer  
I've got way too much class to watch Jerry Springer  
Come over here and pull on my finger

Inside a blender and turned it on  
You know, I've been in a butt load of pain

I couldn't feel any worse if you dropped  
A two-ton bowling ball on my toes

It couldn't hurt anymore if you shoved  
A red-hot cactus up my nose

Doctor, listen to me, tell me what this means  
First I'm goin' shoppin' in my underwear  
Then all of sudden I'm floating in mid air  
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare  
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere  
  
Now Doctor, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet  
Next comes the part that I won't ever forget  
Now I'm bein' followed by these Russian spies  
They give me some velcro, and an order of fries  
Suddenly I'm bowling on the Starship Enterprise  
I fall down a hole and that's when I realize  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
All right!  
  
Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane  
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain  
See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur  
Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor  
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door  
And I'm back in the very same place I was before  
  
Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White

Night after night after night after night  
  
And I can't bust out and I can't break free  
And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me  
And I can't go home and I can't get loose  
And I try to escape but it's just no use  
  
And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win  
And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in  
And I can't go back and I can't get through  
But Vanna since you're here, why don't you let me buy a vowel from you  
  
Come on Vanna, come on!  
  
Ow, buhhh  
  
Doctor, all those crazy dreams have started again  
That's right, I even wake up screaming now and then  
See, I'm coming home from work but I forgot my address  
I'm half an hour late for my algebra test

You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up  
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine.  
  
A'took the foot bridge, way 'cross the water  
Though she weighed two-ninety nine.  
The old bridge trembled and disassembled  
(Oops!) dumped her into the foamy brine.  
  
Hey, crackle like thunder, (ho, ho) she went under  
(ho, ho) blowin bubbles (bubble sound) down the line.  
Hey, I'm no swimm'a but were she slimm'a  
I might'a saved that Clementine.

I thought that she was doin' fine.  
I wasn't nervous ya until the service  
That they held for Clementine.  
  
Hey you sailor (ho, ho) way out in your whaler  
With a harpoon, your trusty line.  
If she shows now, yo, there she blows now,  
It just may be chunky Clementine.

When everything was going right

Another winter day, has come and gone away  
In either Paris and Rome  
And I wanna go home

Let me go home  
I've had my run  
Baby I'm done

You take my hand, and it fees like home,  
We both understand, it where we belong  
So do I say, do I say goodbye,  
We both have our dreams we both want to fly,  
So lets take tonight, to carry us through the lonely times

Memories will last for eternity  
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain  
As I found my way back to your arms again

The Queen of my heart  
  
So lets take tonight, and never let go  
While we dance we kiss, like there's no tomorrow,  
As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring,  
I'll treasure this moment, till we meet again  
  
But no matter how far, away you may be ,  
I'll just close my eyes, and your in my dreams,  
And there you will be, until we will meet.

Say good-bye and say hello  
Sure 'nough good to see you  
But it's time to go  
Don't say yes, but please  
Don't say no  
I don't want to be lonely tonight  
  
Go away then, damn you  
Go on and do as you please  
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees  
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided  
You've been turning my world upside down  
  
Do me wrong, do me right  
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight  
Save your good-byes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight

I can feel  
The road that you're travelling  
Takes you so far away  
Sometimes it won't hurt you  
And there'll be times when you cry  
As long as you're with me  
I will be strong  
The bridge I have to cross  
I've burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
It feels like I'm walking, walking, walking  
Walking on water with you by my side  
Yes I'm walking on water and I know you're by my side  
There's a place I wanna get to  
Where I'm as free as a bird  
Where all my prayers will be answered  
And the truth is your to hold  
And the bridge I have to cross  
I've burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
Feels like I'm walking, walking, walking  
Walking on water with you by my side

That the bridge I have to cross  
I've burned so many times before  
But with you by my side  
It still feels like I'm walking, walking  
Walking on water with you by my side  
And I'm walking on water and you're still by my side  
And I'm walking on water and I got so much tears in my life  
And I'm walking, walking, walking on water  
And you're here by my side  
Walking on water and I'm so full with pride  
Walking on water and I ain't got no tears in my eye  
You by my side.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand  
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out  
All you did was wreck my bed  
And, in the morning, kick me in the head  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
'Cause you didn't want to be alone  
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool  
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

You think that I care  
About me and only me

Climbing up a tree  
Well I know it don't take much  
To satisfy me  
  
Maybe it's whatever's in my head

To stimulate devotion  
Well then you'd see  
  
Well I'm finding it hard to say

And tell us which one is sane

Throw my jacket in the mud for you

Blues siting on my shoulder,  
Getting heavier every day  
  
Staring into space,  
One thing on my mind,  
I've been trying to drown  
The thought of you  
By drinking too much wine  
  
Then my imagination  
Starts running wild,  
I snap my fingers  
And you're there by my side

Ain't no reason, ain't no rhyme,  
Without your love  
I'll go out of my mind  
  
Been getting too lazy,  
Letting myself go,  
Feeling like a refugee  
No one cares for anymore  
Endless lonely days,  
I just try to get through,  
And there's no escape,  
Even when I sleep,  
'Cause all I dream is you  
  
Then my imagination  
Gets the better of me,  
'Cause you're everywhere I go,  
In everything I see

There's no song without your love  
There ain't no reason, there ain't no rhyme,

You make me sing,

From the howling storm

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.  
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?  
  
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,  
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,  
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,  
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:  
'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  
  
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore  
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,  
A home and a country should leave us no more!  
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.  
No refuge could save the hireling and slave  
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  
  
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand  
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!  
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land  
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.  
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust.""  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

An ear to confide

Your deepest of feelings inside

Was just platonic between us

Turn serious lovers

Some nights I still sleep on the beach  
Remember when stars were in reach  
Then I wander in early to work  
Spend the day licking boots for my perks  
  
A beach is a place where a man can feel, etc  
  
People often change  
But when I look in your eyes  
You could learn a lot from  
A job like mine  
The secret to me  
Isn't flown like a flag  
I carry it behind  
This little badge  
What says...  
  
Bell Boy!

Who,"Blue, Red And Grey",/w/who/blue+red+grey_20146584.html,"Some people seem so obsessed with the morning  
Get up early just to see the sun rise  
Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky  
Worship the sun when it's high  
Some people go for those sultry evenings  
Sipping cocktails in the blue, red and grey  
  
But I like every minute of the day  
  
I like every second, so long as you are on my mind  
Every moment has its special charm  
It's alright when you're around, rain or shine  
  
I know a crowd who only live after midnight  
Their faces always seem so pale  
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight  
They say a suntan never fails  
I know a man who works the night shift  
He's lucky to get a job and some pay  
  
And I like every minute of the day  
  
I dig every second  
I can laugh in the snow and rain  
I get a buzz from being cold and wet  
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain  
  
And so you see that I'm completely crazy  
I even shun the south of France  
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy  
But when they sleep, I sing and dance  
Some people have to have the sutlry evenings  
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey  
  
But I like every minute of the day

Waking up on Christmas morning  
Hours before the winter sun's ignited.

Including heaven's generosity.  
Peeping round the door  
To see what parcels are for free  
In curiosity.

He doesn't know who Jesus was  
Or what praying is.  
How can he be saved  
From the eternal grave?  
  
Surrounded by his friends  
He sits so silently  
And unaware of everything.  
Playing poxy pinball,  
Picks his nose and smiles and  
Pokes his tongue at everything.  
I believe in love  
But how can men who've never seen  
Light be enlightened.  
Only if he's cured  
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

Sticks and stones may break your bones  
But names can never down you

My head is in a cloud  
I ain't quiet - everybody else is too loud

It's going down and it's blazing hot  
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints  
You just got to get the amps from Boogie  
Get the van from Rock and then  
Call up Ishcabibble's, Jim's and Pat's  
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats  
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sending 'em back  
And get my mic right  
If I get hyped, I might rap  
Then take the speakers find a good spot  
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top  
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner  
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib  
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block  
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top  
You want to come, you got to come on your feet  
Ain't nothing like having a party  
When it's out in the street, come on

Nine o'clock I'ma call my crew  
And ten o'clock we gonna roll on through

When everybody know everybody on the block  
And everybody on the block  
Come to the party on the block  
And when the sun drop, (we don't stop)  
Funny how fast they travel the word  
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard  
That it's a block party down in West Philly  
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy  
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap  
Jeff got it, jam packed  
Everybody, hands in the air  
(Just get your hands in the air!)  
Yo Philly! (that's where the party's at!)  
D.C. why y'all! (that's where the party's at!)  
A-T-L (that's where the party's at!)  
West side! (that's where the party's at!)  
Mid-west why yall (that's where the party's at!)  
Dirty South now (that's where the party's at!)

Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop  
All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on  
All day long I been plotting on this nice john  
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is trying to hype me  
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?  
Hear the crowd cheer, brought a little smile out  
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out  
I know he's old, but  
Maybe it's a slight chance  
I could get my brother hype  
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not  
Lemme get the crowd jumping  
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something  
I'm like Rob Base- I want to rock right now  
why yall know who run the block right now  
All we need is a mic and a beat  
And a couple of speakers  
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!

Will Smith,Summertime,/w/will+smith/summertime_20146987.html,"Summer, summer, summertime  
Time to sit back and unwind  
  
Here it is the groove slightly transformed  
Just a bit of a break from the norm  
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony  
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be  
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance  
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance  
Give me a soft subtle mix  
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it  
And think of the summers of the past  
Adjust the bass and let the alpine blast  
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme  
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime  
  
Chorus  
  
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz  
But back then I didn't really know what it was  
But now I see what happened is  
The way that people respond to summer madness  
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less  
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best  
Riding around in your jeep or your Benzos  
Or in your Nissan sitting on lorenzos  
Back in Philly we'd be out in the park  
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes  
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise  
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes  
She turns around to see what you beeping at  
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac  
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme  
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time  
  
Chorus  
  
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet  
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set  
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair  
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there  
The temperature's about 88  
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake  
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more  
Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4  
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise  
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss  
And as I think back makes me wonder how  
The smell from a girl could spark up nostalgia  
All the kids playing out front  
Little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch  
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family  
Reunion  
Then six o'clock rolls around  
You just finished wiping your car down  
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout  
It looks like a car show  
Everybody come lookin real fine  
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon  
Every moment frontin' and maxin'  
Chillin in the car they spent all day waxin'  
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through  
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you  
There's an air of love and of happiness  
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness  
  
Chorus

I really wish I could explain it baby  
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby  
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby  
Don't cry, dry your eyes  
  
[Will Smith]  
September 11th I woke up about 7 AM  
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon  
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on  
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw  
Me and my children, images were chillin'  
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?  
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest  
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him  
That night at my son's side, he cried  
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade  
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God  
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why  
Then one week later our bombs were dropped  
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop  
The infrared, images of brutal attack  
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Souls are captured (souls are captured)  
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)  
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)  
Evil plaguin' he rewardin'  
Hate surrender (hate surrender)  
Love exalted! (Love exalted!)  
Hope elated! (hope elated!)  
Negativity destroyed and..  
  
[Will Smith]  
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word  
and why, did her uncles have to molest her  
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?  
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?  
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?  
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us  
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot  
And why, is human life always denied for loot?  
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage  
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age  
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate  
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?  
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?  
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?  
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?  
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Will Smith]  
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy  
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby  
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy  
You live four scores and still it be drivin' you crazy  
But for me I try to see the button side  
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin' to hide  
or tryin' to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside  
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God

Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate

And, if for one time in my life,  
I'm acting like a man,  
I guess you'll have to blame it on the times.  
  
Blame it on the many times,  
A hiding place I'd seek.  
Afraid to say what's on my mind,  
An' ashamed for being weak.  
So if at last I'm seeing,  
After so long being blind,  
I suppose you'll have to blame it on the times.

The summer sun was sinkin' low  
There's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glance  
And the native hearts are all a-glow  
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene  
They all stare like a statue out of stone  
And when they realize what's before their eyes  
The other girls are left all alone.  
  
Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'  
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm  
But from miles away you can see her sway  
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.  
  
Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky  
Sits a wide-eyed monkey on a limb  
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble  
Just to try to be like him  
He doesn't understand, that it's a lady's hand  
That makes a heart feel so sublime  
But before too long, he starts singing the song  
And then he gets in the Conga line.  
  
Columbus searched for spices, but he missed the nicest  
Part of the Caribbean  
He didn't see the charms and the open arms  
It was the gold that he was seein'  
Oh, but I'm glad he missed, the sweetest thing I've kissed  
'Cause we're on our honeymoon  
I'm so sorry Chris, to talk about you like this  
But you were five-hundred years too soon.

If I only had one leg to stand on  
Then how much how much truer picture you'd see  
'Cause then I more closely resemble  
The half a man that you've made of me

They only told me we were parting  
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me

How could I help if tears were starting?  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea  
I longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whispering  
Some other harbor lights  
Will steal your love from me

You said the ice would kill  
But you would not be caught

We breathe as one together and shed our tears  
But then I woke with you  
And my dream came true

Wishbone Ash,A Thousand Years,/w/wishbone+ash/a+thousand+years_20147171.html,"Times are changing, we'll soon be facing  
A story yet unknown.  
Don't deny it, we can't defy it.  
It'll happen on it's own.  
The past behind us, there to remind us  
Of what could be again.  
Fact or fiction, deep intuition  
Of wondering how and when.  
Once in a thousand years  
The secrets of the past  
Will change the way we see.  
Across the ocean, the world's emotions  
Are in and out of time.  
The changing seasons, no rhyme or reason,  
The choices, cruel or kind.  
One day it's clear, then clouds appear  
'cause nothing stays the same.  
The thoughts that have conditioned you,  
It's how you play the game.  
But then the day will come around  
We'll turn the world upside down.

We're fighting our fear of the silence  
We're running through walls where they stand

But that don't mean we can't get rich  
Too rich (too rich)  
That's what they say  
  
[Verse 1]  
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings  
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies  
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'  
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'  
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker  
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper  
What can I say now, cops know my name now  
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now  
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds  
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now  
Try not to fade now, try to find a way out  
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down  
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out  
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house  
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about  
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about  
  
[Hook]  
Try to be the best that I can  
They got the right decisions, handle it like a man  
You know I try to do shit with my heart  
They talk but I don't listen  
I just finish what I start  
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't  
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same  
  
[Verse 2]  
Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting  
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases  
But never said I'd stop counting these faces  
Flyin' new places, buying them cases  
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it  
Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment  
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter  
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us  
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer  
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor  
Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures  
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures  
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender  
Big winner in the club, big cash spender  
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher  
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business

I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night  
Girl, take pride in what you wanna do  
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you  
Baby, I don't mind  
You can tell by how I roll  
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold  
My tongue slurred cause I'm so throwed  
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show  
And he's TG and I'm XO  
I'm only here for one night  
And I'mma be your memory  
Sing it in my ears, so I can hear what you're saying to me  
I got cups full of that Rose  
Smoke anything that's passed to me  
Don't worry 'bout my boys  
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you  
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you  
I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me  
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you  
I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you  
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory  
Make me remember you like you remember me

Lightyears past the class  
Hit it, don't have to pass

Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh  
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash  
You's a fan of a player  
I'm the man, you's a hater  
And I only smoke papers  
That's how you tell them Taylors  
Nigga listen  
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen  
And not a thing comes out without permission  
Look, everything I got on I was made for  
Everything that I got I done came for  
All the shit that you see I done slaved for  
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for  
Need I say more  
Spend so much money on clothes  
Said fuck a store, making my own  
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along  
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song  
Pour out some shots  
You're taking too long  
Young and I'm rich  
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

Good to you

I'm on some gin, you on some gin  
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast  
I hit the weed, you take the wheel  
We lose control  
Drop the top in that 69  
Not Motor 1, not old Chevelle  
Can't say things like supposed to feel  
Stacking all of this paper, dawg  
I like to call this shit old news  
It means haters jocking our old moves  
Popping champagne cause we made it  
Pack in the Phantom, we faded  
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks  
Witness, forget his, original statement  
Even in protection programs there's no escapement  
Gunned down, we in town, hit king from seven crowns  
Spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge  
Wounded, back in the eighty-three summer heat  
Up in three-oh-nine park, rhymin' off the drummer's beat  
I stalk the city streets demonstratin' mic wrecks  
All lookin' stank, I ain't playin wit a full deck  
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared  
They saw the coming of Wu, the neon in Times Square  
Household name, assassin, killa bee  
Mill to the grain, that possess the Wu, trilogy  
Quick to spot those that bite camouflage and blend  
Those that got styles, they got identical twins  
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finnicky  
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry  
But I go line for line on the whole page

Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily  
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly  
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions  
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition  
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual  
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals  
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural  
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural  
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment  
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments  
Just consider the unparallel advantage  
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with

The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth

Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette  
Or with the mask on, peelin' the tech  
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep  
Annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette  
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids  
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip  
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips  
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips  
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick  
She like, this your pussy, and she smash my click  
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall  
Niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board  
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law  
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'  
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war  
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more  
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating  
So without reason, pounds are squeezing  
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM  
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine  
For a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans  
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams  
  
[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles (RZA)]  
If real niggaz is listening, the life we living in, is wrong  
(Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable, Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable)  
Back for transitions, to save us from harm  
We in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind  
But if we run the race like a thug  
We would lose that mind that we made of

You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill  
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heal  
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand  
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand  
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this  
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed  
One man, can't uplift the land  
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans  
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant  
Splendid, unprecidented, hip hop vintage  
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us  
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizzes

If you don't have a Jeep, and you have a little hooptie I still want  
you to crank up your volume.  
We want all the ladies to sit back, relax, let your hair out.  
Wyclef presents the Neville Brothers in the house tonight.  
  
I know a girl, she ruled my world.  
Whatever I need, she supplied.  
Living in paradise.  
She ruled my heart, till death do we part.

At least that's how I thought it would be.  
(So Neville brothers what you telling me)  
At least that how I thought it would be  
(One question, what was her name)  
Mona Lisa, you called my name.  
Laid it apart but I did not respond  
And you ask me what I am thinking of  
In the morning I'll be gone, no more loving after dawn.  
No longer we can share the love that was never there.  
When the moon has lost its light.  
And the stars no longer bright  
And no longer can we share, the love that was never there.  
(Ain't no need to cry girl. Its gonna be alright)  
  
Girl don't you cry.

Please dry your eyes  
All you ever been was faithful in my life.  
So I apologize

Rebel music, everywhere put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, hold on, listen  
  
Tell the DJ turn the music up  
Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs  
Me I play the walk, sipping on the Guinness  
Cause in reality we are the same and it's  
Just society they want to see me  
Flesh on the concrete, sold a perfect story  
The mystery is waking up in misery  
The music industry brainwash celebrities  
Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with a monster  
Have no idea that their face was a piranha  
Word from the wise I can see through the fog  
Reason why they rob cause they got no job  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
When they see me they ask me  
Will there ever be another Fugees  
I say I don't know but hope the trio  
Don't do like ? ? then ? on Sadaam though  
But on CNN they saw the same  
Little kids getting shot at close range  
To Babylon, we don't want no war  
I'm a send a message in a bottle to the White House, Lord  
These are the words from the master  
So don't you wait till the day after  
Until then you can catch me in the sixes  
Just pumping Bob Marley rebel music now

Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
Children, imagine a world with no racism  
No, no homeless in Grand Central Station  
Boys and girls going to schools with no tools  
Life is so beautiful but until then it will be  
Rebel music, rebel music  
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now  
  
Uh, can these devils fool us son, not now ? done  
We're a generation of thugs, you can't play with us  
We've been lied to, enslaved and beaten up  
We're immune to what you call pain, it's nothing  
We're not scared of dying or afraid of guns  
Born in the USA, nah, can't blame us  
Our DNA's foreign to them  
We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will  
Yo, cash be my ?, it's about to get stupid  
These niggaz trying to stop our plans, peace to it  
I never meant to cause him pain and he knew it  
But he was trying to kill me and he blew it  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today

Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music  
Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today  
Preacher's son, yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot  
And they both still were rulers of hip hop  
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college  
And Big L never got found in the alley  
Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies  
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50  
Benzino shook hands with Eminem  
And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim  
And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up  
I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up  
And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray  
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!)  
  
[Chorus]  
Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop  
Cause what we say is what we see  
What we see is reality  
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow  
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow  
  
[Verse 2]  
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive  
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad  
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child  
And TLC never lost they Left Eye  
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport  
And John Forte never at Newark Airport  
Million Man March, man, that was a start  
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park  
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this  
Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported (Whoa oh oh!)

Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop

Soon they won't live to see tomorrow  
  
[Verse 3]  
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun  
But in the limosine JLO had to run  
Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror  
That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana  
Back and forth and forth and back  
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her  
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox  
Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top  
Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah  
While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die

Shots go off, mother's cry  
Death since rise, homicide  
Black on black crime needs to stop  
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop

Feel the flames  
For my loved ones to excel in this game  
Then let it burn  
Let it burn  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I pray to the Lord that my soul he keeps  
Nobody weeps when a G dies  
But like Maya Angelou still we rise  
Mama tried to keep me home at night  
But despite her attempts  
I hung with the macks and the pimps  
Sidin' with the Rip's  
Not 'cause I like blue if you like red  
I did it 'cause I never did like you  
And it said the good die young  
I don't recognize myself what have I become?  
Can you tell me why am I headed for a dead end?  
Why I got another dead friend?  
Why they surround me- dead men?  
Everywhere I look right and left  
Flip another page in the book of life and death  
It's comin'- I feel it breathin' down my back  
It got me runnin' Grim Reap ain't cuttin' no slack  
What can I do where can I go  
Lord forgive me for all I did 'cause I didn't know  
And when my heart beats it's last tick  
Somebody sat these three words in my casket:  
Lord have mercy  
[chorus]  
Lord forgive me for all the wrong that I did  
All of the pain that I inflicted as a kid  
On Judgement Day consider this before you curse me  
I was only a child so Lord have mercy  
Forgive me for all the wrong that I've done  
All of the pain I inflicted when I was young  
On Judgement Day consider this before you curse me  
I was only a child so Lord have mercy  
Should I die before I wake  
Don't shed a tear Mama 'cause I finally escaped  
No more drama no more blood sweat and tears  
No more pressure from my peers  
and no more fears  
I rest in peace- how long will it last  
Fore I have to answer for what I did in the past  
Illin' - willin' and dealin' cops always after me  
I call it survival and you call it misanthropy  
But let the record reflect circumstances were suspect  
But you couldn't care less- mann  
While I struggle to survive  
You turned your eyes- plugged your up ears  
Ignored my cries  
Now Ms. America sayin' we scarin' her  
But she can give me Liberty or Death- I'm darin' her  
Either one'll set me free- that's all I want to be  
But that ain't what y'all want to see  
You'd rather see me killin' up my own in the ghetto  
Or sellin' blow to anybody Black, Brown, or Yellow  
But forget that- I'm tryin' to get my head right  
Even if it mean I gotta get dead tonight  
Lord have mercy forgive me  
[chorus]  
Forgive me for the blood that his body bled  
And all the tears that his Mommy shed  
Book says 'Thou Shalt Not Kill'  
But I done seen more blood spilled  
Than the vets on Hamburger Hill- it's real  
Post War Syndrome- went to see my homie  
But his Mama told me that the homie been gone  
Everytime I turn around it be another body on the ground  
With fresh gunshot wounds but he didn't hear a sound  
When he came out the room  
Nobody told him he would be dead so soon  
But the gauge went boom Ms. America,  
I know you got a cure for AIDS  
But we need a cure for Raid who on a rampage  
Can you feel it- the tensions in the air thick  
Hate got me so high I'm gettin' airsick  
Got my people broke lookin for a buck to borrow  
Doin it one day at a time fuck your sorrow  
Fuck tomorrow I want revenge  
I got a Beretta named Vendetta  
Time to answer for your sin- man  
When you meet your creator- tell him I apologize  
But I gotta ride Lord have mercy forgive me...

Accept it, it's what I protected  
No excuse, nothin' else respected

May God Bless it

Produce a strap from my draws, introducin' slugs to the vagrants  
Statements was made so foul, niggas is funny style  
Tell a hundred niggas you hate me but when you see me you smile

But in your heart, you never really felt you could fade it  
Debate it, what I represent nigga, this G.B.C.

So hit the freeway, no lee-way 'cause this ain't your zip code

We'll light you up and disappear like we vaporous

Put bullet holes in your shorts

Deport your corpse in where the cops'll never bother to look

And the clowns have all gone to bed  
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street  
Footsteps dressed in red  
And the wind whispers Mary  
A broom is drearily sweeping  
Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life  
Somewhere a queen is weeping  
Somewhere a king has no wife  
And the wind, it cries Mary  
The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow  
And shine their emptiness down on my bed  
The tiny island sags down stream  
'cause the life that lived is,  
Is dead  
And the wind screams Mary  
Uh-will the wind ever remember  
The names it has blow in the past?  
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom  
It whispers no, this will be the last  
And the wind cries Mary

I can't stop this grinning  
So assume I'm winning  
Threw pessimism  
In the air it's spinning  
Crashing to the floor and nevermore  
Will it lure me away with sweets  
And shiny things just like a magpie  
  
Now every bird and bee just fuel the fire for me  
Now every closing door just fans the flames some more

Take you to the brink thing.  
I want to introduce you,  
Tell me what you think thing. I want to introduce you,  
Make that missing link thing.  
Don't you think it's time you met some female pink thing?  
  
You make me want to laugh,  
You make me want to cry,  
So why is it I'm happy when there's tears down in your eye?

Intro:  
  
Listen you fuckers, you screwheads  
Here's a man who won't take it anymore  
A man who stood up against  
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit  
Here is some one who stood up  
Here is...  
  
Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies  
presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life  
Yeah! check it  
  
Verse One:  
  
It took a long time comin but we waited  
Xzibit went from underated  
To now most antcipaded  
never would of thought that I would rock your set  
And get love and respect without no special effects  
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need  
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed  
thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed  
Tryin to glority greed  
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!  
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed  
Have it laid out for your seed  
But the world gets colder every day by day  
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.  
Trying to find piece of mind  
is like trying to find a gold mine  
it just won't happen  
no time for relaxin  
Real soldiers of fortune  
the front line of the action  
So never show a nigga what you packin'  
""You know what i'm sayin'?""  
It's too much weight to be juggling  
who do you picture when you think about struggling  
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin  
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah!  
yes movin...  
At the speed of life  
  
Verse Two:  
  
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes  
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind  
and when I die!  
Niggas still recite these lines  
to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns  
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  
the underground! to upper echelon and beyond  
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond  
Nigga want to trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch  
mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon  
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone  
It's the law of the land  
a straight modern day babylon!  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah! yeah! like this  
Like this...at the speed of life  
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!  
  
Verse Three:  
  
Xzibit lookin at the earth through wide angles  
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels  
Where small situations turn to altercation  
with a heavy ass price  
'cause niggas don't fight no more!  
before hip hop was all about drama  
anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona  
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma  
Just me and my bottle  
we shall lead not follow  
Emcees be full of shit  
but they style be hollow  
it seems you've bitin off more  
than you can possibly swallow  
just a day in the life of a man named X  
only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex  
you see niggas comin through to smoke and pay respect  
ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything  
whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion  
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion  
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst  
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first  
Yeah! we got it locked down tight  
Xzibit bring truth to the light  
shit is movin at the speed of life  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...  
At the speed of life

Xzibit,Everything,/x/xzibit/everything_21046454.html,"[Chorus]  
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen  
I remember underage drinking at sixteen  
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen  
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything  
  
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me  
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet  
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat  
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly  
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions  
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position  
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag  
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass  
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out  
Picking the shit up where I left off  
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel  
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle  
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business  
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance  
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me  
And make that money stack higher than giraffes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack  
So it will leave no shells at the scene  
Where I was getting my kid back  
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up  
On hard to make the west defined a united fund  
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck  
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California  
Where people fake it 'till they make it  
Or take it with their hand gun  
Take your chances, swing, try to land one  
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness  
My symphony deliver something classic  
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it  
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?  
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity  
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony  
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back  
Gave my girl a son and my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in  
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins  
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in  
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything  
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind  
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind  
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors  
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message  
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence  
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence  
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me  
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy

Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover

Longtitude and latitude

I'm in the mood to put a twist on things  
Xzibit here to rock the planet 'till the fat bitch sings  
The shit is closer than you think  
Don't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds  
I'd like to say this off the record  
But it's not  
So I testify to the fact  
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact  
It makes it real easy to trip  
Unload the whole clip on your block then split!  
ain't no answers to the test you taken  
Never move fakin'  
Can't be shaken'

It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us  
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust  
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked  
Ready to rock  
Then shake the spot  
The Foundation  
  
You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers  
Who forever smoke bud  
So it's probably in your blood  
Realize you can only run the streets so long  
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone  
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong  
Same shit different day  
It's the same ol' song  
If the time ever comes that I meet my match  
Take control of my assets  
Fuck startin' from scratch  
Take care of your mother  
Keep yourself on track  
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back  
Beware of the serpent  
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike  
And try to make you loose sight  
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real  
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill  
Son if you ever pull heat  
Then use it  
If you got a chance to walk away  
Then do it  
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations  
A solid foundation  
  
You are the foundation  
Beginning of a new generation  
I remember hospital hallway pacin'  
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine  
Only to find that yours looked like mine  
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time  
In this life you can't press stop  
Then press rewind  
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man  
Have your own plan, expand your mind  
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs  
This is nothing but love  
Via satellite Mug gs  
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life  
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife  
Be prepared for the worst  
But expect the best  
No matter where life takes you  
Come home to the West  
Survival takes more than just gats and guns  
That's words to live by  
From a father to a son

It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Yeah, blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up  
I'm alge-ballin', dumb niggaz can't add it up  
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up  
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin' up  
Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at  
You the king of the streets? Well, I ain't heard none of that  
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say  
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, 'Did it My Way'  
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied  
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide  
Recognize, lost a lotta love when my momma died  
Did a gang of shit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive  
Fishburn's yellin' wake up, open up my eyes  
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize

Go ahead, spit it out, that's right, get it out  
So I can respond, nigga, fuck what you talk about  
Drop like a guillotine, money over everythin'  
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine  
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit  
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship  
Came a long way from the place that I started from  
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?  
Hate manifest from the inside out  
The shit starts in your heart, then spill out your mouth  
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out  
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out  
Now that I found that my path is original  
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle  
I'm not like you, but you think we identical  
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Three wheels, lock it up, ammo, stock it up  
It's not for niggaz 'cause George Bush comin' after us  
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go  
All my people fightin' for they soul, you are not alone  
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant  
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it  
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit  
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, overkill shit  
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize  
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line  
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit  
You know that young shit, the 'Hey nigga, where you from?' shit  
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman  
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand  
Let's part ways and then pray for better days  
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say

Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while  
Xzibit stay versitile  
With Million Dollar lifestyle  
And I can feel it as a child growin' up  
  
The niggaz that were real and the niggaz that were scared as fuck  
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few  
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you  
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin shit  
  
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin with  
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof ticket  
Nigga you make a gang of noise and never seem like a cricket  
I guess that's why we never kick it  
  
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin to fuck with the liquid  
How many niggaz do you know like this?  
Also claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch  
It don't make sense  
  
Either you're a soldier from the start  
Or an actor with a record deal tryin to play the part  
Like dat

It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
EXTRA LARGE  
It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
Paparazzi  
  
I don't need no lights no cameras  
Just action god dammit  
Never no superstar  
I'm more like a planet  
  
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat  
A merchant from the fog with my fucked up dialogue  
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt  
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck  
  
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis  
Home of the scandalous  
Big Bad Los Angeles  
Dangerous, Vandelous  
  
Yo, not to be trusted  
So how the fuck is you hard  
Not being scared by the boulevard  
I'm pulling that card and sayin Gin muthafuckar  
  
Flowin like liquid, soak it in muthafuckar  
I'm breakin it down, my sounds, so crowds are like deaf  
From the West  
Puttin whole counties to the test  
  
It's all in perspective  
Breaker one-nine copy  
This is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the Paparazzi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress  
But I just play the back  
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams  
For a contract  
  
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel  
I made a cool half mil  
Before I had a record deal  
There for you look and stare like it's magic  
  
Too much of anything can make you an addict  
When devils be startin static, forgot the automatic  
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait  
Who dare to cross this path  
  
Yo, I do ya like math  
Cut with glass, make a blood bath  
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with  
Smoke a lot of blunts with  
  
I dispose of your punk shit  
Keep it all in perspective

Do I take that as normal and watch her play with her tits?

Now what am I doin' here?  
She tell me she wants to keep the condom as a souvenir  
And that's kinda weird to me

Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me  
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike  
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic  
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'  
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'

How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus

Since a juvenile callin'  
Shots in the dorm  
Moms said you better get right  
Or shake the spot  
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone  
Like pop  
Stashin' the rocks by the gats  
With the Gs  
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!  
I don't fight the feelin'  
Gotta hustle with a passion  
Comin' cross state to put you down  
With some action  
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets  
Remininsin' younger days

You know protect and serve, a couple traffic stops  
I make a bust, and take something out the top  
A thin blue line, we run these streets  
You bang on them, but never bang on me  
I cell search, stepping on pillows and sheets  
I'm the police, treat a nigga just like fresh meat  
I got a short wick, on some New York shit  
Take you to the precinct and fuck you with a broomstick  
I patrol your hood, put you on my hood  
Leave you in the wrong hood, got it understood  
PC 647b, that's a prostitute, plus she kind of cute  
She don't want to jail, well bitch I'll tell you what  
Get on your muthafuckin' knees, suck my partner up

Pulled a couple strings, dodge the media beef  
Ever since them niggaz in black said ""Fuck the police""

Waiting for some, get back like it or not  
We investigated the shots, that killed Biggie and Pac  
Ever wonder why nobody ever figured it out  
Cause we the ones that got to figure it out  
I shout freeze at the top of my lungs  
I'm the cream of the crop  
You don't stop you get popped by my warning shots  
And if you try to come back, with a civil suit  
I sit back and watch my system take a shit on you

Order in the court, Order in the court

I'm going to let it slide, show you who you can trust  
And if you want to keep selling, nigga you sell for us  
Make you a 1030, I'll get you hands dirty  
Murder for hire, professional liar  
I plan to make police chief and then retire

I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks  
So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips

When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back  
Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at  
And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back  
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day  
Playin the price for the games you play  
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away  
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like  
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life  
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened  
Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin  
Sellin everything from weed to blow  
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know  
niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power  
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours  
? tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters  
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off  
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit  
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch  
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak  
And then physically and mentally cannot compete  
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster  
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster  
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin  
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin  
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count  
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out  
But some of these niggaz on swipe  
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked  
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans  
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans  
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands  
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again

Dress out expandin shit, today my release date

So I tried in vain to write it again

They didn't even try

Before you had the chance to die.

Expecting to turn and see you there  
I ran my fingers through the long grass  
Willing it to turn into your hair, and oh  
I'm gonna miss you, dear  
But I don't have to cry  
  
I'm so glad that you left us now,

I watch his lips caress the glass,  
His fingers stroke its stem and pass

That god is on our side  
Even Jesus cheers us on  
Against the other side  
Against the other side.  
  
He who shouts the loudest  
Is the one who's in control  
We who never listen  
Are the ones who pay the toll  
Tell us that it's time at last  
To make a final stand  
I'm glad 'cause all I wanted  
Was to kill another man  
Just to kill another man.

Don't ask why

Too young to die

Yello,Ocean Club,/y/yello/ocean+club_20148224.html,"My name is Norman, Lou Norman.  
I've been in this business for fifteen years.  
If people have a problem and don't want talk to the police, they want talk to
me.  
So, this Friday afternoon I got a phone call,  
Young lady asked me to go downtown.  
  
What the hell is a girl like Mandy Cooper doing at the lower Manhattan Ocean
Club?  
Looking like a taxi [Texan?] model  
And with a voice like Mahalia Jackson.  
She don't need to work in slots like this.  
She got the pair of blue eyes that look green to me.  
And then she approached me.  
Oh boy  
  
Miss Cooper, I suppose?  
Let's stop playing games.  
I'm on the job here, let's come to terms.  
She tried to wind me up with some nonsense about an ex-boyfriend who was
giving her a hard time.  
I said listen honey, we all know you can help yourself.  
If you want me to work on your case, let's get things straight, and now.  
Oh boy  
  
Nobody is ever gonna damage your career.  
With a voice like this and a pair of eyes, you're gonna be huge in any
business.  
You still don't smoke?  
I need a drink.  
And maybe you'll join me.  
Looks better for the chappy over there  
Looks like old friends  
Meeting after a hard night's work.  
  
I walked to the corner slowly,  
Wanted to ask Mr. Big here for a light.  
He turned around.  
  
I put a quarter into the jukebox and played a beautiful Ave Maria  
When I turned around, Miss Cooper had gone.

Outside a window  
I still can't believe where I am now

Adventures come and gone  
And I'm left alone but not let down  
  
'Cause I have found a gravity  
A voice that pulls me to my knees  
Telling me ""Remember where you're from""  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes

When I could truly say I'm better now  
Well here I am  
'Cause I have left this gravity  
Grab a hold and carry me  
And I will not forget where I am from  
Forget where I am from  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes

I'm right where I belong  
Feel the air, the salt on my skin  
The future's coming on  
And after living through these wild years  
I'm coming out alive  
I just wanna lay my head here  
And stop running for a while

Yes,Circus Of Heaven,/y/yes/circus+of+heaven_20148446.html,"The day the Circus of Heaven came to town  
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town  
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around  
On the very last day  
  
A unicorn headed the mystical way  
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play  
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colors of jade  
On the very final day  
  
For what seemed only just a moment in time  
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by  
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold  
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time  
There then arose where nothing really stood there before  
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor  
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed  
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age  
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound  
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round  
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen  
From historical or mythical scenes  
  
Then there above their heads just as vivid as life  
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light  
Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon  
A play of millions roared along  
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great  
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate  
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way  
The day the circus came to town  
  
Outside great animals as tame as the trees  
Angels high in starlight dancing streets  
Turning their colors with indigo and gold  
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow  
As the circus finally changed its invisible course  
A new world to be found  
  
On the dreamy ground we walked upon  
I turned to my son and said  
""Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary  
beautiful?""  
  
""Oh! It was OK!! But there were no clowns, no tigers, lions or bears,  
cand-floss, toffee apples, no clowns.""

Yes,Close To The Edge,/y/yes/close+to+the+edge_20148493.html,"A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,  
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,  
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,  
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.  
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.  
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,  
And take away the plain in which we move,  
And choose the course you're running.  
  
Down at the edge, round by the corner,  
Not right away, not right away.  
Close to the edge, down by a river,  
Not right away, not right away.  
  
Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,  
Reaching out to call the color of the sky.  
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.  
Getting over all the time I had to worry,  
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.  
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.  
  
Down at the end, round by the corner.  
Close to the edge, just by a river.  
Seasons will pass you by.  
I get up, I get down.  
Now that it's all over and done,  
Now that you find, now that you're whole.  
  
My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.  
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.  
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.  
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.  
  
Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,  
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea.  
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.  
  
Down at the edge, close by a river.  
Close to the edge, round by the corner.  
Close to the end, down by the corner.  
Down at the edge, round by the river.  
  
Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory.  
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.  
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.  
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,  
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.  
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.  
  
Down at the edge, round by the corner.  
Close to the end, down by a river.  
Seasons will pass you by.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking.  
Saying that she'd take the blame  
For the crucifixion of her own domain.  
  
I get up,  
I get down,  
I get up,  
I get down.  
  
Two million people barely satisfy.  
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.  
The eyes of honesty can achieve.  
How many millions do we deceive each day?  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
In charge of who is there in charge of me.  
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?  
The truth is written all along the page.  
How old will I be before I come of age for you?  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
  
The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.  
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems.  
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.  
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.  
Ah, ah.  
  
Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,  
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.  
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.  
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,  
Called to witness cycles only of the past.  
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.  
  
Close to the edge, down by the river.  
Down at the end, round by the corner.  
Seasons will pass you by,  
Now that it's all over and done,  
Called to the seed, right to the sun.  
Now that you find, now that you're whole.  
Seasons will pass you by,  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up, I get down.  
I get up.

Like ecstasy  
The sound of trees

What a baby sees  
  
Beautiful face, alright  
Many a place, outta sight  
Old woman there with red shoes  
One million balloons, all used  
Drive over hills, forget your fear  
Getting it out of second gear
