Train,Ordinary,/t/train/ordinary_10235595.html,"Whose eyes in my behind  
I don't recognize anything that I see  
Whose skin is this design  
I don't want this to be the way that you see me  
  
I don't understand anything anymore  
And this web that I'm tied up  
Is taking me right up these walls  
That I climb up to get to your story  
It's anything but ordinary  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I get nothing but left behind  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
Can you save me from this world of mine  
Before I get myself arrested with these expectations  
You are the one, look what you've done  
What have you done  
This is not some kind of joke  
You're just a kid  
You weren't ready for what you did, no  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I do it for you time after time  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
I think I'm trying to save the world for you  
You've been saving me too  
We could just stay and save each other  
  
I'm anything but ordinary  
I'm anything but ordinary

Someday you'll be the one  
Out here on the open  
I get to keep what's mine  
It's hard to live up to you  
When you're never doing anything wrong

It's hard to live up to what you think of yourself  
You know you've got to be putting me on

Underneath the sky  
Out here where I'm hoping  
I wanna get my wings and fly  
Out here on the open

Got to get yourself up right  
So what you finally tell you that you're too uptight  
Hey hey  
That's what I say  
You've been working at the carwash way too long  
You know that life is just about another funky song  
Hey hey hey hey, that's what you say  
Out here in the open  
Underneath my name  
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me  
Someday everybody's gonna pay attention to me  
And out here in the open, I get the chance to shine  
Out here in the open, yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me

And makes you feel like giving in

And I will chase away the way we push

Up the coast to catch some sun  
That left me with these blisters on my skin  
Don't know what I was on,  
But I think it grows in Oregon,  
So I kept on goin' going on right through

So wrap me up return to sender  
Let's forget this five day bender  
Take me to my city by the bay!  
  
I never knew all that I had,  
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad  
At least they have a hella fine merlot  
If I could wish upon a star  
I would hitch a cable car  
To the place that I can always call my own

Always orders sushi, only eats the rice

You started breaking ground on a new frontier  
Always makin' love, but never with me

These eyes got too wide seen too much of life's goodbyes  
Should have spent less time making loot  
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you  
  
And everybody upstairs, everybody down stairs  
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

Everybody prayin', everybody singing

But who's to say who's right with things like this  
There's so much that we miss  
Tryin' so hard to be rich and famous  
Pretty and thin, to win  
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young  
  
So forget everything and just be with me here now  
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot  
  
You, not Etta James, Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way  
You, not Sitting Bull, Ella or Bach and I almost forgot

Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing

And they told her that she better had

And it's easy to be on your guard  
But it's harder just to be who you are

When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
Then you will find  
You can do much better than that  
If you think of all the things that you feel  
All the voices in your head that you hear  
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on  
  
When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
And you will find  
You can do much better than that  
  
If you see me hit the ground  
Don't come near don't make a sound  
  
I was walking along in the sun  
Taking pictures of everyone  
And there's something on the tip of my tongue

I can change, I swear

I'm only at it again  
As an addict with a pen  
Who's addicted to the wind  
As it blows me back and fourth  
Mindless, spineless, and pretend  
Of course I'll be here again  
See you tomorrow  
But it's the end of today  
End of my ways  
As a walking denial

Suicidal head case

And I just can't hide

The horrors of the night melt away  
Under the warm glow of survival of the day  
Then we move on,  
My shadow grows taller along with my fears  
And my friends shrink smaller as night grows near  
  
When the sun is coming, window soothes  
And the silver lining rides the hills  
I will be saved for one whole day  
Until the sun make the hills its grave

It just hit me as I lay my head down,  
No one around,  
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound  
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.  
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.  
  
It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams,  
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me,  
Forcing me out,  
Making me think about you and how you're gone.  
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way,  
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day,  
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight,  
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.  
  
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say,  
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today,  
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week,  
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Spending hours on end  
Deciding what I'd say to a friend  
If I ever saw 'em again,  
  
'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.  
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.  
  
Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.  
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?  
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things,  
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.

Down a route I think is heading south  
But I'm not good with directions  
And I hide behind my mouth  
I'm a pro at imperfections  
And I'm best friends with my doubt

The city walls are all come down  
The dust, a smoke screen all around  
See faces ploughed like fields that once  
Gave no resistance  
  
And we live by the side of the road  
On the side of a hill  
As the valley explode  
Dislocated, suffocated  
The land grows weary of its own  
  
Oh, oh, oh on borderland we run  
And still we run  
We run and don't look back

I'll be there somehow  
I'll be there tonight  
Tonight  
  
The wind will crack in winter time  
This bomb-blast lightning waltz  
No spoken words, just a scream  
  
Tonight we'll build a bridge  
Across the sea and land  
See the sky, the burning rain  
She will die and live again  
Tonight  
  
And your heart beats so slow  
Through the rain and fallen snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light's in the distance  
  
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep  
For tonight, at last  
I am coming home

Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears

The scent of it lingers but then it just goes

The best of us are geniuses of compression

Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you

Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love

We were barely conscious  
Two souls too smart to be  
In the realm of certainty  
Even on our wedding day  
  
We set ourselves on fire  
A girl could not deny her  
Its not if I believe in love  
If love believes in me  
Oh believe in me

I'm falling to my knees

And they did not notice me

At the alter of a Dark star  
My body s now begging  
Though it's begging to get back  
Begging to get back  
To my heart  
To the rhythm of my soul  
To the rhythm of my consciousness  
To the rhythm of yes  
To be released from control  
  
I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine  
I could see in the reflection  
A face staring back at me

Through the stations of the cross  
Every eye looking every other way  
Counting down till the pain will stop

A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Oh, yeah!  
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie  
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change  
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange

UB40,Sins Of The Fathers,/u/ub40/sins+of+the+fathers_20719422.html,"Once upon a time, not so long ago  
When things were much much simple  
And time would travel slow  
  
There came a righteous stranger  
With a bible in his hand  
To educate the sinner  
And liberate the land  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The sins of the fathers  
Have visited from old  
In a never ending circle  
Of people bought and sold  
So the wretched of the earth  
Would huddle from the cold  
As a ship of fools go sailing  
On an Ocean black as gold  
  
So come and sit beside me  
And let my tale unfold  
In a land on milk and honey  
Where the truth must not be told  
As men of right and reason  
Let the devil take their soul  
For greed and fame and fortune  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all the non believers  
Where hiding from the light  
As a thousand burning crosses  
Were scattered in the night  
The thieves and the vagabonds  
Were sinking in the sand  
As a righteous lord and master  
Stretches out a helping hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And those who had to suffer  
The sick the young the old  
Where sacrifice to fortune  
And left out in the cold  
So with this new arrangement  
The leaders sold their souls  
For bangles, beads and baubles  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus x2]

Ufo,Flying,/u/ufo/flying_20141854.html,"[disputed lyrics in brackets]  
Have you ever had the time to see, me and you could change to be  
Take a dream away with you live it now and you will see  
Found myself on an open road [got no hand] to show the way  
Upped and started walking on to a land seemed so far away  
After so long felt I was damned then I reached some gates and held a hand  
But came to the point of sing and say, laughing people led me in to stay  
Their happiness [held me, made me ] strong. I felt this is where I belong  
I don't want another day just wanna laugh live sing and say  
It's so strange I feel this way, it's so real, it's happening today,  
Stop still something burns my body falls I begin to turn  
(instrumental verse)  
Flying drifting falling down, I found myself beneath the ground,  
In a place that's strange to me, the earth is black and there's not a tree  
Well it's so dark there's not a sound just the feeling of wanting to be found  
I must make haste to be gone, in this place I do not belong  
I thought I tried to move a foot, I just remained where I stood,  
And in the distance I heard aloud the shrill of blank deathly sound  
I tried, I tried, I tried to run, but every move I was where I begun,  
It's too late, shadows over me blind my eyes I cannot see  
All my strength all my love, someone help me please above,  
Death will surely take me down, I'll be doomed to live beneath the ground  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one,] see your tomb, see you run, you fool, you fool
your life has just begun  
I'm here to taunt and torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to  
Black it out and drag you down, all kinds of evil wear a crown  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free I can be just anyone that I want to be  
Leave me now get out of my way  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one] see your tomb, see your rock, who are you fooling
life's just begun  
Here to taunt, to torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to,  
Knock it out drag you down, all kinds of people were aware of it now?  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free so leave me alone I wanna go my way and be alone  
Get out of my sight, get out of my way  
(more instrumental)  
I'm not through, and I'm on the run, you're the fool my life's not been done  
I'll taunt you and I'll torment you  
(instrumental)  
Have this way with a dream never leave me so it seems  
Life by night, life by day, the tale they tell will always stay  
Walk the earth, walk the sky, don't let all this time go by  
Hang on fast, don't let go or someone else will never know  
Ride a road along with me chase a dream we all can see  
Don't let bad, just see good it's all that just what you should  
No truth will ever come along shine so bright in your eyes  
No wide wonder will do that for you, just lock it fast, do what you got to do  
Shout it loud, shout out loud just live how you want to be  
Show yourself show yourself, live how you got to be

taped backwards: ""though I've belted you and flayed you, by the living God
that made you, you're a bette

And then, in ultra super-slo-mo, ""yes we know it's all be done before before

You got that envy cause they won't understand  
  
The social life you lead leaves nothin' to desire  
Don't wanna see you bleed  
But you came on like a liar

Wrecked myself to love you  
All you want is more  
One thing you're after  
You just try and score

Cuts your body to the bone  
Oh no, its a strange, strange feeling  
Loves been abandoned and I'm so alone  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I've nothing left but this very life to save  
And evrey night I feel that I'm a winner  
She's taking me down to the grave  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I can't seem to chase the ghosts away  
And every night I get too high, I'm a winner  
I've nothing left but to pray  
  
And every night she makes me feel like a winner  
And every night she makes me think I'm a winner  
Venus smiles and encircles me  
And wraps me in a soft princely gown  
  
Waves of darkness rise like the sea  
In her addiction I will drown

Oh what a beautiful sight  
You'd cool it up  
Or you'd cool it down  
From some dizzy, dizzy height  
I can still hear that rolling sound  
Like a diesel in my head  
Sometimes I wake and I think of you now  
Forgetting that you're dead  
I was born on a rolling train  
Runnin' when I hit the ground  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Well  
This hotel rooms like the wild, wild west  
And there's strangers moving underground  
I still have your photograph  
It picks me up when I'm feeling down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me one  
Let's kick back and let it roll  
There's nothing here  
And there's nothing left  
But watching the daylight go to town  
We'd get swept up on a pillow fight  
You just couldn't let it go  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Don't you fade away  
solo  
Well I guess I'm walking right back home  
Got to set this all down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me two  
'cause there's nothing here,nothing left  
But watching the daylight turn around  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Watching this world spin around  
Watching the daylight go to town

From the Civic Center in Boston, Massachusetts  
The world famous Ultramagnetic MC's comin' hard  
Word up!  
Rockin' for a standing room only crowd  
Of fifty-five million, eight-thousand nine  
""Rebel base.. rebel base""  
Like this!  
  
I got a radio, small and yet portable  
Comfortable, with the sound in audio  
Kickin', high hats just tickin'  
Spicy lyrics, and words finger lickin'... good  
But you know I could  
Beat on steel, break tons of wood.. down with a funky sound  
Square mixer, the record is round  
And turning, for the million I'm earning  
Shock the rhythm, and just keep learning  
  
This, that is supposed to  
Grab your ear, and have it move close  
To the speakers, so you hear me clearly  
I'm out yes, to damage severely  
You're very far, and not yet nearly  
Expressing them, but you're messing them up  
Your bummy rhymes, I'm dressing them up  
For the battle win, like a snake I'm rattlin'  
The red ball with the wooden piece paddlin'  
MC's, stop the perpetrating  
And step off, release the mic and Break North

Word  
It's like that y'all  
Feel it!

Computer rapper for ducks who wanna bite em  
Stand back, watch the man recite em  
It took a minute a second for me to write em  
And type em and hype em and psych em, up  
Change my rhythm, before I get stuck  
In an altitude, beyond my own level  
I smack rappers, and send em to the devil  
  
On a bus, return em to dust  
I start infections, reduce em to pus  
I'm on that scanner, and brains I blow out  
To old bones, and skulls I throw out  
To the backyard, and yes the wackyard  
You need a pipe, there's the old crackyard  
Your last stop, it has to be the graveyard  
Peakin', Ced Gee I'm speakin'  
I smell smoke, my tonsils are leakin'  
Words, in the right direction  
Add the beats with the lyrics perfection  
Stompin', the bass and highs, break north  
  
Word up! Word - feel it!  
  
Well I'm rocks, like a chain to a link  
I wear black while suckers wear pink  
Now think, about my capital law  
I break domes, and speak in the raw  
I'm iller, a South Bronx killer  
I chop rappers, and throw em in the river  
Tastin', as I swallow your liver  
Here's your brain for your girl I can give her  
Messages, clues from a murderer  
And if she's ugly, I never even heard of her  
  
Telling, bugging detectives  
I wear a bag, four contraceptives  
And aluminum, wrapped in all foil  
I play a game, slick to be oil  
For the other roaches, MC's I boil  
And roast, mega degrees  
I swarm around with a thousand of bees  
Absorb earth and the honey from trees  
I'm the King Bee, my girl's the Queen Bee  
And when you're stung, you never even seen me  
Vanish, Kool Keith here to damage, break north  
North, north, north

It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all

The movie, you seen on TV  
I'll be numerous, but believe me  
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver  
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe  
Sealed and delivered, by me  
The manufacturer  
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya  
And if ya run, I have to damage ya  
mentally, by using my mind  
Choosing adjectives hard to define  
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece  
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece  
open, hopin you'll say to me  
""That was dope,"" like an anatomy  
operation on the turntables  
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled  
Equipped, with a white handkerchief  
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this  
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker  
With the line I wrote, and I quote them  
Cause I'm feelin' it!  
  
""You've got the feeling""  
[C.Gee] I feel it.. one more time man  
""You've got the feeling""  
[Keith] Just another Boogie Down Bronx sure shot  
""You've got the feeling""  
[C.Gee] Word up, 4-3 Mission posse in effect  
""You've got the feeling""  
To my man Tim Southfield  
? my next door neighbor  
Hollywood House family  
Oh the whole 9 crew, Dexter, everybody

For you dummies, ironically stupid  
What are you, Cupid?  
You steal my rhymes, and then you loop it  
  
Wrong! Back this way  
Follow me now, head this way  
Into this, while I rap on through this  
For many germs, who never knew this  
  
Switches, upside down  
Turn around, look in the mirror  
You rap catchers are makin' a error  
Every inning, I'm back to the dugout  
  
You on the field, I'm ready to bugout  
Like a manager, smackin' up your team  
Male or female, ducks who dream  
Of takin' me, on the mic and makin' me  
Rack up, MC's I stack up  
  
Foreign precinct rappers need to back up  
Quickly, I'm a rip your brain off  
Throw it down so the blood can drain off  
My hands, while I wave to a fan  
  
I'm Kool Keith, not a Bill or a Dan  
But a General, equal to a mineral  
Pushin' a crowd, to keep on dancin'  
I'm Housing Things  
  
Now I'm back, to continue my verses  
I'm never screamin' loud with any curses  
Rougly, that a child can learn  
I teach kids and ducks that burn  
  
With a flamethrower, and how do you show a...  
Grass rapper, cut him with a lawnmower  
Twice, into golden wheat  
Ground the rest into moldin meat  
  
And cook em, til' they all well done  
They not ready, they don't smell done  
like fish, it ain't my favorite dish  
I grab a steak and to battle I wish  
  
A Coke MC or Pepsi I'll sip up  
Drop your face and bring the other lip up  
Watch, while I stun and amaze you  
Kick out lyrics that truly daze you  
  
I'm your boss, the one that pays you  
Nine to five, all ducks are hired  
And when I come MC's are fired  
No pay, no way today  
  
You're an employer with nothin' to say  
But I can say, one thing for sure  
I'm Housing Things  
  
I think it's pitiful, that you had taunted me  
Your girl sulkin', she wanted me first  
Before you was thought about  
Back in the days, when I taught about  
  
Science, the real construction  
No other solo team or production  
Did that, or got with that  
I play brain ball using a bat  
  
To your skull, smack it out the park  
I rhyme bright and you're in the dark  
With shadows, hallucinating battles  
To compel, the capital K, as in Kool  
  
Combined in Keith  
Rap metal is terminal chief  
And joy, squashin' the beef  
On time. and my mic will stay on  
  
For any roach or germ who wanna pray on  
a weakness, but my uniqueness  
has a way to show that I'm slicker  
Creating rhymes, you have to be, quicker  
And versatile on the microphone  
I'm Kool Keith, cold Housing Things  
  
And I'd like to say what's up to my man, Father Mashon  
And also my brother Kevvy Kev, Ced Gee, Moe Love, TR  
And my man I God, Paul C, Public Enemy and the Jungle Brothers

Taking stroud while your face and arms drop  
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write learn to talk, learn to walk

Kleptomaniac, my rhyme is psycho  
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo  
Sporting a rag top, an El Dorado  
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards  
The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull it's card  
Jack or Ace, King or Queen, call me the deuce  
I'm pouring L.A. juice hitting the top, feeling the rim  
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them  
On and on, on and on, on and on until the break of dawn  
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime  
Daytime, switching off to Prime time  
Specifically, strolling back in the west time  
Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme  
Hype and dope, hype the frame, the mic is smoking  
Yo, I ain't joking  
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp  
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to romp  
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll  
Rhyme to destroy anything toy boy

As I flow and grow from head to toe

Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand

The crowd is loud, you can pay as the manager  
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya  
Boom, taking life more serious  
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious  
Rhymes are grip tight, no grams to kill more  
A son of Sam, how could I begin more  
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows  
You're in living hell, the funk, pound to pound  
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing  
I'm coming out in sighting  
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula  
Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular  
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the  
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows  
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose  
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one  
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one  
Look at the master, my range is higher  
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

Our jets, should be ready for take off, any second

Incite the first gadget, my atom explodes  
Just hit the fifth planet, the x reload  
Take a brother on a flight for the alpha, omega

A spacewalker, dippin in my spacecraft  
Through molecules, a steel wall interphase

Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse

Feeding the world of gamma data, to locate  
You interlock, power 7 warp speed

Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini  
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine eight seven six  
Five four three - the chain reaction  
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper  
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it  
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast  
Yes approximate, green in the chambers  
The lights came on, infrared and exciting  
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams  
Beams beams beams beams beams beams  
Beams beams beams...  
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean the phantom  
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them  
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to persia  
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker

Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you to carry me through  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You help me along makin' me strong

And I don't care for playin' games

I stumbled around that Texas town but I never left Sixth Street  
You know it's always hard to keep my feet from tryin' to run away  
And it seems I spent a lifetime tryin' to make everything ok  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her

Play that tambourine

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so  
And I'd walk a million miles on down the same old broken road  
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know that's true  
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet won't fit these shoes  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me

Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me

Like a south bound train like fallin' rain like a whisper in my ear  
Everything I'd like to hear you know I don't hear much no more  
But I know someday that you'll come my way and you'll walk right through that
door

He got that their legendary cabin down in Tennessee  
You know he'll hook up that guitar everybody gather round  
You stay close to the fire when the sun goes down  
Old Brother Merle he's always waiting in the wings  
Only man up in them woods wearin' all them gold rings  
Old Mr. Hawkins he won't do nobody wrong

Read even though we lost, I still love you  
I keep it like a locket on a chain  
I tell myself that I've moved on but only half the way

Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I'd have some words to say  
Ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes

And a string of things I didn't do back then  
No doubt I'm better off havin' had you

Taught me how to lose it too

Rocked in basements for gas and beer  
And now I get all that and big loot to appear  
I couldn't steer so I got me a chauffer  
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers  
I got over and people showed envy  
Cause I couldn't choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy  
Fendi shades and topless maids  
I don't worry about clothes cause their custom made  
I drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years

The tribulation time will come  
The storms will hurl the midnight fear  
And sweep lost millions to their doom

So tear another page from the book  
Are you asleep or just alone  
Clear this room from your lungs  
And pull yourself together man  
  
On your back, you're sleeping in a bed of shame  
Let the light breathe some new life into this room

You're busy making vows

And a destructive plan

A reputation of  
The highest resistance  
A mean runner bringing order

Don't believe in feelings

Got no time for off-the-wall talk  
Don't care who I tread on

Bad bad man, I'm a bad bad man

With you it's everything  
On my tongue the taste of love  
Never felt so good  
Easy come  
No more waitin' at the back door  
One on one  
I could live like this forever  
One on one  
Take me all the way to heaven  
One on one  
Love runs in so easily  
One on one  
All you give is what I need

Games with my mind  
Stopped in my tracks  
No thought of looking back  
The lady's got me tied up  
But I've already made my mind up  
One way or another  
She'll be mine  
  
It wasn't anything I could define  
None of those ringing bells  
Giving me a sign  
I just took a look  
But I was on the hook  
The lady's got me tied up

One way or another

That a forever kind of love  
Is the kind of love  
I'll look for forever  
But still I'll love and love again  
One way or another  
I will find my friend

Would lead my head  
Beyond the path  
My chosen life had led  
I'd been so sure  
But where is the cure

What I should do

A gray cloud they say  
Hides a surprise  
But it rained until I lost my belief  
Just close your eyes  
We'll show you the way

While another soul wields the sword  
I hear you all, but I still can't see

Who speaks the chosen word

Coming down on me  
Long arm of the law  
Never setting me free  
Rough justice, I bide my time  
  
Back in action, I'm riding the crest  
And putting all that  
I've learned to the test

Freedom of choice  
Free to be right back here

Stealing every moment of his time

Stand waiting to die  
How can we do what must be done  
In just one short life  
  
And if you ask  
Then you must know  
If you still doubt  
You should be told  
It was not we  
That made it so  
It was by those  
Who went before

Tomorrow's child  
So full of love  
So full of life

Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man,  
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am,  
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep,  
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets,  
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites,  
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie,  
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life,  
Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess,  
Better give my girl my best put my b.s. under arrest,  
Cause I love my lady,  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for
the ladies,  
Could'a picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong,  
Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, cause I love my lady,  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for
the ladies,

With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed,  
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play,  
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way,  
We started talking business, she handed me a card,  
We exchanged information, I rented me a car,  
While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts,  
Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby?s heart, no no no.

But lately I been slippin' up, fantasies bout dimes on the side,  
Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide,  
I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand,  
More and more chicks trying to get at me,  
Then I don't know what to do,  
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I,  
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose,  
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool,  
Make that move,  
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the
rules

Yeah you punching up her numbers in the ADT,  
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me,  
Better not feed feed feed that appetite,

I never gave you everything you want, thing you need  
  
All we ever do is argue all night long  
I don't want to leave you, see you  
With another brother lovin ya sayin'  
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl  
  
That's how I feel  
When you think everything is real  
But it really ain't  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
So much love and hurt

Got me up in Cartier every day just cause  
Got me arguin' about little stuff  
  
She don't call lil' stuff  
When it get a little rough,  
We me kiss and make up  
She want to say what she want to, I don't play that  
She want to constantly bring up shit from way back  
  
Got me thinkin' about her while I'm watchin' a flick  
Got me dippin through traffic tryin' to get home quick  
Got me talkin' to myself ""I'm hatin' this""  
Got me wantin' to wild out like I'm Jadakiss  
Got me in a place I never thought I would see  
Got me not wantin' to stay, and not wantin' to leave  
Got me happy  
Got me confused  
Got me wishin' I could get it how I used to

Everyday I'm tryna prove myself to you  
But what's the point  
No such thing as satisfying you  
Maybe you'll appreciate it later  
By the time I'm gone  
Better get your act together  
Don't wait too long  
Don't wanna change what we have  
So what do we had  
Girl I need you to know

Learn why I'm real, still that nigga  
I get money I ain't gotta do a crime

So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no  
Let that argument turn you on  
It's worth it  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love  
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye  
You learn all these lessons when you're in love  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
  
So hard to imagine living life without them there  
'Cause now you're so caught up in the passion  
But this shit is beyond compare, yeah  
Cause don't he make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum  
You fought hard but think about how hard you come  
  
So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no  
Just let that argument turn you on  
It's worth it  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love

But that don't mean I want to  
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just  
I feel like this is coming to an end  
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you  
I gotta let it burn  
[Verse 1]  
It's gonna burn for me to say this  
But it's coming from my heart  
It's been a long time coming  
But we done been fell apart  
Really wanna work this out  
But I don't think ya gonna change ya  
I do but you don't  
Think it's best we go our separate ways  
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship  
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby  
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with  
I think that you should let it burn  
[Chorus]  
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  
Even though this might bruise you  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Gotta let it burn  
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you  
Hate the thought of her being with someone else  
But you know that it's over  
You know that it was through

Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?  
It's the way I feel

What I gotta do now  
To get my shorty back  
Oh oh oh oh

Been through hell, now I'm hell proof  
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it  
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon  
Lost myself and lost my faith too  
  
[Hook]  
I've had my share of ups and downs  
I've had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
Stronger than ever now  
Ohh

Walk through fire now I'm fireproof  
Forever wear these scars like tattoos  
Finally found paradise right in my view  
And its killing me that I can't share it with you

I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now

[Verse]  
Though you're gone you still live in my mind  
The only thing we ran out of is time  
Since you left I ain't been quite the same  
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud  
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit  
I keep you right by my side  
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect  
Life will knock you down, get back up  
Fight for whats worth it  
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done  
  
[Bridge]  
Stronger than ever now  
I been through it, now stronger  
Stronger now, hey stronger now  
All that I been through some how I found my way out  
Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it  
I know you'll make it, cause you're stronger

We're here alone while the thunder is roaring  
And the windows are blowing  
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight  
I put my hand on your chest  
I can feel your heart  
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine  
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes  
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said  
I need you so much  
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, oooh  
(I need you)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again

Tell me that you wanna relieve love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're going to a whole 'nother level  
When we do it, it's so true  
And it's so much more than sexual tonight  
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected  
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for  
It gets better and better with time  
This is deeper than love  
The more of you I have the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh

Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah

Further than that

Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
I used to be young and dumb  
And always wanted to run in the streets  
'Cause I thought that was where it was at  
But it wasn't all it did was leave a brother in the cold  
  
With nowhere to go  
I caught myself slippin'  
Thinkin' I was the lick, I was trippin'  
Tried to jump dip to dip  
  
I thought it was a way to be happy  
Until somebody took time to tell me  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with

So many people think  
They got it - but they don't have a clue  
You gotta have more than just a body  
For me to be talkin' about you oh  
  
Take it from me when playin' the game you're day will come  
When you gotta stop and start lookin' for the world  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference

Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try.  
You need to sit down, this may take a while.  
You see, she sorta looks, just like you.  
She even smiles, just the way you do.  
So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled

But I was with it, and I'll admit that  
She was clear it was a kinda thing  
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go  
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time  
I got a head, some got left behind  
The world is yours, just sign this dotted line  
  
And in no time, I hear, money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts, damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I've faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys  
I stayed only mine, mind was on the money  
Had whatever, whenever, heart throb forever  
Black, young, and clever  
  
When you give it up, you get it on  
Love would be the only reason to look back  
And once you turn it on, you can't turn it off

On... 85 headed to the Plush  
Ten minutes later when we pulled up  
I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims  
Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims  
Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems  
Proceeded to walk in  
Just then I saw this  
Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris  
With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew

Keep it real what u wanna do  
I really wanna chill with u  
Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz  
But if we split up maybe we can hook up again

A shadow that won't leave us alone.  
You'll need to be a bit adventurous and have the courage to hurt.

On the black and white of a chessboard  
We met by chance  
There was a time when we'd lost our way and held each other close  
It's been a month since then. Do you remember?  
I would have been happy just to have watched  
The orange sunset next to you.  
But the mouth (words) is the origin of catastrophe  
Black clothes are only worn when  
Praying for the deceased.  
The mark of rouge leaves behind deep red purposely.  
If you say you can only paint  
Dreamless pictures  
How many times must  
I paint over the canvas?

She wonders, ""When will this end?""  
The world is full of money, full of money  
  
She goes out unprotected  
She doesn't listen to her best friend  
It's only for the money, for the money, for the money  
  
She doesn't want to be respected  
Reality's her best friend  
She needs the extra money, extra money  
  
In the city, the town, and the household  
So many things go unreported  
So many things her eyes have seen, eyes have seen, eyes have seen  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
This is not what she expected  
Her hopes, they stretch and they bend  
Wrinkle like paper money, paper money  
  
In the city, the town, and the household  
So many things can be distorted  
So if you want a true life story, bring money, bring money  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby

Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine

Everybody's looking lonely  
Catch me because I think I'm falling  
I'll be waiting in the mirrors of the hotel lobby

Utada Hikaru,In My Room,/u/utada+hikaru/in+my+room_10162375.html,"On a Tuesday morning we pass in the hallway  
But you don't notice  
I'm sure you don't even know my name  
But I don't care about that  
  
With fake nails, color contacts  
Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur  
Why am I looking for true love?  
Fighting is okay, but I'm tired of that  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If I close my mouth, lies and truth are the same  
  
It's a line that moves my soul, but I can't hear anything  
From far away someone is calling me  
But I don't yet want to return  
The noise of the city is comfortable  
  
Cold, kind, I'm enfolded in my own private zone  
Why am I always searching for a place to be?  
I laugh, I cry, I don't mind if I hurt people  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
  
That's why I'm always with you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same  
There are days when I want to run away  
And forget everything  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same

Utada Hikaru,Kremlin Dusk,/u/utada+hikaru/kremlin+dusk_10162368.html,"All along I was searching for my Lenore  
In the words of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe  
Now I'm sober and ""Nevermore""  
Will the Raven come to bother me at home  
  
Calling you, calling you home  
You, calling you, calling you home  
  
By the door you said you had to go  
Couldn't help me anymore  
This I saw coming, long before  
So I kept on staring out the window  
  
Calling you, calling you home  
You, calling you, calling you home  
  
I am a natural entertainer, aren't we all  
Holding pieces of dying ember  
I'm just trying to remember who I can call  
Who can I call  
  
Home, calling you, calling you  
  
I run a secret propaganda  
Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger  
I'm just trying to remember who I can call  
Can I call

It isn't, or is it a natural conception  
Torn by the arms in the opposite directions  
It isn't, or is it a Modernist reaction  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins, is it like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
Do you like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
If you change your phone number, will you tell me  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins, is it like this  
  
If you like this  
Will you remember my name  
Will you play it again, if you like this

It's the freeway  
It's just a coincidence  
When the road split, it was sudden  
Hurry me to the seventh floor, please  
The elevator is unusually small  
But no one else is here, so I feel safe  
Set me free from ""thoughtfulness""  
Oh no, everything's a parody

Don't hold it back tonight  
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you  
Put up your hands and have some fun!  
And why does  
Some wariness remain

In the asphalt, blazing a trail  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you?  
The good times are about to begin  
  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up

Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?

Compass in hand, guitar on my back  
Trying to find the  
Secret truth inside the pyramid  
  
Foxy pharaoh knows all, won't tell  
Dangerous knowledge locked in a cell  
Method in madness  
Ancient logic, never ending mystery  
  
Anticipation fills the air  
As the natives gather 'round  
Watching the fiery sun go down  
In the technicolor sky  
Exploding mandala of light  
Disappearing into darkness  
A stunning sunburst finish  
Shatters the horizon  
  
Eye of the sphinx now winks at you  
What is he thinking? wish that i knew  
Wonder of wisdom  
Far beyond this mortal comedy  
  
Wind of the desert blowing strong  
Mist of the ocean kissed by the sun  
Tropical splendor  
Paradise is calling you away  
  
Make up your mind, don't make a scene  
Wake up to find your garden is green  
Please take your seat on board  
The destination is utopia  
  
Echoing across the canyon  
Hear the song of the gypsy caravan  
Magical voices in flight  
  
Looking for the next oasis  
'Neath the glow of the silver-shadow moon  
Radiant princess of night  
  
Stay forever, stay for a while  
Hypnotized by sight and sound  
Empty feelings bring a frown  
Only love can make you smile

Try to face the fact that I ain't that young no more  
Hair's short again and a suit is in,  
  
Better brush up on how to tie a Windsor knot  
Swing to the right  
Credit's hard to find and a dollar doesn't go so far  
What's more important when the count comes in  
  
A sell-out who's alive or a corpse that can't be bought?  
Stop the hand of time  
Think I see a sign  
Tables turning 'round  
  
Hear a different sound  
Stop the hands of time  
Looking out for mine  
Swing to the right  
  
Don't want to hear what the povertous expect from me  
Let 'em eat cake if they feel that way  
I gotta work why should I have to pay for that?  
And I don't want to be left holding the bag for them  
  
'Scuze me for living but I have to say,  
I've got some worries of my own, like staying fat

In a time unique, in a place divine  
Keep your eye on the Ikon  
Shining in the light of eternal mind.  
  
I went to sleep a blind man  
But when I awoke I saw  
The legions of the lonely  
See their faces, hear them call.  
  
See how they hang on  
Each one in a world of his own design  
Listen to the Ikon  
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.  
  
And the music plays forever  
And it captures every ear  
And the sound of barriers crashing down  
Is the sweet harmony you hear.  
  
Still, be still  
To strong, so be still  
Much too long, come down  
Be still, look around  
Listen here, be still  
Hear the sound, be still.  
  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Will we sing sweet  
Sing we will  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Nil is a fear all is nil  
Still we are here we are still  
Spill it let go let it spill.  
  
The question comes to mind  
About what should be done  
And how much of the old will die  
That the new may be begun  
But you don't have to be afraid  
Of being alone with nowhere to run.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
To look yourself in the eye  
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.  
  
Someone knows who you are  
Someone watches over you  
Someone knows how you feel  
And someone feels the same.  
  
So you don't have to be afraid  
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind  
  
For those who still recoil  
For those who fear the pain  
Of peering o'er the edge of  
A new and different plane.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
Whenever you go you come back again  
So you don't have to be afraid  
We live and we die  
You don't have to be afraid to know why.

Why do I always have to take up sides  
I had no plans to be conscripted today  
I am no use to them anyway  
So what the hell's going on

Just to point a few fingers  
Fix the blame for this mess

In a stream of rhetoric

Time to go home

So they call a cease fire to bury the dead  
And just delay it for an hour or so  
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied  
What does it matter once we're vaporized

And realize everybody creates his own hell  
And if we put it together to make them all real  
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel  
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone  
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't  
Could we be suckered into thinking that  
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss  
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause

How may times would we have to go 'round  
What if tomorrow was the end of the line

Van Der Graaf Generator,Childlike Faith In Childhood's End,/v/van+der+graaf+generator/childlike+faith+in+childhoods+end_20165852.html,"Existence is a stage on which we pass  
a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:  
it's hopeless, I know,  
but onward I must go  
and try to make a start  
at seeing something more than day to day  
survival, chased by final death  
if I believed this the sum  
of the life to which we've come,  
I wouldn't waste my breath  
Somehow, there must be more. There was a time  
when more was felt than known  
but now, entrenched inside my sett,  
in light more mundane,  
thought rattles round my brain:  
we live, we die...and yet?  
  
In the beginning there was order and destiny  
but now that path has reached the border,  
and on our knees  
is no way to face the future, whatever it be.  
Though the forces which hold us in place  
last through eons in unruffled grace  
we, too, wear the face of creation.  
  
As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically  
the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,  
all space is living history.  
It seems as though time must betray us,  
yet we're alive  
and though I see no God to save us,  
yetl we survive  
through the centuries of progress  
which don't get us very far.  
All illusion! All is bogus -  
we don't yet know what we are...  
Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man!  
with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,  
we're grains of sand  
and though, in time, the sea  
may claim us for its own  
we are the rocks which root the future -  
on us it grows!  
  
We might not be there to share it  
if eternity's a jest  
but I think that I can bear it  
if the next life is the best.  
Even if there is a heaven when we die,  
endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie  
that always comes as answer to the question,  
""Why do we see through the eyes of creation?""  
  
Adrift without a course,  
it's very lonely here,  
our only conjecture  
what lies behind the dark.  
Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,  
think of a lifetime which means more  
than my own one -  
dreams of a grander thing than we are.  
Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:  
when all life is over who can say  
no mutated force shall remain?  
Though the towers of the city are denied  
to we men of clay  
still we know we shall scale  
the heights some day.  
Frightened in the silence -  
frightened, but thinking very hard,  
let us make computations of the stars.  
  
Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:  
faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:  
colour blisters, image splinters gravitate  
towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,  
The universe now beckons  
and Man, too, must take His place...  
just a few last fleeting seconds  
to wander in the waste,  
and the children who were ourselves move on,  
reincarnation stills its now perfected song,  
and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.  
  
All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies  
and slavers too,  
all the throng who have danced a merry tune -  
human we can all be,  
but Humanity we must rise above,  
in the name of all faith and hope and love.  
There's a time for all pilgrims,  
and a time for the fakers too,  
there's a time when we all will stand alone  
and nude,  
naked to the galaxies -  
naked, but clothed in the overview...  
as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew.  
  
And though dark is the highway,  
and the peak's distance breaks my heart,  
for I never shall see it, still I play my part,  
believing that what waits for us  
is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past...  
In the death of mere humans life shall start

With your infant pique and your angst pretensions  
Sometimes you act like a creep  
  
And now I'm standing in the corner  
Looking at the room and the furniture  
In cheap imitation of alienation and grief  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
Still, I reflect, this nervous wreck  
Who stands before me can see as well  
Can surely tell that he's not yet free  
He can turn aside, but can no more ignore me  
Than know which one of us is he  
Than tell what we are going to be  
Than know which one of is me  
  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
These mirror images  
These mirror images  
Won't stay, go away, are no help  
  
In these mirror images of myself  
There are no secrets

Van Der Graaf Generator,Sleepwalkers,/v/van+der+graaf+generator/sleepwalkers_20243047.html,"At night, this mindless army, ranks unbroken by dissent,  
Is moved into action and their pace does not relent.  
In step, with great precision, these dancers of the night  
Advance against the darkness - how implacable their might!  
Eyes undulled by moon, their arms and legs akimbo,  
They walk and live, hoping soon to surface from this limbo.  
Their minds, anticipating the dawn of the day,  
Shall never know what's waiting mere insight away  
Too far, too soon.  
  
Senses dimmed in semi-sentience, only wheeling through this plane,  
Only seeing fragmented images prematurely curtailed by the brain,  
But breathing, living, knowing in some measure at least  
The soul which roots the matter of both Beauty and the Beast.  
From what tooth or claw does murder spring,  
From what flesh and blood does passion?  
Both cut through the air with the pendulum's swing  
In deadly but delicate fashion.  
And every range of feeling is there in the dream  
And every logic's reeling in the force of the scream  
The senses sting.  
And though I may be dreaming and reality stalls  
I only know the meaning of sight and that's all  
And that's nothing.  
  
The columns of the night advance,  
Infectiously, their cryptic dance  
Gathers converts to the fold -  
In time the whole raw world will pace these same steps  
On into the same bitter end.  
  
Somnolent muster now the dancing dead  
Forsake the shelter of their secure beds,  
Awaken to a slumber whose depths they dread,  
As if the ground they tread would give way  
Beneath the solemn weight of their conception.  
I'd search the hidden corners of all this world,  
Make reason of the sensory whorl  
If I only had time,  
But soon the dream is ended.  
  
Tonight, before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleep  
Do you question your surrender to the drop from Lover's Leap  
Or does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own?  
Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan?  
These waking dreams of life and death  
In the mirror are twisted and buckled,  
Lashes flicker, a catch of breath,  
Skin whitening at the knuckles.  
The army of sleepwalkers shake their limbs and are loose  
And though I am a talker, I can phrase no excuse  
Not to rise again.  
In the chorus of the night-time I belong  
And I, like you, must dance to that moonlight song  
And in the end I too must pay the cost of this life.  
If all is lost none is known  
And how could we lose what we've never owned?  
Oh, I'd search out every knowledge that I could find,  
Unravel all the mysteries of mind,  
If I only had time,  
If I only had time,  
But soon my time is ended.

The love we made was not enough for you  
You're walking away from all that we dreamed of

You made you mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
You wait at the door and turn 'round to see me  
The look into your eyes says you really want to stay

They tell my heart that you can't say

Once again I've lost my way  
  
While the words of acient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has grabbed me of my vision  
Turned my heart from higher truths  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe, in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindy clutching fist of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
  
I would trade the wealth of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
Though the path of life is narrow  
But it leads the streets of gold  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe, in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth abides between us  
Come and share the truth with me  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground

Rotting castaways and broken bits of glass

And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine, Yours and mine forever

Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes, the soul never dies  
We fight, we laugh, we cry, As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down, We came around then  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now we're back on solid ground  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring, In this world of changes  
'Cause when your heart is strong  
You know you're not alone, In this world of strangers

Any night or day  
Well we'll always be

Vanilla Ice,Blowin My Mind,/v/vanilla+ice/blowin+my+mind_20143660.html,"Coolin' in the shade  
Sippin' on lemonade.  
I hear a knowck on the door who is it?  
Kim, comin' to pay me another visit.  
She tells me that I'm on her mind,  
And a player like me is very hard to find.  
I like the way she licks her lips starin' in my eyes,  
I must admit she's got some juicy thighs.  
I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit,  
That's why I got her in my mix.  
All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin',  
That's why I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Mind blowin', blowin' my mind  
  
Ten minutes past, I got my eyes on her ugh  
She's shaped like an hour glass.  
I like the red lipstick, she took a Popsicle out,  
And put it in her mouth quick.  
She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only  
A mac would like to hear.  
You see, I like a girl that really turns me on  
Twist with her walk, and sexy on the telephone.  
She tells me she dreams of me, she wants to be with me  
And not another memory,  
But for now we can hit the sheets baby,  
And keep it goin' now I'm mind blowin'.  
  
Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair,  
Now she's reaching for my underwear.  
I'm thinking I should make her wait  
For another day, oh I forget, sherri's on the way.  
Off came the top, she's looking in my eyes  
Here we go with the big surprise.  
I guess I can't resist it, hands all over my body  
As she puckered up and kissed.  
Uh, off came the pumps, I'm checkin' out the rump  
She's got a lotta junk in her trunk.  
And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin'  
Now I'm mind blowin'.

Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
I got a nation of millions to capture  
Lyrical disaster pass the ganja  
Choppin' shit like a bladerunner  
Huntin down my opponents like the predator  
Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st  
Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent  
Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin  
They're on my trail like the bone collector  
Select the sense from my sixth  
Inject the fluid of the wickedness  
Fuck the world! is my motto  
I just can't understand why they point the finger  
When they see me doing my thing  
Bitches swing when they see me pass by  
In the GS4 with the Cane plates bought from my last tour  
It's amityville horror on haters block  
For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top  
Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness

You really don't want to get into some shit that you'll regret  
Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation  
Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith  
(is it safe to come out and play now) is he gone?  
Man I don't understand what kind of high this dude is trippin on  
Pure ICE with a twist of vanilla thriller  
Captivating souls like the body snatchers  
Its return of the living Caucasians  
Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics  
Causing havoc bringing the pain  
Flaming up like in Backdraft  
Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion  
Many aren't true to what they're busting  
(from the depths)  
I'm coming through like the Hell Raiser  
It's the end of days there's no escape from the detonator

Lookin' for the right girl to be my friend  
I searched and searched but still never came up  
On the right one who would be mine and the only one  
Luck never came my way  
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see  
I couldn't stand to be alone why my boys  
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone  
Everytime I hear it rang it wasn't who I want it to be  
It was just the same ol' thing, Another day another heartache  
No pain, no gain, just Lookin' for a good thing  
Momma use to say don't look for love  
Just let it come around and surely one day it'll be found  
Ya see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
I go down, I go down, I go down baby, I go down  
I go down, I go down baby doll, I go down

Step up if ya think ya out there  
I know it's gotta be a tender  
Who'll remember Ice somewhere  
That's only if you're ready for a real one  
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one  
I want to tease and please  
And do it all with ease

There when I need ya perfect like Kodak  
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure  
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her  
The type that never says no  
Cause she's down to the fullest, Cool like the wind blows  
And I ain't trying' to search and find  
I guess it's true when they say that love is blind  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
[Verse 3]  
Now I'm on tour and got the past behind me  
But I need something to remind me  
Of the days when I played the kissing game  
But now things changed and no I ain't the same  
I made a come up, and now they run up  
They all scream I'm the one, That wants to give the love up  
But ICE ain't got no time for games  
I need a real love, Like Mary J. Blige know what I'm sayin  
But the odds are still against me, I'm making paper  
And still need that one, That wants to be with me  
And not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me  
One who can give me that security  
So if you're out there this one's for you  
You'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around

I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head  
Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead  
Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho  
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo  
I'm a Sing-Sing killer  
Gun groove captain  
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping  
Gats get brung, niggas get done  
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons  
I'm a killer

Mass murders  
Natural born killas  
I'm not fuckin around

Icky icky ya ya

OVERDUB: To die is a fate that must come to us all  
But how horrible to be buried alive  
From the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death  
Hands clawing for blood!  
Chorus--  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas  
I'm not fuckin around  
Icky icky ya ya

Yea...vanillas' stand the world on a chair, yea!  
Vanilla 'll knock 'em down on their rear, yea!  
Vanilla 'll make 'em all stand up and cheer, yea!  
He's the vanilla! break, break, break down  
[Verse 1]  
Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno  
You want to' learn my songs, this ain't no journal  
It blemished my rhyme, because I'm drawin' the line  
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine  
Just a character in a made up cartoon  
Like witchel and hazel, boy, you're pushin' a broom  
So get a new life or come equipped with the best  
Mark another one for ice, let the microphone rest  
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong  
And i'll rock it now, I need a microphone  
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance  
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance  
Because I rock with flavor, hard as lifesaver  
You asked for dope, ha...that's what I gave ya'  
A chance to go but now you move too slow  
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go  
[Chorus]  
Go...it's a party...come on...let's do this...come on..  
[Verse 2]  
Real good...into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves  
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave  
because I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved  
The only thing I need is my record revolved  
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador  
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor  
I want to' see ya' shake, shake and shiver  
You're a charity case, and ice is the giver  
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive  
You can't cope with the dop ice has concieved  
Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree  
You tried my style but I burn you see  
I'm ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold  
You want to' bite my style, you gotta' have soul  
'cause a dope like this is not easy to come by  
You don't buy it on, it comes out your hi-fi  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...'let's do this..  
[Verse 3]  
You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to mack  
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track  
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools  
You are posse's takin' a dip and vanilla's the pool  
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak  
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak  
Intruders get slayed, my pockets get paid  
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid  
See I'm the press you elect, keep the record erect  
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?  
Earthquake is on the funk, my homie's not a punk  
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk  
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit  
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit  
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up  
So make the record transform so carwin vegas  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...let's do this..  
[Outro]  
Do it! we don't need no music  
Cause all we want to' do, is sing and dance and party down  
I'm the best, he's the vanilla

It's a party...come on...let's do this..

Now I'm gonna blast you in the head  
Till you're dead with my magnum  
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp  
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it  
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking  
In my quicksand, Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman  
Got the number three in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop  
Bop bop bop  
And you fools drop, Was a big fl-fl-flop flop  
Brother's didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop  
But this ain't a dis 'cause you sold gold  
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a ten eleven million  
Given my rhyming spice while my DJ's on the slice  
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice king

I rock records, every record at random  
Flyin' heads, as the heads get full

I smash bricks with one lick

Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand  
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down

You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down  
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip

And you ain't nothing but my itty bitty target  
And as I walk through the valley of sin

And my jams break overseas (overseas)  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
'cause when the mic's turned on I get psyched up (psyched up)

Bustin' smooth moves on top of instrumental

And if you're not givin' up the credit I seek

Flowin' with the swiftness  
Kickin' it with the quickness  
Fella's gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When I'm rolllin' around in my 5.0 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
'cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin' mad 'cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I won't quit  
Ice has got it locked down and there's no stoppin' it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that I'll be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet, it could never be sour  
Here we go y'all with the

Now's the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin' up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin' all enemies, you're not even a friend of me  
I ain't Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing, G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I don't think so  
Travel state to state an' and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin' in my path an' you might get broken  
I got it goin' on an' you know I ain't jokin  
Power every hour an' the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin' out arenas so don't look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an' the place explodes  
An' if ya missed it - catch the next episode!  
Gather up your troops  
Rush 'em to the record store  
An' pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha - hit cha - hit cha

The other mc's try to duplicate  
But with the rosta man they just mediate

Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth  
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve  
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet

Well the people out there let me hear you scream  
If you want to get down and you want to be seen  
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man  
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam  
Just shake your arms and move your hips  
All you females out there let me shake your

She look so fly at the time  
I had to make up, You know, My mind  
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak  
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak  
I tryed all I could, I even said please  
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze  
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away  
I told her what was up, She said come back another day  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
The party's almost over, The club's about to close  
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose  
I'll take another chance, A try at romance  
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants  
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation  
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!  
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong  
Tyson at my back, I had to move along  
[Chorus]

Vanilla Ice,Stop That Train,/v/vanilla+ice/stop+that+train_20143689.html,"1,2,3,4  
It was an average night backstage at a show  
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!  
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet  
Her shape was so petite, and so unique  
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed  
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest  
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream  
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team  
I was one of many that she'd choose  
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse  
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on  
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm  
This was far from a story you will find in a book  
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook  
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain  
And all I kept sayin' to myself was  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Oh my God, what have I got into?  
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue  
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire  
The situation I was in could've started a campfire  
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now  
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while  
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool  
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool  
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you  
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you  
Not to mention the one who got me  
Yea, she got me, the I-see-E  
But, back to the story of a one night stand  
I thought I was strong but she was He-man  
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush  
And all 'n all it was for the lust  
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff  
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs  
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death  
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck  
And out of all nights, where was my crew?  
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do  
D already told me that the girlie was strange  
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains  
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan  
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'  
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?  
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse  
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid  
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play  
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss  
Stop this train 'cause I want to get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Later on that night as it got worse  
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst  
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame  
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train  
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun  
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run  
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come  
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb  
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?  
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist  
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor  
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore  
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body  
Why did I ever tell her to ""Pump it, Hottie?""  
What could I do to just ease the pain?  
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off

Sit back relax I'm igniting this bong  
Picture this sandy beaches dimes wearin thongs  
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long  
With me feet back puffin on my weed sack  
Shit you can't believe that people ask me  
Where you buy your trees at  
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green  
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine  
  
Like a magic carpet ride come fly with me  
And this is for my homies that get high with me  
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking  
  
Dimes rubbin on lotion  
Feet soaking in the ocean  
On a tropical Island staying sunny  
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy  
Now people say money makes the world go round  
  
So come escape with me and let's puff on a pound.  
  
Chorus:  
So high fly through the sky  
And ride my life high  
Fly through the sky  
  
  
No matter what you say  
Feeling so alright so Ire today  
Fire de go blaze  
No responsibility man  
  
No responsible  
Me I go rolling a fat blunt  
Smoking the fat blunt  
This is my goal.  
  
Take it easy Rastaman  
  
I will now go blaze  
From Kingston Jamaica  
  
Bombay to India  
Smoking in the air  
What da da da day  
Some of them are smoking  
Weed to take away frustration  
I and I do it for me aggravation  
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday  
Come me say  
Bringing it back on the boat back to the USA  
With the ganja me floating me floating away  
  
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Well it's the sticky icky bomb Holmes  
Got the fat sacks puffier than Sean Combs  
It's the Ice man back blowin dookie out the nostrils  
In the studio creating shit that's colossal  
Apostle of the green bud see me bleemed up  
In my 430 Lexus off in Texas teamed up  
With the Darkman and we're blazing  
Some headbanging shit yo the Ice'll come equipped  
  
To spit with the best cause I'm all about mine  
I got dimes of smoke that'll make you float on cloud nine  
  
Then I shine just like a beacon in the night  
Pass me the Thai I get high on the mic  
For real a zig zag story for my peeps  
Bangin in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets  
Like Napalm I'm way gone and now it's time to bounce

Dressed in silk, Latin lace and envy  
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire

Turning on the machines that neatly pump air

Shaved and hairless what once was screaming  
Now lies silent and almost sleeping

Strapped securely to the white table  
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe  
Underneath the white light  
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage  
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage  
That now  
Must be cut away  
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!  
The doctor is making his first incision  
One goes here - one goes there  
The ether tube's leaking says someone who's sloppy  
The patient it seems is not so well sleeping

Don't panic someone give him pentathol instantly

Cagily slow from the brain

All covered with sleep  
Where the black angel did weep  
Not an old city street in the east  
Gone to choose  
  
And wandering's brother  
Walked on through the night  
With his hair in his face  
On a long splintered cut from the knife of g.t.  
  
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn  
Until we said so long  
To his skull-shrill yell  
  
Shining brightly red-rimmed and  
Red-lined with the time  
Infused with the choice of the mind  
On ice skates scraping chunks  
From the bells  
  
Cut mouth bleeding razor's  
Forgetting the pain  
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye  
So you fly  
To the cozy brown snow of the east  
Gone to choose, choose again  
  
Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget  
Where you come from  
The stools of your eyes  
Serve to realize fame, choose again  
  
And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse  
For the loss of a horse  
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat  
Come again, choose to go  
  
And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame  
Have your head bobbed and weaved  
Choose a side to be on

Venom,Teacher's Pet,/v/venom/teachers+pet_20312688.html,"Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk  
She looked at me and winked her eye said ""see you after class""  
I heard the school bell ring that told me that the day was done  
She called me back and locked the door my lessons just begun  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
Sitting down she crossed her legs her skirt crept up her thigh  
Feeling something start to rise my thought began to fly  
You've been a naughty boy she said now that you can't conceal  
I'll have to punish you the best way that I feel  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
She took my hand and gently placed it in between her thighs  
With open legs and heavy breath she slowly closed her eyes  
Her flesh was aching and her hands began to stray  
On thing that I know for sure I won't forget today  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
Pulled me down forwards her mound teacher tasted sweet sixty-nine  
I don't mean lines this was teachers treat  
Played hide and seek with teachers mouth her lips were warm and wet  
Now today I've had my way and teacher won't forget

Traveling at the speed of light - saw thing never seen  
Arm in arm with Lucifer - Belial on my back  
I have swam the lake of flames - walked forbidden tracks  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
I've made love to Lilleth fair - danced the zombies dance  
I have shook the reapers hand - broke his deathly trance  
Present at ungodly births - mutants writhe in pain  
I'm possessed by Hell itself - I'm the man insane  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
Ride with me  
To Hell - and back  
You can take a trip with me - Hell's my final home  
If you wish to live at night - watch the demons room  
Holding high the Southern Cross - watch the mortals bleed  
Drink the blood and feel my wrath - watch the mutants breed  
To Hell - and back

Death defying mayhem volume  
Screaming through the stacks  
Stop and stare at the demons lair  
Burning so fast  
You won't last  
Crazed in sweat and blasphemy  
But still we cannot hear  
Legions rise, fell their eyes  
You live in fear  
You came to jeer  
Don't dicatate to us  
We were the first  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Souls of ninety thousand fold  
Are only steps away  
In the night, flames alight  
Until that day, were here to stay  
Blackened power metal marches  
Through the gates of Hades  
Weak and blind we leave behind  
Bring down the lights  
Inject the ice  
Lucifer sings 'Let it begin'

Rapid fire, from his pulsating gland

Young and horny lovers  
Back seat daddys car  
Searching through his bondage

Uncut videos, vibrating eye  
Snakes alive, cause he's never shy  
He's the voyeur  
  
Leggy traffic wardens  
Women of the law  
Coming hard on oral  
She's begging him for more  
Polaroid mistress  
Versatile and lean  
Fingering her naked flesh  
Fuel for his wet dreams  
  
He's had them all

But nobody cares
