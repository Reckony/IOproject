Cat Stevens,Sad Lisa,/c/cat+stevens/sad+lisa_20028189.html,"She hangs her head and cries on my shirt.  
She must be hurt very badly.  
Tell me what's making you sad, Li?  
Open your door, don't hide in the dark.  
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me.  
Cause you know that's how it must be.  
  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
Her eyes like windows, trickle in rain  
Upon the pain getting deeper.  
Though my love wants to relieve her.  
She walks alone from wall to wall.  
Lost in her hall, she can't hear me.  
Though I know she likes to be near me.  
  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
She sits in a corner by the door.  
There must be more I can tell her.  
If she really wants me to help her.  
I'll do what I can to show her the way.  
And maybe one day I will free her.  
Though I know no one can see her.  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

Cat Stevens,Silent Sunlight,/c/cat+stevens/silent+sunlight_20028107.html,"Silent sunlight, welcome in  
There is work I must now begin  
All my dreams have blown away  
And the children want to play  
They'll soon remember things to do  
When the heart is young  
And the night is done  
And the sky is blue  
  
Morning songbird, sing away  
Lend a tune to another day  
Bring your wings and choose a roof  
Sing a song of love and truth  
We'll soon remember if you do  
When all things were tall  
And our friends were small  
And the world was new  
  
Sleepy horses, heave away  
Put your backs to the golden hay  
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done  
For your work has just begun  
There'll be the evening in the end  
But till that time arrives  
You can rest your eyes  
And begin again

But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall.

Try to turn the world around one more time.  
Yeah, we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground

Til there's no more room up there?  
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?  
Will you tell us when to live?  
Will you tell us when to die?

What fate has denied  
All they ask is simply someone

And words that teach

Around this world

Is born to wear a smile  
And feel joyful without measure

Than somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Just a little change  
Small, to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared

Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will arise  
  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
Bittersweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong

Rising in the east

Song as old as rhyme

And I knew for sure I was loved

Why I walked away  
I know you thought you were so good to me  
I didn't see it that way  
My love's not something you can buy and sell  
Like pearls on a string  
And if you want to know where we went wrong  
You ought to stop and think  
  
Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?  
When I needed understanding were you really there?  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love?  
  
Good intentions you know I had  
Right from the start  
But if you wonder why we didn't last  
Just look inside your heart  
  
Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?  
When I needed understanding were you really there?  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love?  
  
Did you give enough time, when I was alone  
When I needed you there to make me feel I belonged  
You just don't know what you did to me  
I just had to be free  
  
Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough  
Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough

I see you touch

Empty rooms  
Crowded by the past

Days keep moving faster

An eternity  
That never heals the scars  
Of foolish pride

Missing by a mile

Why must it be like this a love without feelin'  
Something is wrong with you I know  
I see it in your eyes  
Believe me when I say  
It's gonna be Okay  
  
I told you from the start I won't be demanding  
I won't be demanding  
If you have a change of heart I'll be understanding  
I'll be understanding  
When love becomes a broken heart and dreams begin to die  
Believe me when I say  
We'll work it out some way  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
We've lost that loving touch we used to feel so much  
I try to hide the truth that's in my eyes  
The love without feeling  
But when I feel we're not in love, I know I'm losing you  
Believe when I say

Celine Dion,Love By Another Name,/c/celine+dion/love+by+another+name_20028712.html,"Somewhere past midnight  
When the moment is just right  
We ride the streets of desire  
We take it slow and  
Always get where we're goin'  
'Cause where there's smoke there's a fire  
  
There's no denying  
We don't need to keep trying  
Let's face the music and dance  
  
Well it's all semantic  
What we never say  
But what we feel ain't goin' away  
  
So I wonder, how could we be feeling  
More than this  
Tell me true  
What it is, 'cause  
  
Something has to make us feel this way  
Love by another name  
Doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love  
Won't depend upon the words we say  
Love by another name  
Something happens when we're making love  
  
Si ce n'est pas l'amour  
Qu'est-ce que c'est?  
  
We're superstitious  
When every day is like Christmas  
No promise spoken  
Hearts don't have to get broken  
More than a four letter word  
  
If we're just pretending  
We can write a new ending  
If we don't like where it leads  
  
Well it's new romantic  
Action over words  
The sweetest nothings that I've heard  
  
I can't tell you everything I'm feeling  
More than this  
Do you know  
What it is, 'cause  
  
I know that I can't describe  
What I'm feeling inside  
Maybe I'll learn  
I guess I live with the fear  
This could all disappear  
If I try to put it in words

When I heard your song  
Filled my heart with your bliss

Dizzy and Bird gave us this song  
They called it ""A Night In Tunisia""  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
It was new and very strange  
Blew the squares right off the stage  
Few could play along  
But the melody still lingers on  
  
Max and Miles to name just two  
Together they grew  
The music was young and strong  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
They paved the way for generations  
From Coltrane to Stevie  
No one could stop the winds of change  
Without them where'd we be?  
  
The Duke and the Prez were there before  
The past you can't ignore  
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame  
And the melody remains the same

Chaka Khan,High Wire - The Aerialist,/c/chaka+khan/high+wire+the+aerialist_20028851.html,"I Up on the wire  
I like to climb and play with the sky  
The people far below  
The air is clear  
And I can perceive  
The whole world is shining  
Life is sublime  
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you  
As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond  
Up high  
Just for a moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free  
  
II Fear turns to joy  
When you can race the edge of the sky  
And life's intense and strong  
It's not so long  
Before you will run  
Beyond your horizons  
Up on the wire  
The line is thin and you must bow and surf against the sky so precisely  
But the sky seems to go on as far as you can see  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As the wire disappears  
And you've finally broken free

It's a celebration, to better our relation

He had his arms around her waist

Lost your head and couldn't think

Wearing a guilty face  
Had your arms around her waist  
And lipstick on your face  
Cecil: Oh, tell me what it is

Cecil: Oh, tell me what'd you see

You're really my best friend  
Please play my favorite song for me  
Hey, mister on the radio  
You're with me every day  
  
And late at night I turn you on  
On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
It's what they're playing  
When the radio's on and you  
And me get crazy  
All of the rock and roll dj's  
Got their fingers on the world  
'cause they play the songs  
That make you and me feel so good  
Turn up your radios  
And hear the music  
  
On the radio  
This song is playin'  
When the radio's on  
And you and me get crazy  
Radio DJ monologue  
  
One minute the back side of midnight it's me captain gonzo  
Ready to roll hot wax anything you want to hear  
All night its a balmy 73 degrees in fog city,  
71 in the valley 80 in Santa Cruz, but remember if you snooze you lose  
I'm gonna hang with you, I'll crank it on  
So let me know what you want to hear phone lines are open now  
You say it you know I'm gonna play it  
And be ready to win when I tell you to call in and whatever you do  
Remember the phrase that pays puts your brain on vacation  
And let your toes take over keep your pedal to the metal  
I'll be back in sixty seconds, in the meantime go with it,  
Go for it, go nuts, go completely wild

Shoulda known- couldn't get away  
Got lucky with the girl next door  
She was lonely and didn't care  
  
She was young, she was dark, she was fair  
Wrapped herself around you with her stare  
You'd explode if she would touch you there  
Touch you there- touch you there

Honey is where I wanna be

And then my cotton gown'll come tumblin' down  
I'll make ya feel like a hell of a man  
I wanna be held tight in your arms tonight  
In my sweet old Dixie land  
Darling it seems like forever  
Does the Mississippi still run free  
I miss a little bit of Heaven  
And your southern hospitality  
  
These neon lights drive me crazy  
I wanna lay next to you and be lazy  
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms  
In the early morning Georgia air  
  
Tonight it looks like snow  
But this Gray Hound's starting to roll  
I gonna be whistelin' Dixie  
All the way back home to you

Triggers your memory

What became of all the time

Do you ever want to know  
If all dreams go on endlessly  
Or do they just run down somehow  
Gradually become the custody  
Or that melancholy jaded by the time  
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
  
Do I ever cross your mind  
When you're lonely  
Or does that only happen to me  
Darling don'tcha ever wonder

I love you better than your own kin did from the very start

I never would've wanted to walk in your shoes  
It scared me to death, I was a kid too  
Sometimes I think about you  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
Did you follow in your mama's footsteps  
Strung out on bad things  
Just a product of circumstances  
Never taught what love means  
Travis I hope you did it different this time

While we're on our way to there, why not share

Put steel to steel, and laugh at pain  
We're dreamers in castle's made of sand  
The road to Eden's overgrown

Big crowd at the crazy house  
Long cue for the joker's shoe  
Ten rounds in the ring with love  
Do you lose and win  
  
Or win and lose  
Sweet rain, like mercy in the night  
(Lay me down, wash away the sorrow)  
Caress my soul and set it right  
(Lay me down, show me your tomorrow)  
Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown

Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone  
  
Get the picture  
No room for the innocent  
Peak season in lonely town  
Knocked out of the ring by love  
Are you down and up  
  
Or up and down  
I ask the river for a sign  
(In a dream, we go on together)  
How long is love supposed to shine  
(In a dream, diamonds are forever  
But you and I, hurt together, hurt alone  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish you heart was a heart of stone

The boy who walks beside the man  
I pray that I will always have the world

The husband and the son  
That I built my life around

He'll never know it's locked in my mind  
No he'll never know  
From the feelings I show  
He'll never know  
His son is only mine  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night  
Watching darkest turn to light  
Thinking back on all the things  
I said to him today  
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say  
When the morning's almost here  
He reaches out to draw me near  
Silently I search his face for the love  
I hope to see and once again  
I'm sure that all his love belongs to me

And it ever punishes or strokes our pride.  
Never stop to think how much we lose,  
When we pick and chose in out solitude.  
  
Sothing comes up, Something goes down,  
Suddenly you feel your being pushed around,  
And just becuse you think your losin hold,  
You try to take control, the stories very old.  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll see it through  
All you gotta do is love enough  
  
Someone wants in, someone wants out  
But doesnt't't't anybody see beyond the clouds,  
Cause man you've hardly learned to speak your name  
Before your in this game  
But baby all the same  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll pull it through

We must set brand new goals  
We must not lose control  
Of the possibility of a new discovery

As crosstown traffic crawls

High up in an overpriced hotel  
The view is really swell

'Cause we're so far from home  
So this is what we do  
Sit back and let us groove  
And let us work on you  
  
We've all spent years preparing  
before this band was born  
With heaven's help it blended  
And we do thank the lord.  
  
Now we put you through the changes  
And turned around the mood  
We hope it's struck you different  
And hope you feel moved  
So forget about your troubles  
As we search for something new  
And we play for you

The chiming church bells rode the breeze

Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all

Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun

Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new

She said that she was sorry, and I really mustn't mind  
As there's lots and lots of beetles which she's certain we could find  
If we looked about the garden for the holes where beetles hid-  
And we'd get another matchbox, and write beetle on the lid.  
  
We went to all the places which a beetle might be near,  
And we made the sort of noises which a beetle likes to hear,  
And I saw a kind of something, and I gave a sort of shout:  
""A beetle-house and Alexander Beetle coming out!""  
  
It was Alexander Beetle I'm as certain as can be  
And he had a sort of look as if he thought it might be me,  
And he had a kind of look as if he thought he ought to say:

Tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

First off, baby that's loyal, most of these girls ain't royal  
And that's why you know I'm gon' spoil and I'd do anything for you  
Need your hair done, I'd fix it, want a new bag, I'd get it  
Girl you look good, let me kiss you, I wanna spend this money up with you  
Pop a couple bands for the rent, take it, that's money well spent  
That's for all the money you spent, that's for all the money you lent me girl  
Everything that I been through, I ain't 'bout act brand new  
Real friends, only got a few and real talking, baby, you the truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, if you ask me if I got you, you know what the answer is  
You know it girl  
Girl you damn right, damn right, damn right, damn right  
  
[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
I knew you had my back girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

Baby I can tell your future, drop top, girl let me scoop you (scoop you up)  
And I don't wanna ever, ever lose you, real chick, baby, I salute you

Only the homies from day one

Name saved as bae in my phone  
Give her a minute, when she come over we kissing

Pussy too good when I bang I'm on a mission  
Body to body when we changing up positions  
I'm like a prodigal, I pick her like eeny meeny miney mo  
Hop out the plane like Geronimo, I lock her down like Guantanamo  
I give that pussy a taste, put that shit all in my face

You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah  
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean  
When I tell her keep it drama free  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)  
I'm moving on to something better, better, better  
No more tryin' to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
  
Uh, use to be valentines  
Together all the time  
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie  
It's like I sent my love with a text two times  
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply  
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind  
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some  
  
'Cause when it's all said and done,  
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to  
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'  
My heart big but it beat quiet  
how never feel like we vibin'  
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence  
  
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter  
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond  
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?  
I don't wanna have to let you go  
But baby I think it's better if I let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago  
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow  
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow  
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow  
The other chick I'm with never complainin'  
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond  
  
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will  
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles  
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me  
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me  
I got a new chick, and she ain't you  
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu  
  
And all that attitude, I don't care about it  
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it  
Breezy rep two up, two down  
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

Feeling you get wetter  
We'll be making love until the morning after  
And I can feel your thigh slowly rising  
As I'm sipping from your water fountain  
  
We gon' flood the bed  
Take it to the ground  
While I'm in your ocean baby  
Hold my head down, down, down

I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it

No umbrella, playing in your rain  
Shawty, I'll be slashing in you deeper  
High draining, oh baby  
Come sit that body in my face

Your pool is like heaven on Earth  
You're screaming while I'm touching your spot  
Oh girl I got your water so high

I was at the mall on some back to school  
Tryna cop me a couple pairs of shoes  
And then I looked to my left  
And I lost my breath 'cause this girl was so fresh  
Really wasn't tryna intrude  
But she looked like the type I was into  
And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama  
Felt like a catch 22  
Okay how should I step to her, (how should I step to her)  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine)  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time (a moment of her time)  
While I was shopping I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Wishin I could catch her by herself  
Waitin til she wasn't with nobody else  
Now every time I saw her  
I was tryin to call her  
And she was busy checkin for the sales  
Part of me was like just let it go  
The other part of me was like let her know  
But I will never get this chance  
My life again gotta man up and tell her so

Baby don't you know that you  
Got me all up in the wrong store  
Now the malls bout to close  
Crazy, but I followed you  
'Cause I just couldn't take it no more  
No disrespect to your mama but I need that  
Number baby yeaa

Excuse me mamma (hey)

Acting like Sherlock Holmes or something  
They say love don't cost a thing  
But I can see change girl keep it one hunned  
If you really wanna leave  
If you really wanna go, you gotta make it through me  
I ain't doing this alone  
Think I'm going insane and it usually turns you on but right now

She don't wanna love me no more  
She said I was doing too much  
And now I'm all alone with nobody  
I might as well roll up  
I'm tired of fighting, already been down that road  
And she don't wanna love me no more  
She don't wanna love me no more

I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for momma to braid
my hair  
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight  
My momma always gave a style she knew I would like, and then  
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch  
While me and Rob played ball

Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now

When allegiance asks the questions  
Old freedom twists and turns  
And chokes on codes of honour  
On the sword of no return  
  
And it's the curse of the traveller

Got a hold of me  
And it won't let you be  
  
And in sleepless nights  
You'll call her name  
And feel loneliness cold to the bone  
And when the daylight breaks  
This old tired heart aches  
To be such a long way, such a long way from home  
  
And you long for the harbourlights  
But you'll never be free  
Of the craving for refuge  
And the call of the sea  
Always wanting to sell up  
But always needing to buy  
So till the road leads to somewhere  
And that river runs dry

It was what you saw she came to see  
Because of you she was standing there  
Giverny  
  
Books may burn and rain may fall  
But what is here I know will last forever more  
Colours change, there are no defines  
She was love itself and I thank you for giving me

Checking their final pay  
  
Those razored sabres of steel they made  
They never got to hold  
So many sold, millions  
Silence in the bar tonight  
  
And some aren't even here  
And red eyes gaze uncertainly  
Deep down into their beer  
And the Holy Ghost surrounds you with faith  
  
And peace of mind  
And love is all around you everywhere

Stick it out

You'll get by

They don't need you anymore  
You hear him shout ""bring the next one in""  
As you're walking out the door  
  
Decisions for so many dictated by so few  
A free man for the first time  
What are you gonna do now  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
We're sure if you try  
You'll get by  
Find a way

And you give me love, you're all I need  
Slowly I'm holding you closely  
  
So happy to carry you inside me  
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough  
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up

Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women  
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind  
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled  
  
When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act  
So he does what every little boy would do  
Makin' up a few false rumors or two  
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity  
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy  
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls, shout out loud  
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Nobody can hold us down  
Never can, never will  
  
So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying  
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'  
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing  
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing  
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society  
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score  
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore  
I don't understand why it's OK,  
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named  
All my ladies come together and make a change  
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Here's something I just can't understand  
If the guy have three girls then he's the man  
He can even give her some head, or sex her off  
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore  
But the tables about to turn  
I bet my fame on it  
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it  
It's aight though, you can't hold me down  
I got to keep on moving  
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac  
Do it right back to him and let that be that  
You need to let him know that his game is whack  
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back  
  
You're just a little boy  
Think you so cute, so coy  
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things  
You're just a little boy

Where do i turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm.  
I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm!

And ripped our future from my grasp,

So everything can be like our past....

Leaving presents under my tree

Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head

Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh)

Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow)

Friends come together as we decorate the tree  
This is the time of year to live in harmony  
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep  
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh  
  
This is the holiday you're with the family  
We put aside our differences and let it be  
Oh, oh how much fun it is to give and to receive  
This time of year, love is all we need, ohh

You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know  
Just how capable I am to pull through  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it

'Cause it makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now  
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame  
'Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore, no more,  
It's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it

How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through living in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You won't stop me  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I ain't goin' stop  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough

Without the sounds of bells  
Without the violins

How I feel when you hold me  
I get butterflies  
I hear lullabies  
It's hard to explain  
  
Like the scent of a rose  
Or the sound of the rain  
Is too precious and too wonderful  
To give it a name  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
It's on the tip of my tongue  
But my lips are still sealed  
Only violins  
And then innocence  
Can show you how I feel  
  
And I hear them again  
At the end of the day  
I'm all teary eyed  
When we kissed goodbye  
There's nothing I can say  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words, oh  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Must be a million times  
I tried to express this love of mine  
When it goes this deep  
When it tastes this sweet  
It's not easy to define, ohh  
  
Too beautiful for words (too beautiful)  
A symphony inside me (a symphony inside of me)  
Too beautiful for words (for words)

It wasn't long before you came on strong  
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)  
  
I played hard to get but I couldn't help  
I gave up my ironing  
You were thoughtful  
Careful not to hurt the relationship  
  
What happened to those days when  
You used to be compassionate  
Caring what I thought and said  
So attentive gentleman  
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set  
Taking me for granted lately  
Frankly, it's gotta quit

Back to the beginning, to the very beginning  
When our love was something new  
Back when romance was important  
Not just another thing to do  
  
I was feeling high on love tonight  
Thought I never come back down  
Now it seems that you and me  
Have lost our solid ground  
  
Half the time I realize  
I seem to give more than I get  
Funny how things seem to change  
After a few years commitment  
  
Used to talk for hours on end  
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed  
How I missed those days when you stayed awake  
Now you roll over and snore instead

The long for closeness  
The way you talk

I'm sorry Slim, but this is gonna hurt. They both came closer than you ever
will, jerk.

And because of you I've changed  
  
Everyone thinks I'm crazy  
For thinking that when you see me  
You're gonna love me

Please don't break my heart  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth  
Everything I'll ever need  
Spoil it now, spoil it now  
You stood up and I fell down  
  
Watching me, watching you  
I know what you wanna do  
But I'm afraid of my wish coming true  
  
So I paint a picture in my mind, that  
I go back to older times  
It's better than being with you  
  
Stay where you are  
Please don't break my heart  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth

I was lost and now I am found

The season is upon us now  
A time for gifts and giving  
And as the year draws to its close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmas time when I was young,  
The magic and the wonder,  
But colors dull and candles dim,  
And dark my standing under  
  
O little Zachary, shining light  
You've set my soul to dreaming  
You've given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A Savior King was born that day,  
A baby just like you,  
And as the Magi came with gifts,  
I come with my gift too  
  
That peace on Earth fills up your time,  
That brotherhood surrounds you.  
That you may know the warmth of love,  
And wrap it all around you  
  
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told  
From days when I was young  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone

Christmas Songs,A Christmas Carol,/c/christmas+songs/a+christmas+carol_20689791.html,"One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol.  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time.  
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends - of whom  
I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here  
Goes.  
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas,  
With it's spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in - I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street,  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial  
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.  
  
Christmas time is here, by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and don't say when  
  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother, here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you can't get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four  
  
Relations, sparing no expense, 'll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
(""Just the thing I need, how nice!"")  
  
It doesn't matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
What's important is the price  
  
Hark, the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and - buy!  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by  
  
(Spoken)  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last Christmas.  
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
""Good at any hospital for a lobotomy""... rather thoughtful.

A day that ends our woe!  
A day that tells of triumph  
Against our vanquish'd foe!  
Yield, summer's brightest sunrise,  
To this December morn:  
Life up your gates, ye Princes  
And let the Child be born!  
  
With Gloria in excelsis  
Archangels tell their mirth:  
With Kyrie eleyson  
Men answer upon the earth:  
And angels swell the triumph,  
And mortals raise the horn,  
Life up you gates, ye Princes,  
And let the Child be born.

Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
  
Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise  
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes  
I used to feel so safe inside I had a place to run and hide  
In my daddy's arms I felt secure  
No one can protect us anymore

Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer  
Oh that's what we need if we'd only believe  
It would be!

My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride

You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me

When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park  
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear  
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an illin' reindeer  
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard  
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared  
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone  
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn  
  
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause  
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""  
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's  
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease  
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right  
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night  
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree  
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me  
  
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens  
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens  
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese  
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees  
Decorate the house with lights at night  
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright  
In the fireplace is the yule log  
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog  
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's  
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carols  
  
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it  
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit  
Jack Frost chillin, the orchids out  
And that's what Christmas is all about  
The time is now, the place is here  
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer  
  
My name's D. M. C. With the mic in my hand  
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman  
So open your eyes, lend us an ear  
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,  
He was made of snow but the children  
Know how he came to life one day.  
There must have been some magic in that  
Old silk hat they found.  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.  
O, Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be,  
And the children say he could laugh  
And play just the same as you and me.

The sun was hot that day,  
So he said, ""Let's run and  
We'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away.""  
Down to the village,  
With a broomstick in his hand,  
Running here and there all  
Around the square saying,  
Catch me if you can.  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop.  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler ""Stop!""  
Mmm Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way,  
But he waved goodbye saying,  
""Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day.""

Though the frost was cruel,  
When a poor man came in sight,  
Gathering winter fuel.  
  
Hither, page, and stand by me.  
If thou know it telling:  
Yonder peasant, who is he?  
Where and what his dwelling?  
Sire, he lives a good league hence,  
Underneath the mountain,  
Right against the forest fence  
By Saint Agnes fountain.  
  
Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.  
Bring me pine logs hither.  
Thou and I will see him dine  
When we bear the thither.  
Page and monarch, forth they went,  
Forth they went together  
Through the rude wind's wild lament  
And the bitter weather.  
  
Sire, the night is darker now,  
And the wind blows stronger.  
Fails my heart, I know not how.  
I can go no longer.  
Ark my footsteps my good page,  
Tread thou in them boldly:  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage  
Freeze thy blood less coldly.  
  
In his master's step he trod,  
Where the snow lay dented.  
Heat was in the very sod  
Which the saint had printed.

Wealth or rank possessing,  
Ye who now will bless the poor

Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.  
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,  
But as for me and grandpa we believe.  
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,  
And we begged her not to go.  
But she forgot her medication, and she  
Staggered out the door into the snow.  
When we found her Christmas morning,  
At the scene of the attack,  
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,  
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.  
  
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,  
He's been taking this so well.  
See him in there watching football,  
Drinking root beer and  
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.  
It's not Christmas without Grandma,  
All the family's dressed in black  
And we just can't help but wonder:  
Should we open up her gifts,  
Or send them back?  
Send them back!!  
  
Now the goose is on the table  
And the pudding made of fig  
And the blue and silver candles  
That would just have matched  
The hair on grandma's wig.  
I've warned all my  
Friends and neighbors  
Better watch out for yourselves,  
They should never give a license  
To a man who drives a sleigh  
And plays with elves

Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents  
Think about that baby and say  
Happy birthday Jesus

But have a cup of cheer  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Ho ho the mistletoe  
Hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, by golly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas

Snowflakes drifting

Got no time for stopping  
It looks like Christmas is here.  
  
So tell me  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas

Pretty bows and ribbons

At first, I though of giving you  
A pretty diamond ring  
Wore myself out shopping  
For a million other things  
Finally decided  
On something you can't buy  
But how will I disguise it  
So you will be surprised.  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas

The world so long ago  
Laying in a manger  
He was wrapped in swadlin' clothes  
And every year we celebrate  
And thank the Lord above  
And give to one another  
Our little gifts of love.

Their old familiar carols play,  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
I thought how, as the day had come,  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head:  
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,  
""For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men. ""  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:  
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

Christmas Songs,(It Must've Been Ol') Santa Claus,/c/christmas+songs/it+mustve+been+ol+santa+claus_20674341.html,"(Lyrics by Harry Connick, Jr.)  
  
I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" because  
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends he's Santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...  
No way!  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
It must've been ol' Santa Claus  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
Happy ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' Santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said  
""Little boys like you should be in bed""  
  
So I hollered ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""  
And I put on Santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat

And oh so sad was he,  
For though he stood just 4 feet tall  
His feet were 3 feet 3.  
He tried to help make Santa's toys  
But with his feet so long,  
He'd trip and fall and break them all  
Just every thing went wrong.  
  
Now little Sandy Sleighfoot  
Don't you feel so blue:  
Even with your feet so long  
God has a place for you.  
The other kids made fun of him,  
They laughed at him with glee,  
  
But Sandy Sleighfoot learned one day  
Without skis he could ski

And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"".  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Christmas Songs,Monster's Holiday,/c/christmas+songs/monsters+holiday_20688385.html,"'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the castle  
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle  
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things  
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
But they were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monsters should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
They were making a list and checking it twice  
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike  
A new chain for Yarnush  
A brace for Igor's back  
A speed shaver for Wolfman  
A new cape for Drac  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monster's should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof  
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof  
As Santa slid down the chimney wall  
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all  
  
From beyond the moat there arose such a clatter  
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter  
Like a bolt of lightning it happened so quick  
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick  
  
He began to dig down deep in his sack  
And came up with the traction for Igor's back  
Drac got his cape  
Franky's trike made him behave  
Even Wolfman was happy now he can shave  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And all ended well  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And Santa was really swell  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
No need to rob Santa's sleigh  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Maybe next year he'll come back  
  
So the children everywhere were spared the grief  
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief  
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave  
And never again rob sleighs or graves  
  
[Repeat ""it was a monster's holiday"" in background with the following:]  
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?  
""Arrrrrr... Santa good!""  
And Santa said as he drove out of sight  
  
[Dracula accent:]  
""Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho  
Merry Christmas to all  
And to all a good night - blaaaa! ""  
  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
Where is that reindeer with the red nose, blaaaa  
On Donner, on Blitzen, on Dancer...

Rejoice that a Saviour from sin you can boast,

Burning babies, burning flags  
The hawks against the doves  
  
I took a job at the steaming way  
Down on Caltrim St  
Fell in love with a laundry girl  
That was workin' next to me  
  
Brown hair zig zagged across her face  
And a look of half surprise  
Like a fox caught in the headlights  
There was animal in her eyes  
  
She said to me  
""Can't you see I'm not the factory kind?  
If you don't take me out of here  
I'll surely lose my mind""

So fine, a breath of wind might blow her away  
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild

""So long as there's no price on love, I'll stay  
You wouldn't want me any other way""  
  
We busked around the market towns  
Fruit pickin' down in Kent  
We could tinker pots and pans  
Or knives, wherever we went  
  
We were campin' down the Gower one time  
The work was mighty good  
She wouldn't wait for the harvest  
I thought we should  
  
I said to her we'll settle down  
Get a few acres dug  
A fire burning in the hearth  
And babies on the rug  
  
She said, ""Oh man, you foolish man  
That surely sounds like hell  
You might be lord of half the world  
You'll not own me as well""

Our tempers reached a pitch  
Like a fool I let her run away  
When she took the rambling itch  
  
Last I heard she was living rough  
Back on the Derby beat  
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket  
A Wolfhound at her feet  
  
They say that she got married once  
To a man called Romany Brown  
Even a gypsy caravan  
Was too much like settlin' down  
  
They say her rose has faded  
Rough weather and hard booze  
Maybe that's the price you pay  
For the chains that you refuse  
  
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing  
I miss her more than ever, words can say  
If I could just taste all of her wildness now  
If I could hold her in my arms today

Not knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty,  
For men like me that hadn't got a penny to their name.  
So he locked my leg to 35 pounds of Black Jack County  
Chains.  
  
And all we had to eat was bread and water,  
Each day we built the road a mile and a quarter,  
A Black Snake Whip would cut the back of any man who complained,  
But we couldn't fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black  
Jack County Chains.  
  
One night while the Sheriff he was sleeping,  
We all gathered round him slowly creeping,  
Heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain,  
When we beat him to death with 35 pounds of Black Jack  
County Chains.  
  
Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful,  
There's nothing left but a scar around my ankle.  
But most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again,  
To a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County

Christy Moore,Bridget's Pill,/c/christy+moore/bridgets+pill_21007172.html,"Bridget O'Reilly was a fine looking girl  
Well, her skin was like ivory and her teeth shone like  
Pearls  
The fellas all chased her in vain til one day  
She went and got married to Barney O'Shea  
  
They'd been married a year, when to their pride and joy  
Along came a baby, a fine strapping boy  
When three years had past, they'd two boys and a girl  
How to feed them and clothe them made Bridget's head  
Whirl  
  
Bridget went to the priest, she was near desperation  
Because of this process of constant gestation  
O Father, this business is making me I'll  
Would it be a sin if I took to the Pill?  
  
The priest heard her story and when he had heard it  
To higher authorities, perplexed, he referred it  
The bishops were baffled, the cardinals too  
Not one could tell Bridget just what she should do  
  
Two years they debated with holy profundity  
What should be done about Bridget's fecundity  
For now Bridget's children amounted to five  
And she scarcely was able to keep them alive  
  
They gave due attention to points theological  
Points philosophic and physiological  
Til in desperation, the Pope cried, o sod  
There's just one thing to do, I'd best go and ask God  
  
So the Pope sent a letter by five penny post  
On Papal notepaper, addressed, Holy Ghost  
Come send me an answer in double quick time  
  
You can reach me at home, just ring vat 69  
  
The Pope got his answer and then he announced it  
Oral contraception, he thoroughly denounced it  
All chemical means to prevent procreation  
Are banned on the pain or eternal damnation  
  
If we were to allow it, unashamed fornication  
Would spread like a flash to all parts of the nation  
There'd be plagues, fire, and famine and moral  
Pollution  
Atheistical notions and red revolution  
  
And the Lord knows what women would do with their lives  
If they weren't kept so busy as mothers and wives  
They might get ideas not befitting their station  
And wind up in women's or gay liberation  
  
So Bridget, my dear, there's no need for frustration  
Because of the banning of this medication  
The Church, she is merciful, holy, and gracious  
Surely the old rhythm method you'll find efficacious  
  
Away now, said Bridget, I'll have none of your row  
For I tried it before and just look at me now  
Whatever I did, we continued to breed  
And she's off to the chemists with maximum speed  
  
Now the Church is in ferment, in great trepidation  
Lest such thought should spread to the whole  
Congregation  
And they've issued a record to prevent a schism  
By the Pope and the Hierarchy, called, I've got rhythm

On the journey of a lifetime, and the crack was ninety-one  
Joxer met a German's daughter on the banks of the river Rhine  
And he told her she'd be welcome in Ballyfermot any time.  
  
As soon as we found Stuttgart we got the wagons in a ring  
Sean Og got out the banjo and Peter played the mandolin  
There was fans there from everywhere attracted by the sound  
At the first Fleadh Ceoil in Europe, and Joxer passed the flagon round.  
  
But the session it ended when we'd finished all the stout  
The air mattresses inflated and the sleeping bags rolled out  
As one by one we fell asleep Joxer had a dream  
He dreamt himself and Jack Charlton sat down to pick the team.  
  
Joxer dreamt they both agreed on Packie Bonner straightaway  
And that Moran, Whelan and McGrath were certainly to play  
But tempers they began to rise and patience wearing thin  
Jack wanted Cascarino but Joxer wanted Quinn.  
  
The dream turned into a nightmare, Joxer stuck the head on Jack  
Who wanted to bring Johnny Giles and Eamon Dunphy back  
The cock crew in the morning, it crew both loud and shrill  
Joxer woke up in his sleeping bag many miles from Arbour Hill.  
  
The next morning none of the experts gave us the slightest chance  
They said the English team would lead us on a merry dance  
With their Union Jacks all them English fans for victory they were set  
Until Ray Houghton got the ball and he stuck it in the net.  
  
What happened next is history, brought tears to many eyes  
That day will be the highlight of many people's lives  
Joxer climbed right over the top and the last time he was seen  
Was arm in arm with Jack Charlton singing, Revenge for Skibereen.  
  
Now Whacker's back in Inchicore, he's living with his mam  
And Jack Charlton has been proclaimed an honorary Irishman  
Do you remember that German's daughter on the banks of the river Rhine  
Well, didn't she show up in Ballyfermot last week and...

Christy Moore,Lakes Of Pontchartrain,/c/christy+moore/lakes+of+pontchartrain_20236260.html,"It was one fine March morning, I bid New Orleans Adieu  
And I took the road to Jackson Town, my fortune to renew  
I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain  
Which filled my heart with a longing for, the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun  
I rode the rods till evening and I laid me down again  
All strangers there no friends to me 'til a dark girl towards me came  
And I fell in love with the Creole Girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I said ""Me pretty Creole Girl, me money here's no good,  
If it weren't for the alligators, I'd sleep out there in the wood""  
""You're welcome here kind stranger, Our house is very plain""  
""But we never turned a stranger out, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain""  
  
She took me into her mammy's house and treated me right well  
The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell  
To try and paint here beauty, I'm sure 'twould be in vain  
So handsome was my Creole girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I asked her if she'd marry me, she said that ne'er could be  
For she had got a lover and he was far at sea  
She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain  
Till he'd return to his Creole girl, on the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
It's fare thee well, me Creole girl, I'll never see you more  
I'll never forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore  
And at each social gathering, a flowing bowl I'll drain  
And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain

Christy Moore,Lawless,/c/christy+moore/lawless_20957647.html,"He was Lawless by name, Lawless by nature,  
He was trouble right from the start.  
Hard as nails, runnin' wild through the streets  
He was breakin' his poor mother's heart.  
Nature played a trick on Lawless  
And the humour of nature is cruel.  
He grew up as we all had expected -  
Into a dangerous fool.  
  
He was a hard man, a man for all seasons,  
He was always out for a fight.  
He couldn't hold drink but still he'd get plastered  
In Clark's every Saturday night,  
Strip to the vest and challenge the best  
Until the guards they were called to come fast,  
And they'd lock him away for the rest of the day  
And let him out on the Sunday for mass.  
  
Oh one night he went down  
To the Ring's End Regatta  
Where he met up with the (bold?) Dolly (Platts?)  
She wasn't exactly what you'd call beauty,  
But she was the belle of our flats.  
A whirlwind romance and Dolly took a (flier?)  
With Lawless she would settle down  
It was pure coincidence three months before  
There was a yankee destroyer in town.  
  
And the couple were blessed with one of god's miracles  
Before six months had elapsed  
Dolly gave birth to a nine-pound black baby  
And Lawless was fit to collapse  
She swore she'd never been touched by another  
And Lawless took her at her word,  
And the neighbours exclaimed, 'he's the spit of his  
Father, and the cuckoo is a wonderful bird. '  
  
Oh now Lawless stays in and looks after his baby  
While Dolly goes out for the night.  
The old gossips all say she's free in her ways  
And their evil rumours ran rife.  
When Lawless heard this he waited for Dolly  
In the bridge where the river runs low.  
Noone will ever know what happened next,  
But Dolly drowned in the Dodder  
Below.  
  
Some say he's crazy and more say he's evil,  
Everyone says that he's mad.  
Noone will defend him, he was no angel,  
But I'll tell you he wasn't all bad.  
They've locked him away for the rest of his natural  
Never again will he see  
Down the back of Ring's End  
There's a lonely child playing  
Where the Liffey flows into the sea.

Barney Rush was home and we organised a sing-song in  
The brought Mick Curry who sang this  
Song. He is a great song had a great night.  
Frank harte was there too.

Good for nothing but stacking a brick  
Your best mate's a spade and he carries a hod  
Two work horses heavily shod

Who did you murder, are you a spy?  
I'm just fond of a drink helps me laugh, helps me cry  
So I just drink red biddy for a permanent high  
I laugh a lot less and I'll cry till I die  
  
All ye young people now take my advice  
Before crossing the ocean you'd better think twice  
Cause you can't live without love, without love alone  
The proof is round London in the nobody zone  
  
Where the summer is fine, but the winter's a fridge  
Wrapped up in old cardboard under Charing Cross Bridge  
And I'll never go home now because of the shame  
Of misfit's reflection in a shop window pane

Voices in anger, victims of history  
Plundered and set aside, grow fat on swallowed pride  
  
With promises of paradise and gifts of beads and knives  
Missionaries and pioneers are soldiers in disguise  
Saviours and conquerors, they make us wait  
Like fishers of men they wave their truth like bait  
But with the touch of a stranger's hand innocence turns to shame  
The spirit that dwelt within now sleeps out in the rain  
  
For all of our languages we can't communicate,  
For all of our native tongues, we're all natives here  
The scars of the past are slow to disappear  
The cries of the dead are always in our ears  
And only the very safe can talk about wrong and right

With their bellies in the water.  
On a single day in County Galway,  
The great majority of the poor located there  
  
Were in a state of starvation,  
Many hourly expecting death to relieve their suffering.  
  
On a single day,  
The Lady Mayoress held a ball  
At the Mansion House in Dublin  
In the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  
Dancing continued until the early hours,  
And refreshments of the most varied and sumptuous  
Nature  
Were supplied with inexhaustible profusion.

A land that has never known freedom  
And only her rivers run free

Than to live in the cold chains of bondage  
To bring back their rights were denied

How mellow the wine but it's dry  
How fragrant the rose but it's dying

By Christy Moore  
  
As I was walking home one evenin'  
I know this takes some believin'  
I met a group of creatures  
With the strangest lookin' features  
  
A poor old dove and a worm in the weed  
And a fine old pigeon, yes indeed  
A daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
And the daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
  
On his thin and wispy spindles  
He was deft and he was nimble  
His eyes were scientific  
And his dancing was terrific  
  
And the rats and worms they made a din  
And the nettles in the corners took it in  
""Oh God"" says I, ""Tonight's the night""  
""We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light""  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
""Oh God"" says I ""tonight's the night  
We'll dance to the reel in the flickering light""  
  
Then he looked at me directly  
With a gaze that could dissect me  
Then he asked me in a whisper  
""Have you got any sisters?""  
  
""Oh God almighty"" says I to him  
""What sort of a man d'you think I am?  
I've only one she's not your type  
She wouldn't dance the reel in the flickering light""  
So round we go, heel to the toe  
""I've only one she's not your type  
She wouldn't dance a reel in the flickering light""  
  
Says he:  
""Does she come from another planet?  
Does she got a bee in her bonnet?  
Does she do her daily duties  
You never know we might be suited""  
  
And the rats and the worms began in to laugh  
And some of them started shufflin' off  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
  
I could see he had no scruples  
When I looked into his pupils  
They were purple or magenta  
Like a statue during lent  
  
I said ""I'll get her right away""  
""Good man"" says he ""now don't delay""  
We're going to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light.  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
We're goin' to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light.  
  
Then up stepped a red carnation  
and they gave her an ovation  
She was warm and enchatin'  
As she slowly started dancin'  
  
And the wise old pigeon peeled his eye.  
And the nettles and the weeds began to sigh.  
Daddy longlegs said ""my-oh-my  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light? ""  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
Daddy longlegs said ""my-oh-my  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light? ""  
  
She was gentle, she was charmin'  
And I heard him call her ""darlin'  
He was graceful as a whisper  
On his delicate legs of silver  
  
And the rats and worms were still as mice  
And the poor old pigeon said ""That's nice""  
As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go, heel to the toe  
As shimmering there, ah, the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light

Dia le hEireann, suckle the empire  
Dia le hEireann, suffer the loss  
Of the green to the blue while the media feeds  
On the blood and the pain and the hatred  
Father walks home on the colourless night  
And the organisation has blinded his sight  
His wife and his kids are sleeping tonight  
In the arms of sweet Jesus and Mary

The nightingale sings her best

And the girl i love wore a muslin dress  
The fisherman dream of the sun in the west  
And so do I  
And so do I  
Now i can see  
Since the girl i love dearly  
Has cast her loving spell on me  
Thiis is the day the cuckoo likes  
And so do I  
When the hills fall down in different shapes  
And the swallows fly  
To a hidden beach where boats can't go  
Mountain rivers overflow  
I hear the squelin' of the seagulls  
As off home they go  
And so do I  
And so do I  
Now i can see  
Since the girl i love dearly  
Has cast her loving spell on me  
I'll cross the seven oceans  
Forever more i'll wander  
Till she has cast her loving spell on me

Someone to call me his own,  
Someone to sleep with me nightly,  
I weary of sleeping alone.  
Meet me tonight in the moonlight,  
Meet me tonight all alone,  
I have a sad story to tell you  
I'm telling it under the moon.  
Tonight is our last night together,  
Nearest and dearest must part,  
The love that has bound us together  
Is shredded and torn apart.  
I wish I had ships on the ocean  
Lined with silver and gold  
Follow the ship that he sails in  
A lad of 19 years-old.  
I wish I had wings of a swallow,  
Fly out over the sea  
Fly to the arms of my true love  
And bring him home safely to me.

And say for you that the sun don't shine  
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags  
Shes no time for talking she just keeps right on walking  
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

Same old man sitting there on his own  
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup  
Each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone

Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears  
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity  
For one more forgotton hero and a world that doesnt't't't care

Crossed over the bridge and down by the river  
By the strawberry beds I found that I knew her  
She called me her darling man  
We spend a few hours and we drank a few glasses  
We danced at the bar ignoring their glances  
Ev'ryone knew her name and they knew by my face  
With a beer in my hand and her arm round my waist  
Calling me her darling man

Then came the morning and my boat was leaving  
She smiled as she said to me: ""No point in grieving""

I remember her smile and I hear her voice saying:

All our thought turn to love as the day it draws near,  
When sweethearts and darlings, husbands and wives,  
Pledge love and devotion for the rest of their lives.  
As day turns to evening soon nighttime does fall,  
Young people preparing for the Valentine's Ball,  
As the night rings with laughter some people still  
Mourn  
The 48 children who never came home.  
  
Chorus  
  
Have we forgotten the suffering and pain  
The survivors and victims of the fire in Artane,  
The mothers and fathers forever to mourn  
The 48 children who never came home.  
  
Down to the Stardust they all made their way  
The bouncers stood back as they lined up to pay  
The records are spinning there's dancing as well  
Just how the fire started sure no one can tell.  
In a matter of seconds confusion did reign  
The room was in darkness fire exits were chained  
The firefighters wept for they could not hide,  
  
Their anger and sorrow for those left inside.  
  
Chorus  
  
All around the city the bad news it spread  
There's a fire in the Stardust there's 48 dead  
Hundreds of children are injured and maimed  
And all just because the fire exits were chained.  
Our leaders were shocked, grim statements were made  
They she'd tears in the graveyard as the bodies were  
Laid  
The victims have waited in vain for 4 years  
It seems like our leaders she'd crocodile tears.  
  
Chorus  
  
Half a million was spent on solicitor's fees,  
A fortune to the owner and his family  
It's hard to believe not one penny came  
To the working class people who suffered the pain.  
Days turn to weeks and weeks turn to years  
Our laws favour the rich or so it appears  
A woman still waits for her lads to come home  
Injustice breeds anger and that's what's been done.

Chuck Berry,Back To Memphis,/c/chuck+berry/back+to+memphis_20152178.html,"I've been struggling up here, child, trying to make a living  
Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving  
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama  
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas  
No brotherly love, no help, no danger  
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers  
I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better  
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter  
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama  
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas  
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to  
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner  
I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station  
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation  
I'm going back to Memphis, back home with my Mama  
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas  
Back home in Memphis, no moaning and groaning  
I know everything will be all right in the morning

Had drank so much he could drink no more,  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train.  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp,  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer,  
The passengers were most a motley crew,  
Some were foreigners and others he knew.  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags.  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face,  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew,  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed,  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain.  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home,  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train.  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high,  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before.  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train.

But when I'm gloomy just listen to me until it's all talked away

Chuck Berry,Promised Land,/c/chuck+berry/promised+land_20030905.html,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia,  
California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh,  
On across Caroline.  
  
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,  
And we never was a minute late.  
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,  
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.  
  
We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,  
Half way 'cross Alabam,  
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded  
In downtown Birmingham.  
  
Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,  
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean  
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham  
Smoking into New Orleans.  
  
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana  
Just help me get to Houston town.  
There's people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let the poor boy down.  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,  
Put luggage in my hands,  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque  
On a jet to the promised land.  
  
Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte  
Flying over to the Golden State,  
The pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.  
  
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy  
Taxi to the terminal zone,  
Cut your engines, cool your wings,  
And let me make it to the telephone.  
  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,  
Tidewater four ten O nine  
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'  
And the poor boy's on the line.

He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war  
Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true  
She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you  
  
While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show  
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe  
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield
into  
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you  
  
Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone  
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone  
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous  
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you  
  
Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea  
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free  
It was a group in automation getting together two by two  
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you  
  
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school  
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule  
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do  
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you  
  
And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone  
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun  
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true  
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you  
  
The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd
shun  
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son  
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through  
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you  
  
Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you  
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through  
Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue  
I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

I often think of when I met you  
Many times we kissed goodbye  
Sometimes I dream we are together  
Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes  
And I wanna scream that I still love you  
But you're not there, I got to realize  
  
It is now High Noon in China  
With the same stars up above  
The one I need has left me and gone now  
And all I have is a little picutre of  
The truest one I've ever known now  
Is the love I lost and still I love

The rat that spread the cancer  
  
And the lies they've been spinnin'  
And the smiles they've been grinnin'  
There has sure been some sinnin'  
But nobody's winnin'

And nobody wants you when you're down

Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get blood from a stone  
You can't get blood from a stone

But my train's gone off the tracks  
and my wheels are spinnin'  
And I'm a walkin'  
Down a one way dirty street

From the love they've been buyin'  
And the blues they've been cryin'  
Now the time keeps a flyin'  
But nobody's tryin'  
Cause the love of the money  
Didn't turn out so sunny  
When the well's dry

Cinderella,Cinderella,/c/cinderella/cinderella_20640742.html,"When I was just a little girl  
My momma used to tuck me into bed  
And she'd read me a story  
It always was about a princess in distress  
And how a guy would save her and end up with the glory  
I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be  
Then one day I realized the fairy tale life wasn't for me  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
Don't want to depend on no-one else  
I'd rather rescue myself  
  
Someday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart, and mind  
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me  
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am  
Don't need nobody taking care of me  
I will be there for him just as strong as he, will be there for me  
When I give myself then it has got to be, an equal thing  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar

I can dream, my own dreams  
My knight in shining armour is me  
So I'm gonna set me free

The room had no ceiling or floor.  
Ten minutes ago I met you  
And we murmured our how-do-you-do's.  
I wanted to ring out the bells  
And fling out my arms  
And to sing out the news.  
  
I have found her, she's an angel  
With the dust of the stars in her eyes.  
We are dancing, We are flying,  
And she's bringing me back to the skies.  
In the wings of my love I'm flying  
Over mountain and meadow and glen.  
And I like it so well  
That for all I can tell  
I may never come down again.  
I may never come down to earth again.
