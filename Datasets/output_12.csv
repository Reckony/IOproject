Kris Kristofferson,The Show Goes On,/k/kris+kristofferson/the+show+goes+on_20494866.html,"We used to talk about the rock and the roll  
That made it matter not to sell your soul  
Like a banner that we held so high, we weren't afraid to fall  
Steady rolling through the warning signs  
That were hidden in between the lines  
That kept us rocking till the break of day  
Or any break at all  
  
We used to take about a day and a night  
To try to sing up all the soul in sight  
And anyone who couldn't see the light  
We had to leave behind  
And the sweetest thing you ever heard  
Was the singing of the speckled bird  
And commercial was a dirty word  
We laid it on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
It was all so easy then  
We could do no wrong  
We'll never be the same again  
But the show goes on  
  
We used to drink about a bucket of booze  
To try to chase away the black and blues  
And when it came the time to pay your dues  
You gave an I.O.U.  
To the devil with the dirty smile  
Which he added to the growing pile  
Of the promises you mean to keep  
The day your dreams come true  
  
[Chorus]

Life is a promise nobody keeps, lay yourself down girl, rock me to sleep  
  
We were the wild ones, proud in our prime, me and the stallion Lord, one of a
kind  
See how we run Lord, see how we fall, ridin' for moonlight we done it all  
Well the daylight was dyin' rooks in the wind, she stood before me, stripped
to the skin  
  
Next to my stallion she purely shown, glidin' the moonlight, starlight and
stone  
The moonlight is silver, starlight is cold waking to laughter, shaking my soul  
She was running my stallion, naked and free, ridin' for moonlight, gone like
the dream  
  
So stay if you want to, don't be ashamed, leavin' is easy Lord, losin's the
same  
Life is a promise nobody keeps, lay yourself down girl, rock me to sleep

Kris Kristofferson,The Stranger I Love,/k/kris+kristofferson/the+stranger+i+love_20080558.html,"I've been a simple man and I've been insane  
And I've been a vagabond and I've been a king, yeah  
But I've been a better man just tryin' to please the stranger I love  
  
Lost in a wilderness, darker than pain, drawn to her loneliness just like a
flame  
The closer we come the more that I learn, the stranger I love  
Bad as I loved her, I ain't afraid we'll be together some lovin' way  
  
I'll be her lover just as long as I can, then when it's over, she'll need a
friend  
So I'll take her hand-me-downs, I'll take the blame  
I'll be a hang-around, I ain't ashamed  
'Cause the longer I love her, the more I believe the stranger I love.

To open the doors that she can't on her own  
He's a lover, he'll love her  
In ways that she never has been loved before  
And he's a getter, he'll get her  
By gettin her into the world she's been hungerin' for  
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her  
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to  
He'll take his time before takin' advantage  
Takin' her easy and slow  
And after he's taken the body and soul  
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted  
Then he'll take off and leave her  
Takin' all of her pride as he goes  
Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...  
He's a charmer, and he'll charm her  
With money and manners that I never learned  
He's a leader, and he'll lead her  
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn  
He's a talker, he'll talk her  
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long  
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her  
The way that I never  
And damned if he won't do her wrong  
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her  
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to  
He'll take his time before takin' advantage  
Takin' her easy and slow

God's still up there laughin', so she's gotta be alive  
Who says he can't take a dirty joke  
  
Power isn't power does and power slips away, it's so easy to abuse  
Who'd've thought them Arabs would've brought the USA just to give it to the
Jews  
Singing crime still don't pay just like it used to  
And you know this time slips away 'til you die  
  
Well I don't give a damn when I choose to, no it don't hurt so bad when you're
high  
Oh say, does the future of the homesick and the brave even matter anymore  
There ain't no more reason for them boys to run away than there was to fight
before  
Would you tell me why the hell we'd try  
To win back in a war what we lost in the last  
  
Might just ain't as righteous as it used to be, before when your army's out of
gas  
Singing crime still don't pay...  
Singing crime still don't pay...

Kris Kristofferson,They Killed Him,/k/kris+kristofferson/they+killed+him_20080528.html,"There was a man named mahatma Gandhi

And nothing wrong could make it right away  
But he knew his duty, and the price he had to pay  
Just another holy man who tried to make a stand  
My god, they killed him !  
Another man from atlanta, georgia  
By the name of martin luther king  
He shook the land like rolling thunder  
And made the bells of freedom ring today  
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away  
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend  
My god, they killed him !  
The only son of God almighty  
The holy one called jesus christ  
Healed the lame and fed the hungry  
And for his love they took his life away  
On the road to glory where the story never ends  
Just the holy son of man we'll never understand  
My god, they killed him !  
Sing about mahatma Gandhi  
Sing of martin luther king  
Sing of jesus christ almighty  
And the brothers kennedy

And they call it communism because they don't know what it means

And the rich keep getting richer and as wrong as they are right  
And the poor become the victims of the armies of the night  
And the odds are never even and their skins are never white

Broken rules and dirty warriors spreading lies and secret funds  
Can't defeat the campesino with their money and their guns

Some are coming true  
Nothing's simple as it seems  
  
But I guess you count your blessings with the problems  
That you're dealing with today  
Like the changing of the seasons  
Ain't you come a long way (Ain't you come a long way)  
Ain't you come a long way down  
This old road  
  
Looking at a looking glass  
Running out of time  
On a face you used to know  
Traces of a future lost  
In between the lines  
One more rainbow for the road  
  
Thinking of the faces in the windows  
That you passed along the way  
Or the last thing you believed in  
Ain't you come long way (Ain't you come a long way)  
Ain't you come a long way down  
This old road  
  
Say you tried to chase the sun down  
And you let it slip away  
And the holy night is falling  
Ain't you come long way (Ain't you come a long way)  
Ain't you come a long way down

Gone to hell under the gun  
See the child, young and hungry  
Growing wild, on the run  
And he'll die reaching for freedom  
He was born under the gun  
Swollen men, blind with power  
Break the rules, one by one  
With their lies raising the danger  
Of their games under the gun.  
No more time, no more chances  
No more wars will be won  
In the end only the losers  
Hold the land under the gun  
Hold the truth like a candle  
Let it shine like the sun  
On the love that's left to believe in  
In a world under the gun.

Kung iba ang napili  
Buti ay dumating ka, dahil kung hindi

Ang ligaya kong nadarama, muntik nang hindi mapasa 'kin sinta  
Ang init ng 'yong yakap, sa twing kapiling ka  
Pag-ibig mong tunay sa iba'why di nakikita  
Buti na lang ikaw ang nakasama sa buhay, 'di mawawalay sa 'yo?  
Sa 'kin kay raming nagsabing sila ang piliin  
Ngunit karamiha'why bitin  
Di ko makita sa kanila ang aking hinahanap  
Parang laging kulang  
REPEAT PRE-CHORUS AND CHORUS  
BRIDGE:  
Ikaw na nga  
Wala na ngang iba 'kong nakikitang ipapalit pa  
Pagka't ikaw lamang sa akin  
Ang nagbigay ng tunay na ligaya  
O aking sinta

You said You'd never leave me,  
I let go of Your hand  
Built my castle in the sand  
But I'm reaching out again  
And I'm not letting go 'til You  
Hold me, mold me  
Sometimes I feel so all alone,  
See I gotta find my way back home  
So why don't You  
Shape me, make me,  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I gotta find my way back home.  
  
Master, upon my knees I pray  
I just wanna be the clay  
Put Your arms around me,  
Place my life in Your hands  
Lord, I know I'm just a man  
Hope You understand  
This time I'm not letting go til You  
Anoint me, appoint me  
Sometimes I feel so all alone,  
I'm on my way back home  
So why don't You  
Chastise me, baptize me,  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I gotta find my way.  
  
Cause I'm lost and alone  
I've been wandering long enough to know  
Humbly I search for You  
And I'm not gonna rest til You  
Choose me, use me

'bout the days when we were wishing  
We could fly and touch the sky  
  
Laughing meeting under cover  
Running hiding from your mother  
If we tried we could do anything  
  
And when the DJ came to town  
People came from all around  
Baby l still recall those things  
And ooh, I'm missing you now  
I'm missing you now  
  
And you turned my world around  
When you burned this disco down  
Why'd you leave to find yourself  
I can't dance with no-one else  
And still there's memories of this town  
When you burned this disco down  
  
It's been ten years now this Sunday  
Since you left or was it Monday  
Time can fly when you're still in love  
  
And now I boogie in my dreams  
To ole freak or dancing queen  
Baby I still recall those things  
And ooh, I'm missing you now  
I'm missing you now  
  
And you turned my world around  
When you burned this disco down  
Why'd you leave to find yourself

And oh, now the dance has died for sure  
Since your love ain't here no more  
Still l wonder where you are  
I'll always wonder where you are

When you burned this disco down  
Why'd you leave to find yourself

To wake with the moon and sleep with the sun  
To be a sinner, a saint, a lover, a friend  
To know a beginning but never and end  
To fly in the ocean and swim in the skies  
Believer in truth, defendant of lies  
To know the purest love, the deepest pain  
To be lost and found again, and again, and again  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
To know the power of wealth and poverty  
To taste every moment and try everything  
To be hailed a hero, branded a fool  
Believe in the sacred and break every rule  
To give into pleasure with no boundaries  
Living in chaos and harmony  
To feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress  
To know the limit of torture and tenderness  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling keep believing in dreams

Feels like we've been apart for some light years  
Crater in my heart, filled with my tears  
Stars align, I'll be your girl again  
What I'm tryin say, I want you back in my world again  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
And I bet you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact

Voice in my head asking why me?  
I'm here wishing you would stop by my place  
But the only time we talk is on Myspace  
By the way, have you found my replacement?  
She should be the one on this spaceship  
Waking up, reaching for you when you're not there  
You got me in another galaxy, I'm out there

When we kicked it everyday

Put me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again  
Beguiled again  
A simpering whimpering child again  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Lost my heart but what of it  
He is cold I agree  
He can laugh but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to him each spring to him  
And long for the day when I'll cling to him  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Men are not a new sensation  
I've done pretty well I think  
But this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I've sinned a lot  
I'm mean a lot  
But now I'm like seventeen a lot  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Years ago we met by chance  
Thinking - we? D start the greatest love of all

Together we have been so strong  
Through the years I felt a change  
Suspecting? We could not keep our love alive  
Soon it all  
Became so strange

You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
  
Verse 2:  
I shy away from love these days  
  
Because? I need to be alone for now  
We have to go different ways  
Then I may understand my faults  
I? M sure that it will take some time  
Until? I open up my heart again  
It? S so dark  
The sun won? T shine

But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow

And follow your track

Another way out, another way out...  
The army ants have escaped.

Gasoline and a pistol, blood filling the bathtub.

I am wild child, sky high,  
Lying on your floor,  
I know I had a lot,  
But baby wants a little more,  
Dum dum.  
  
In my white mint pink cigarettes  
From the store, we'll make margaritas,  
You wanna take a shot? Dum Dum.  
  
I belong to a bygone era,  
Like the bugs in the long tipsy hair,  
Cuz I am on the scene,  
Yeah I am on the scene.  
  
I am a bad jazz singer,  
Living in the finger,  
No matter what you linger,  
Cuz you like me even when I am mean,  
I am the Queen.

Adam lives in theory  
Trying to turn stone into bread  
Masquerading like he got it figured out  
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head  
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt  
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices  
Praying to the alter of himself  
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious  
Like he's got all the light, and no one else  
He takes the unsuspected  
'cause he knows they're not connected  
And he shows them how to be just as he is  
Virtually real, and commercially appealed  
To the lust of all the people where he lives  
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed  
Wanting to be intellectual  
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day  
And now she thinks that she's bisexual  
Caught up in emotion  
Burning up in her devotion  
To the king of exploitaion in the field  
She handed him her virtue  
'cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""  
So she lay with him to see how good it feels  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication  
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying  
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head  
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment  
'cause everything appears to be the same  
They entertain suggestion,  
Next time just use protection  
Desiring to cover up their shame  
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes  
To the very antidote to their dilemma  
Burning in their lust,  
Both of them were dealt to us  
Destroying the original agenda  
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie  
They exhausted every possible conclusion,  
They can't even entertain the solution,  
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution  
Hiding from the truth,  
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation  
When confronted, blamed his wife  
Giving birth to carnal life  
Refusing to acknowledge what he done  
Now if we can agree with who created us to be  
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes  
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception  
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified  
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you  
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,  
To this decaying social system  
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go  
If we love him like we say we do,  
He will try us  
Just don't regress,  
Or slip into hopelessness  
Once he's satisfied his love,  
He won't deny us,  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

And let me love you, baby  
Let me love you  
  
You're just too good to be true  
I can't take my eyes off you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I wanna hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off You  
  
I need you baby  
And if it's quite all right  
I need you baby  
To warm the lonely nights  
I love you baby  
Now trust in me when I say it's okay  
  
Oh pretty baby  
Don't let me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby  
Now that I've found you stay  
And let me love you, baby

Flipped the beat, move the sheep, like the shepherd  
It's a new day, my crew stay forever strivin'  
Give thanks 'cause we alive and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
  
It's clear to me now  
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how  
Now we movin' planets, take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged  
  
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done  
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one  
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision  
Not accidental, intentional, conscious decision  
  
To Zion, we're marchin' through with African Mayans  
Conquerin' Babylon with the heart of a lion  
Behold and watch yesterday come back around  
And the walls of Jericho come a tumblin' down  
  
Tell me, how long has it been  
Is everything, everything alright my friend  
You see, time is passin'  
People askin' how come none of this ain't lastin'  
  
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel  
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

Do you like the way that it's going down?  
  
Ooh, do you like the way

Lauryn Hill,Doo Wop,/l/lauryn+hill/doo+wop_10163224.html,"[Incomprehensible]  
Fell real good wavin' your hands in the air  
Admit two shots in the atmosphere  
Put 'em up, put 'em up  
  
(First Verse)  
  
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend  
The one you let hit it and never called you again  
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins?  
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim  
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend  
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?  
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him  
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again  
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian  
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gen(Gentile)  
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in  
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?  
Showing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend  
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again  
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine  
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem  
Baby girl, respect is just the minimum  
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him  
Now Lauryn is only human  
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament  
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been  
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in  
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans  
Fake nails up out Koreans  
  
[Hook]  
Come again  
Yo, when when come again  
When when come again  
My friend come again  
  
(Chorus)  
Guys you know you'd better, watch out  
Some girls, some girls are only, about  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
  
(Second Verse)  
The second verse is dedicated to the men  
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs (Timberlands) than his women  
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans  
Don't care who they offend poppin' yang, like you got yen  
Let's stop pretend, the wanna pack pistol by they waist men  
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement  
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men  
Need to take care of their three and four kids  
But they face a court case when the child support's late  
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men  
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men  
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?

Come again  
Yo yo, come again

Sit straight come again

Look out, look out  
Watch out, watch out  
Look out, look out

Skinny legs, a press and curl

The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill  
Made sure that I'd never go too far  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem  
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill  
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun  
""Kill the guy"" in Carter park  
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark  
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles  
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu  
Main street roots tonic with the dreds  
A beef patty and some coco bread  
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe

Moving Records was on Central Ave.  
I was there at dancing school

Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker

Fireworks at Martin stadium  
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be  
And car thieves got away through Irvington  
Hillside brings beef with the cops  
Self-Destruction record drops  
And everybody's name was Muslim  
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state  
And everybody used to do the wop  
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body  
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party  
I wish those days, they didn't stop  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been

Who won't accept deception, instead of what is truth

L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations  
Then came down for a little conversation  
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being  
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum

Develop a negative into a positive picture

We'll touch that dream  
But things come slow or not at all  
And the ones on top, won't make it stop  
So convinced that they might fall  
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail  
To make a better situation  
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow  
All we need is dedication

And checks to see if she is standing there.  
After years of traveling round  
With the raindeer hooves above the ground,  
Never made the mrs runaway.  
Remembering the night they met.  
Figure skating she played hard to get.  
In his red suit he sled past.  
Who can resist that charming laugh.  
He said he could teach her how to fly.  
  
Chorus:  
Even santa fell in love  
Everybody needs someone to come home to  
After the longest day  
Even santa fell in love  
And she's the only one he wants to come back to  
When the toys are put away  
  
Bridge: even on christmas day  
  
She sees his eyes are all a glow  
Anticipating children laughing in the snow  
And with just his christmas touch  
Under mistletoe before the rush  
Mrs kringle feels the tingle in the heart.

It wouldn't be the first time

Play with fire you get burned  
But fire can be oh so warm  
And that's why I return  
Turn and walk away

Happiness is two kinds of ice cream

Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band  
And happiness is walking hand in hand

Happiness is five different crayons  
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree  
Happiness is finding a nickel  
Catching a firefly, setting him free

All my life I've been a dreamer  
Dreamin' dreams that always broke in two  
But I still believe in love  
And I love believing  
Maybe you can make my dreams come true  
  
Here content with who I am  
I'm reachin' out my hand to him  
Once again  
At least I know I've made myself a friend  
  
All my life I've been a dreamer  
Dreamin' dreams that never quite came true  
But I still believe in love  
And I love believing  
I'll keep on dreaming  
Because I still believe in love  
  
I still believe in love  
And me  
And you  
I still believe in love

Somehow, somewhere our love will find a way  
And I believe that one day  
I'll hear you'll say that you love me all the way  
  
All the way, oh  
Love me all the way  
Love me, love me all the way  
Love me all the way, baby  
Pap-pap-pap-para-rap-pap-pap  
  
Love me, love me all the way

All the way

I will hear you say  
You love me all the way

Wouldn't you think my collections complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl  
The girl who has everything  
  
Look at this trove  
Treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Looking around here you'd think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty  
I've got who's, it's, and what's it's galore  
You want a Thing-A-Mabobs?  
I've got twenty  
But who cares?  
No big deal  
I want more!  
  
I wanna be where the people are  
I wanna see wanna see them dancing  
Walking around on those  
What do you call them?  
Oh, feet!  
  
Flippen your fins you don't get to far  
Legs are required for jumpin, dancin  
Strolling along down the  
What's that word again? Street  
  
Up where they walk  
Up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin free  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give  
If I could live outta these waters  
What would I pay to spend a day  
Warm on the sand  
  
Betcha on land they understand  
Bet they don't reprimend their daughters  
Bright young women  
Sick of swimming  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask them my questions and get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it  
What's the word... Burn  
  
When's it my turn  
Wouldn't I love  
Love to explore  
That shore up above  
  
Out of the Sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world

Ask me what you want... to know  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I won't let the darkness in,  
what a journey it has been.  
  
I have been to sorrow  
I have been to bliss  
Where I'll be tomorrow,  
I can only guess  
  
Through the darkest desert  
Through the deepest snow,  
Forward always forward, I go...  
  
What a journey it has been  
and the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I won't let the darkness in,  
what a journey it has been...  
  
Forward, always forward...  
Onward, always up...  
Catching every drop of hope  
In my empty cup  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day

Tell me what can I do

What's the way to love someone?  
Oh, my darling, did we know  
What it meant when we let go?

Have no fear

Within us all  
  
Although this world  
Can turn so cold  
When we reach inside  
We find our warmth  
  
'Cause there's a flame that burns  
In every heart  
And it's the will we have  
That lights the spark

Once in every lifetime  
There's a chance to stand apart  
We can show the world  
Our very best  
Reveal what's in our heart  
So the story goes and glory  
Never will end  
Inspiration lights the fire within  
  
And if we fall  
We won't stay down  
We will get back up  
And use the strength we've found  
  
And we will rise  
Like champions  
Every obstacle  
We'll overcome

And if we just stay strong  
Then our hearts will move us on

Well I, I can't remember  
The room is spinning and  
My heart is skipping beats  
Cause I finally cut all the ties  
That were hanging on me  
  
It's a sign of life  
To be so confused  
You jump and it feels  
Like you're falling  
  
[Chorus]  
You find the hope, the  
strength, the heart  
And just when you think  
there's nothing left  
Cause when it feels just like  
you're drowning  
That's when you fight for  
every breath  
You find the faith, the will,  
the words  
To break through the silence  
and the pain  
Cause when it feels just like  
you're dyin'  
That's a sign of life  
  
Sooner or later  
You come to the point  
Where you have to choose  
Who and what you want to be  
And I made a decision  
Not so long ago  
To be happy  
  
It's a sign of life  
To be unafraid  
You jump and it feels  
Like you're flying

Shattered  
My reflection is scattered  
Like ashes in the wind  
I'll begin again

Yet still I'll wait  
For you to see the light  
  
I'm the one who really loves you baby  
I can't take it anymore

You are my only I've ever known

Should we stay or should we bend

No point in feeling purer boy, your background intervenes  
Listen good and listen straight, you're not the master of your fate

At times acclaimed, at times reviled  
You wind up doing just what I've done

Round and round we go  
In and out and up and over  
Give me your love - ooh I need your love - I want your love  
  
I couldn't see the forest for the trees  
And every guy that tried to turn my head  
Could not obstruct my view  
You love me child you always will  
In this you have no choice  
You sign yourself to me every time you hear my voice  
  
Back in the day when you was leading the pack  
Honey you're my man - young gifted and black  
Riding around in an old '64  
I even let you touch me, even let you score  
And I gave in when you held me  
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me  
And you loved me and you wanted me  
And you moaned and you groaned so don't be crazy  
Couldn't see the forest baby, through the trees  
All I saw was you - ooh baby  
And we moved, and we grooved  
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me

Lenny Kravitz,Mean Sleep,/l/lenny+kravitz/mean+sleep_10164449.html,"Written by: cree summer  
  
What can we scrape together  
With just the flesh as evidence  
Handfuls of hate and the bittersweet ambivalence  
'cause I am pushing cobwebs and I'm folding into myself  
Who will find me under this mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life  
  
You could burn a thousand days  
And I would need no other light  
You could die a thousand ways  
And I'd still love you back to life  
But my needs rising angry and loneliness like quicksand  
Who will find me under still mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life  
  
I am lost to the longing  
I am moulded by my memory  
Had shut down half my mind  
Just to still the space you left behind  
'cause I am pushing cobwebs and I'm folding into myself  
Who will find me under this mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life

You try and hide your sorrow  
Now you're alone again  
So you block out your emotion  
Laugh it off and carry on  
Sayin' why do i have to feel this way  
Was loving you so wrong  
  
If i could only turn around  
One more time for old time's sake  
I'd pick up all the pieces  
From the mistakes i made  
Did i give myself completely  
Or did i hang on for too long  
Ah, but what's the use of me talking this way  
Now that you're gone  
  
No looking back, it's over now  
All over now  
I tell myself i'm glad  
It's over now  
All over now  
It's over now  
  
But if i ever love again  
Oh, i won't be played a fool  
I'll put in my performance  
This time i'll know the moves  
It's not that i'm feeling bitter

And all i'm really trying to say

It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace  
Their knee in your balls and their fist in your face  
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made  
Sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late

Leonard Cohen,Alexandra Leaving,/l/leonard+cohen/alexandra+leaving_20082866.html,"Suddenly the night has grown colder.  
The god of love preparing to depart.  
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,  
They slip between the sentries of the heart.  
  
Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure,  
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine  
And radiant beyond your widest measure  
They fall among the voices and the wine.  
  
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,  
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this.  
  
As someone long prepared for this to happen,  
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in.  
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing.  
Your firm commitments tangible again.  
  
And you who had the honor of her evening,  
And by the honor had your own restored  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Alexandra leaving with her lord.  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this.  
  
As someone long prepared for the occasion  
In full command of every plan you wrecked  
Do not choose a coward's explanation  
that hides behind the cause and the effect.  
  
And you who were bewildered by a meaning  
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.  
  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.

Leonard Cohen,Ballad Of The Absent Mare,/l/leonard+cohen/ballad+of+the+absent+mare_20082837.html,"Say a prayer for the cowboy  
His mare's run away  
And he'll walk til he finds her  
His darling, his stray  
But the river's in flood  
And the roads are awash  
And the bridges break up  
In the panic of loss.  
  
And there's nothing to follow  
There's nowhere to go  
She's gone like the summer  
Gone like the snow  
And the crickets are breaking  
His heart with their song  
As the day caves in  
And the night is all wrong  
  
Did he dream, was it she  
Who went galloping past  
And bent down the fern  
Broke open the grass  
And printed the mud with  
The iron and the gold  
That he nailed to her feet  
When he was the lord  
  
And although she goes grazing  
A minute away  
He tracks her all night  
He tracks her all day  
Oh blind to her presence  
Except to compare  
His injury here  
With her punishment there  
  
Then at home on a branch  
In the highest tree  
A songbird sings out  
So suddenly  
Ah the sun is warm  
And the soft winds ride  
On the willow trees  
By the river side  
  
Oh the world is sweet  
The world is wide  
And she's there where  
The light and the darkness divide  
And the steam's coming off her  
She's huge and she's shy  
And she steps on the moon  
When she paws at the sky  
  
And she comes to his hand  
But she's not really tame  
She longs to be lost  
He longs for the same  
And she'll bolt and she'll plunge  
Through the first open pass  
To roll and to feed  
In the sweet mountain grass  
  
Or she'll make a break  
For the high plateau  
Where there's nothing above  
And there's nothing below  
And it's time for the burden  
It's time for the whip  
Will she walk through the flame  
Can he shoot from the hip  
  
So he binds himself  
To the galloping mare  
And she binds herself  
To the rider there  
And there is no space  
But there's left and right  
And there is no time  
But there's day and night  
  
And he leans on her neck  
And he whispers low  
""Whither thou goest  
I will go""  
And they turn as one  
And they head for the plain  
No need for the whip  
Ah, no need for the rein  
  
Now the clasp of this union  
Who fastens it tight?  
Who snaps it asunder  
The very next night  
Some say the rider  
Some say the mare  
Or that love's like the smoke  
Beyond all repair  
  
But my darling says  
""Leonard, just let it go by  
That old silhouette  
On the great western sky""  
So I pick out a tune  
And they move right along  
And they're gone like the smoke  
And they're gone like this song

That you made in the barn  
When the kittens were born  
And you could not keep warm  
So you moved away the mountain  
That the sun rose behind  
And you said yourself a prayer  
And laid down with the blind  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now, you're wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybody's child  
And the vow of compassion  
That you swore through your teeth  
When the war began to end  
And the photographs weep  
Well, nobody blames you  
As the train pulls away  
With its cargo of snow  
For these German paper-weights  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now, you're wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybody's child  
Well, its five in the morning  
There's no one home  
Except for your wife  
And your child on the phone  
Somebody's got to listen  
To a promise or two  
Oh, this room is far too small  
For a pilgrim like you  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now, you're wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybody's child  
So, now that you've decided  
To follow the sun  
Like a shadow of birds  
Or a King on the run  
Oh, your chains are too dark  
For the seas you must swim  
You're smiling at the seaweed  
But your smile is too grim  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now, you're wild

For such a lonely choice  
And surely she would answer  
To such a very hopeless voice  
  
I practiced all my sainthood  
I gave to one and all  
But the rumors of my virtue  
They moved her not at all  
  
I changed my style to silver  
I changed my clothed to black  
And where I would surrender  
Now I would attack  
  
I stormed the old casino  
For the money and the flesh  
And I myself decided  
What was rotten and what was fresh  
  
And men to do my bidding  
And broken bones to teach  
The value of my pardon  
The shadow of my reach  
  
But no, I could not touch her  
With such a heavy hand  
Her star beyond my order  
Her nakedness unmanned  
  
I came so far for beauty  
I left so much behind  
My patience and my family

Let the earth proclaim

Come healing of the name

To lift the little bud  
O longing of the arteries  
To purify the blood

Just when all the bills are due

And springtime starts but then it stops  
In the name of something new

And I know what I must do  
Another mile of silence while I'm  
Coming back to you

And many still to be  
Since you are a shining light  
There's many that you'll see  
But I have to deal with envy  
When you choose the precious few  
Who've left their pride on the other side of

Or none of it is true

Leonard Cohen,Death Of A Ladies' Man,/l/leonard+cohen/death+of+a+ladies+man_20082799.html,"Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread  
""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said.  
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.  
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet.  
""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come  
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""  
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust  
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost  
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view  
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to  
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood  
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs,  
I'll show you solitude.""  
  
He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room  
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb  
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon  
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon  
  
She took his much admired oriental frame of mind  
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind  
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine  
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""  
  
He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track  
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""  
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,  
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache.  
  
The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get  
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet  
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy  
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.  
  
So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed  
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed  
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star  
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.  
  
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star

Leonard Cohen,Democracy,/l/leonard+cohen/democracy_20082879.html,"It's coming through a hole in the air,  
From those nights in Tiananmen Square.  
It's coming from the feel  
That this ain't exactly real,  
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.  
From the wars against disorder,  
From the sirens night and day,  
From the fires of the homeless,  
From the ashes of the gay:  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming through a crack in the wall  
On a visionary flood of alcohol  
From the staggering account  
Of the Sermon on the Mount  
Which I don't pretend to understand at all.  
It's coming from the silence  
On the dock of the bay,  
From the brave, the bold, the battered  
Heart of Chevrolet  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the sorrow in the street,  
The holy places where the races meet  
From the homicidal bitchin'  
That goes down in every kitchen  
To determine who will serve and who will eat.  
From the wells of disappointment  
Where the women kneel to pray  
For the grace of God in the desert here  
And the desert far away:  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
Sail on, sail on  
O mighty Ship of State!  
To the Shores of Need  
Past the Reefs of Greed  
Through the Squalls of Hate  
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.  
  
It's coming to America first,  
The cradle of the best and of the worst.  
It's here they got the range  
And the machinery for change  
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.  
It's here the family's broken  
And it's here the lonely say  
That the heart has got to open  
In a fundamental way:  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the women and the men.  
O baby, we'll be making love again.  
We'll be going down so deep  
The river's going to weep,  
And the mountain's going to shout Amen!  
It's coming like the tidal flood  
Beneath the lunar sway,  
Imperial, mysterious,  
In amorous array  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
Sail on, sail on  
  
I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean  
I love the country but I can't stand the scene.  
And I'm neither left or right  
I'm just staying home tonight,  
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen.  
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags  
That Time cannot decay,  
I'm junk but I'm still holding up  
This little wild bouquet  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.

But you see that line there moving through the station?  
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those  
  
Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win  
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline  
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I don't like your fashion business mister  
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin  
I don't like what happened to my sister  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I'd really like to live beside you, baby  
  
And I thank you for those items that you sent me  
The monkey and the plywood violin  
I practiced every night, now I'm ready  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I am guided  
  
Ah remember me, I used to live for music  
Remember me, I brought your groceries in  
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

Leonard Cohen,Go No More A-Roving,/l/leonard+cohen/go+no+more+a+roving_10164551.html,"[Dedicated to Irving Layton]  
  
So we'll go no more a-roving  
So late into the night,  
Though the heart be still as loving,  
And the moon be still as bright.  
For the sword outwears its sheath,  
And the soul outwears the breast,  
And the heart must pause to breathe,  
And love itself have rest.  
Though the night was made for loving,  
And the day returns too soon,  
Yet we'll go no more a-roving  
By the light of the moon.

Leonard Cohen,"God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot",/l/leonard+cohen/god+is+alive+magic+is+afoot_20589896.html,"(Lyrics: Cohen, Recorded By Buffy Sainte-Marie)  
  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is afoot, magic is alive  
Alive is afoot, magic never died  
God never sickened  
Many poor men lied  
Many sick men lied  
Magic never weakened  
Magic never hid  
Magic always ruled  
God is afoot, God never died  
God was ruler  
Though his funeral lengthened  
Though his mourners thickened  
Magic never fled  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
Though his words were twisted  
The naked magic thrived  
Though his death was published  
Round and round the world  
The heart did not believe  
  
Many hurt men wondered  
Many struck men bled  
Magic never faltered  
Magic always lead  
Many stones were rolled  
But God would not lie down  
Many wild men lied  
Many fat men listened  
Though they offered stones  
Magic still was fed  
Though they locked their coffers  
God was always served  
Magic is afoot, God is alive  
Alive is afoot  
  
Alive is in command  
Many weak men hungered  
Many strong men thrived  
Though they boast of solitude  
God was at their side  
Nor the dreamer in his cell  
Nor the captain on the hill  
Magic is alive  
Though his death was pardoned  
Round and round the world  
The heart would not believe  
  
Though laws were carved in marble  
They could not shelter men  
Though altars built in parliaments  
They could not order men  
Police arrested magic and magic went with them  
Mmmmm.... For magic loves the hungry  
But magic would not tarry  
It moves from arm to arm  
It would not stay with them  
Magic is afoot  
It cannot come to harm  
It rests in an empty palm  
It spawns in an empty mind  
But magic is no instrument  
Magic is the end  
Many men drove magic  
But magic stayed behind  
Many strong men lied  
They only passed through magic  
And out the other side  
Many weak men lied  
They came to God in secret  
And though they left Him nourished  
They would not tell who healed  
Though mountains danced before them  
They said that God was dead  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
This I mean to whisper to my mind  
This I mean to laugh within my mind  
This I mean my mind to serve  
Til' service is but magic  
Moving through the world  
And mind itself is magic  
Coursing through the flesh  
And flesh itself is magic  
Dancing on a clock  
And time itself  
The magic length of God

Leonard Cohen,Hallelujah,/l/leonard+cohen/hallelujah_20082898.html,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this  
The fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall, the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her  
She tied you  
To a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
You say I took the name in vain  
I don't even know the name  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

In city and in forest they smiled like me and you,

Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme  
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,

That we pledged in the passionate night  
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges  
Like moths on a still yellow light  
No penance serves to renew them  
No massive transfusions of trust  
Why not even revenge can undo them  
So twisted these vows and so crushed  
  
And you say you've been humbled in love  
Cut down in your love  
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me  
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one  
Who kneels there as deeply as thee  
  
Children have takes these pledges  
They have ferried them out of the past  
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges  
Where love must go hiding at last  
And here where there is no description  
Oh here in the moment at hand  
No sinner need rise up forgiven  
No victim need limp to the stand  
  
And you say you've been humbled in love  
And look dear heart, look at the virgin  
Look how she welcomes him into her gown  
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour  
Dissolves like a star falling down  
Why trade this vision for desire  
When you may have them both  
You will never see a man this naked  
I will never hold a woman this close

Not by begging on his knees  
Or I'd crawl to you baby  
And I'd fall at your feet  
And I'd howl at your beauty  
Like a dog in heat  
And I'd claw at your heart  
And I'd tear at your sheet  
I'd say please, please

And if you've got to sleep  
A moment on the road,  
I will steer for you  
And if you want to work the street alone,

Between the tunnel and the train,

On the very love which I, I do not wish to claim,  
I journey down the hundred steps,  
But the street is still the very same.  
And here, right here,

Between the sailboat and the drain,  
Between the newsreel and your tiny pain,

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne?  
Where are the paths your heroes came?  
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away,  
Was I, was I only limping, was I really lame?  
Oh here, come over here,  
Between the windmill and the grain,  
Between the sundial and the chain,  
Between the traitor and her pain,

Yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose.  
  
I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come,  
The cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone.

All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us?  
And where do all these highways go, now that we are free?  
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?

You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal.  
The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask  
The nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass.  
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite,  
And one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night.  
  
O come with me my little one, we will find that farm  
And grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm.  
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am,  
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb.  
With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl  
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world.  
  
We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky,  
And lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.

Leonard Cohen,Teachers,/l/leonard+cohen/teachers_20082891.html,"I met a woman long ago  
Her hair the black that black can go,  
Are you a teacher of the heart?  
Soft she answered, no.  
  
I met a girl across the sea,  
Her hair the gold that gold can be,  
Are you a teacher of the heart?  
Yes, but not for thee.  
  
I met a man who lost his mind  
In some lost place I had to find,  
Follow me, the wise man said,  
But he walked behind.  
  
I walked into a hospital  
Where none was sick and none was well,  
When at night the nurses left  
I could not walk at all.  
  
Morning came and then came noon,  
Dinner time a scalpel blade  
Lay beside my silver spoon.  
  
Some girls wander by mistake  
Into the mess that scalpels make.  
Are you the teachers of my heart?  
We teach old hearts to break.  
  
One morning I woke up alone,  
The hospital and the nurses gone.  
Have I carved enough my Lord?  
Child, you are a bone.  
  
I ate and ate and ate,  
No, I did not miss a plate, well  
How much do these suppers cost?  
Well take it out in hate.  
  
I spent my hatred everyplace,  
On every work, on every face,  
Someone gave me wishes  
And I wished for an embrace.  
  
Several girls embraced me, then  
I was embraced by men,  
Is my passion perfect?  
No, do it once again.  
  
I was handsome, I was strong,  
I knew the words of every song.  
Did my singing please you?  
No, the words you sang were wrong.  
  
Who is it whom I address,  
Who takes down what I confess?  
Are you the teachers of my heart?  
We teach old hearts to rest.  
  
Oh teachers are my lessons done?  
I cannot do another one.  
They laughed and laughed and said  
Well child,  
Are your lessons done?  
Are your lessons done?  
Are your lessons done?

Leonard Cohen,The Butcher,/l/leonard+cohen/the+butcher_20082853.html,"I came upon a butcher,  
He was slaughtering a lamb,  
I accused him there  
With his tortured lamb.  
  
He said, Listen to me, child,  
I am what I am and you, you are my only son.  
Well, I found a silver needle,  
I put it into my arm.  
  
It did some good,  
Did some harm.  
But the nights were cold  
And it almost kept me warm,  
How come the night is long?  
I saw some flowers growing up  
Where that lamb fell down  
  
Was I supposed to praise my Lord,  
Make some kind of joyful sound?  
He said, Listen, listen to me now,  
I go round and round  
And you, you are my only child.  
  
Do not leave me now,  
Do not leave me now,  
I'm broken down  
From a recent fall.  
  
Blood upon my body  
And ice upon my soul,  
Lead on, my son, it is your world.

Sights and best of wishes and  
A silence you can hear  
The vow that breaks the world are spoke  
And the whole world sheds a tear

O brother be good to me  
The way is long and the shrine is far  
Where my weary feet would be  
And feasting is always somewhat sad  
To those outside the door  
Still love is only a dream  
And life itself is hardly more

And lends an ear  
The vows that break the world are spoke

Leonard Cohen,The Stranger Song,/l/leonard+cohen/the+stranger+song_20082892.html,"It's true that all the men you knew were dealers  
Who said they were through with dealing  
Every time you gave them shelter  
I know that kind of man  
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone  
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender  
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.  
  
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind  
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter  
Like any dealer he was watching for the card  
That is so high and wild  
He'll never need to deal another  
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger  
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.  
  
And then leaning on your window sill  
He'll say one day you caused his will  
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter  
And then taking from his wallet  
An old schedule of trains, he'll say  
I told you when I came I was a stranger  
I told you when I came I was a stranger.  
  
But now another stranger seems  
To want you to ignore his dreams  
As though they were the burden of some other  
O you've seen that man before  
His golden arm dispatching cards  
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger  
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter  
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.  
  
Ah you hate to see another tired man  
Lay down his hand  
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker  
And while he talks his dreams to sleep  
You notice there's a highway  
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder  
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.  
  
You tell him to come in sit down  
But something makes you turn around  
The door is open you can't close your shelter  
You try the handle of the road  
It opens do not be afraid  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger.  
  
Well, I've been waiting, I was sure  
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for  
I think it's time to board another  
Please understand, I never had a secret chart  
To get me to the heart of this  
Or any other matter  
When he talks like this  
You don't know what he's after  
When he speaks like this,  
You don't know what he's after.  
  
Let's meet tomorrow if you choose  
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge  
That they are building on some endless river  
Then he leaves the platform  
For the sleeping car that's warm  
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter  
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger  
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.  
  
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ...  
  
And leaning on your window sill ...  
  
I told you when I came I was a stranger.

Taking the chances  
Of one who is lost  
  
Feeling his way  
To a cleaner expression  
Of whatever it was

All for the sake  
Of a possible woman  
He goaded himself  
With a technical hope  
  
For the sake of his longing  
We came to the window  
He put on his cloths  
And he walked through the smoke  
  
All for the sake  
Of an interested woman  
Riding to him  
On a flicker of hope  
  
Some tourist of beauty  
In full disappointment  
Ready to fall  
In love with a ghost  
  
And here was his ghost  
With his third invention  
The usual claim  
To the highest reward  
  
And now it was ready  
His third invention  
Ready to fall  
In love with the world  
  
And he falls back  
And she comes forward  
The eye of his labour  
Measures them both  
  
And she lies in the arms  
Of his third invention  
And back in his room  
He commences the fourth

Of the highest pretension  
An automatic  
Ode to the world

O full employment

He's lost to the third.

And they cover their breasts  
With a shadow  
And they nail my good right hand

From the thorns and the fire  
And let me recline

Will want, will want, will want  
Will more than want me!

Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide  
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer  
And the judges watched us from the other side  
  
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you  
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear  
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you  
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""  
  
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever  
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame  
She said at last I was her finest lover  
And if she withered I would be to blame  
  
The judges said you missed it by a fraction  
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack  
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action  
Oh see the men of action falling back  
  
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment  
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still  
My falsity had stung me like a hornet  
The poison sank and it paralyzed my will  
  
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers  
That they had been deserted from above  
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona  
I'm listed with the enemies of love  
  
And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,  
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon  
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping  
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""

Her eternal

Leonard Cohen,To A Teacher,/l/leonard+cohen/to+a+teacher_10164561.html,"[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]  
Hurt once and for all into silence.  
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.  
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,  
When you glinted in every eye the held-high  
Razor, shivering every ram and son?  
And now the silent loony bin, where  
The shadows live in the rafters like  
Day-weary bats,  
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,  
Lures them to exaggerate  
Mountain-size on the white stone wall  
Your tiny limp.  
How can I leave you in such a house?  
Are there no more saints and wizards  
To praise their ways with pupils,  
No more evil to stun with the slap  
Of a wet red tongue?  
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror  
And rest because he had finally come?  
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.  
I have entered under this dark roof  
As fearlessly as an honoured son  
Enters his father's house.

I ache in the places where I used to play  
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on

I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?  
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet  
But I hear him coughing all night long  
A hundred floors above me  
In the Tower of Song  
  
I was born like this, I had no choice  
I was born with the gift of a golden voice  
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond  
They tied me to this table right here  
In the Tower of Song  
  
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll  
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all  
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong  
Ah they don't let a woman kill you  
Not in the Tower of Song  
  
Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure  
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor  
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong  
You see, you hear these funny voices  
In the Tower of Song  
  
I see you standing on the other side  
I don't know how the river got so wide  
I loved you baby, way back when  
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed  
But I feel so close to everything that we lost  
We'll never have to lose it again  
  
Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back  
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track  
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone  
I'll be speaking to you sweetly  
From a window in the Tower of Song  
  
Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is gray  
I ache in the places where I used to play

As a falling leaf may rest  
A moment on the air  
So your head upon my breast

Without a moon or star

And they kill for the bones in the street  
And God in his heaven

Cause he's dead as the stiffs at my feet  
  
I raise my eyes to see the heavens  
And only the moon looks down

When their voices were soft  
And their words inviting  
There was a time when love was blind  
And the world was a song  
And the song was exciting  
There was a time  
Then it all went wrong  
  
I dreamed a dream in times gone by  
When hope was high  
And life worth living  
I dreamed that love would never die  
I dreamed that God would be forgiving  
Then I was young and unafraid  
And dreams were made and used and wasted  
There was no ransom to be paid  
No song unsung  
No wine untasted  
But the tigers come at night  
With their voices soft as thunder  
As they tear your hope apart  
And they turn your dream to shame

He filled my days with endless wonder  
He took my childhood in his stride  
But he was gone when autumn came  
And still I dream he'll come to me  
That we'll live the years together  
But there are dreams that cannot be  
And there are storms we cannot weather

So different from this hell I'm living  
So different now from what it seemed  
Now life has killed

There is a story, sir

That you alone must know.  
  
I never told Cosette  
She had enough of tears  
She's never known the truth  
Of the story you must hear  
Of years ago.  
  
There lived a man named Jean Valjean  
He stole some bread to save his sister's son  
For nineteen winters served his time  
In sweat he washed away his crime  
Years ago  
He broke parole and lived a life apart  
How could he tell Cosette and break her heart?  
It's for Cosette that this must be faced  
If he is caught she is disgraced  
The time is come to journey on  
And from this day he must be gone  
Who am I?  
Who am I?

You're Jean Valjean!  
What can I do

A long way away  
Tell her my heart was too full for farewells  
It is better this way  
Promise me, M'sieur, Cosette will never know.

Like thirty in my mouth, so I can say  
Fuck you bitch you still ain't got a dirty mouth  
The hood still ain't got over the drout  
So you should sleep on your roof, just to watch over ya house  
Nigga we tymin', the cost of my watch over ya house  
I'm a boss man, I watch over the South  
Jazze Pha, let's hop in the Lammy (Lamborghini)  
Stop by Sammy, chill in the hood, you good, you family  
My boys like to pull them blammies, and big pimp  
Mami suck dick 'til she pull your hammy, homey  
You know we only, keepin it gangsta  
Deep in the Range, 17 in the chamber  
All I need is my banger, nigga it's Weezy

[Lil' Wayne]  
You don't want to play wit me, I touch you man  
Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me  
Y'all can't hear me, this a def jam, call me Russell, man  
I played on Martin, call me hustle, man  
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man  
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder  
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water  
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or  
High with water, how do you want it man  
Hey, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun  
I den drove a lot of QP's from, here and there on the road  
For the nigga gotta move his son, and I show you how to do this son  
That's, that boy Weezy We, CMB, bitch, and ya stunned

What you been workin' on nigga?  
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album  
And I'm finally workin' on my album, ya dig  
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga  
That's what it is  
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together  
That's that ""I Can't Feel My Face Shit"" they know what  
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide  
Guess what, we already did  
  
[Juelz Santana]  
I'm feelin' like a black Republican  
Naw, I can't call it  
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office  
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it  
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya  
I protect my land like a farmer  
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara  
Or should I say fat like the Parkers  
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra  
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered  
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers  
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness  
Rock star, flier than an ostrich  
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass  
I shall shine forever, never tarnish  
Money buried behind my house like a garden  
All green, my bank account's like a forest  
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started  
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig  
A black activist like Sonny Carson  
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me  
And chicks, I get 'em high  
Higher than turbulence is  
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious  
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims  
It's get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim  
Ai!  
Now all y'all listen  
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

Tote a mac in the public and  
Act so southern n' die for my brethren  
Money, money, money  
Like money Mac and publishing  
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan  
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covered in em  
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan  
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan  
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them  
And my mind is on another continent  
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit  
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick  
Bet I get all in her mouth like polident  
New Orleans representa to the inner  
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer  
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep  
Wake a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be  
  
[Santana]  
  
I'm feelin like a black republican drug money comin in  
I'm a volcano filled with lava bout to erupt again  
I stay with the iron don't make me plug it in  
Stay outta rich kid's business don't be buttin in  
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it  
Forget her tongue she put her lung on it ha  
My listerine comes out she start guzzerin  
I'm above you dudes I'm hoverin  
Juelz why you duckin them duckin who?  
I'm in the hood like what it do comfortable  
And believe me it's nothin to  
Send my london boys to english muffin you  
You poodles barkin too much they bringin muzzles through  
You aint gully you gullible  
Man they need love, they need hugs,  
They need church, Jesus  
This is jus a sample yea a free drug  
The shipment is in, we done re-d up  
But I don't trust dudes like a pre-nup  
They cockaroaches, they gotta be bug  
Maybe cause they them  
And we us and we up  
I'm ballin fareal ya gotta d-up

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]  
I like them big, round, yellow and brown  
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (ugh ugh) sound  
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up  
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut  
Bounce for ya hood, shake for ya baby daddy  
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the caddy  
Slide with the ky, hold up ?  
My bitch got thong, you bitch got drawls  
My chick like to swallow, yo chick like to spit  
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch  
Hold up, chill out, wait a minute stop  
My ginseng, Viagra, and a strawberry pop  
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, why don't ya bring a friend  
From vagina to the asshole do it again  
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever  
Yo mama loved a tymer, now you welcome  
You OK lil mama and I love that chick  
But deep down inside I just love me dick

Lil Wayne,Breakin' My Heart,/l/lil+wayne/breakin+my+heart_20663244.html,"(feat. Little Brother)  
  
Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow
groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me
and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for
you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done
gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.  
  
[Bridge:]  
She loves me, she loves me not.  
  
[Verse 1: Little Brother]  
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.  
You wanted the role, smash the audition.  
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.  
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.  
And some say it's the life I was given.  
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.  
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.  
On a new broad, you still one to one.  
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.  
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.  
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.  
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.  
The last thought I get is Koobie run.  
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.  
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Brother]  
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.  
Every morning, and every evening.  
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.  
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.  
In the nfl which mean Not For Long.  
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.  
Word get back to wifey, she like ""Stop the song,""  
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.  
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.  
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.  
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.  
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.  
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.  
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.  
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.  
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.  
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record.  
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.  
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]  
I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.  
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.  
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.  
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.  
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.  
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.  
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.  
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.  
And I know cheaters never get crowned.  
So I play ""fair"" like roller coasters and clowns.  
You gotta hold ya soldier down.  
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.  
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.  
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv.  
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought.  
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart

Slow paper is better than no paper  
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it  
You gotta know that paper

Gotta know that photo-fobia, no Kodak moments

I don't do too much posin', got a cool killer look  
Career crook, get your career took

Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer  
Around here and this here is The Carter  
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama  
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter  
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada

On the day I left is when it thawed out

But when the shows ends she all in my skin,  
Lotions, no emotions, rollarcoasting like back forth,  
Hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it)  
She pose like it's for posters,  
And I poke like I'm supposed to,  
Take this photo if you for me,  
Don't you ever show this,  
I'm too loyal, and too focused  
To be losing and be hopeless,  
When I spoke this she rejoiced it,  
Tell your words, get me open,  
So I closed it, where your clothes is?  
I'm only lovin for the moment.

Minimum wage 5.15. 132s on the whip  
Kept my shit clean  
Actually that was my momma shit  
But I'm driving round town on my Obama shit  
Middle class my ass, just to get a tank of gas  
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit  
But, yeah I'm headed for a scholarship  
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip  
That's why them niggas don't like me and always wanna fight me  
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely  
I know the game I'm an expert  
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?  
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone  
And I aint fuck yet cause her momma always home

Tall white tee's, can't believe we used to wear those  
White folks looking at us like we're weirdos

Fucked then I'll pass, y'all Utah Jazz  
And ya'll borin', I don't play nigga I'm Mark Madsen

Lil Wayne,Grown Man,/l/lil+wayne/grown+man_10165245.html,"Dawg you gotta feel me on this one  
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit  
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga  
Geezy, Juve and Turk, be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg  
[Verse 1]  
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this  
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch  
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip  
I slip a clip in every rip , cas hatas likely to trip  
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip  
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit  
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when I'm pissed  
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit  
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly  
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me  
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court  
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start  
Its like i'm livin happy now  
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now  
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts  
and puff a cooler bust me up  
And say a prayer for everyday  
just so I get through the stuff but I be like  
(Chorus) - 2x  
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man  
being responsible for everybody and yo own man  
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man  
I'm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN  
[Verse 2]  
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up  
And usually I'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up  
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts  
And i get hit up with all kinda stress  
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough  
But I mantain to climb through it all  
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball  
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow  
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall  
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution  
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion  
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it  
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me  
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit  
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest  
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do  
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through  
(Chorus) - 2x  
[Verse 3]  
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic  
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it  
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became  
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game  
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change  
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change  
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants  
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man  
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it  
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit  
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeced at last  
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path  
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me  
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me  
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone  
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown  
so I'll be good on my own but I be like

And it feels so stray  
N.g.e. wouldn't you say  
I use to  
Call u bay  
And u use to obey  
And I just wish we could  
  
""Do it again"" [x3]  
  
Hey  
I got my business together  
Wish I could get together  
But timing is an error  
And I  
Tell a lie  
To you like ever  
If I was even ever  
Given another chance to  
  
""Do it again""  
  
Like I died  
And gone to heaven  
Climbed inside a treasure  
Died inside of pleasure like  
Wow  
Your smile is but of essence  
Your child is so precious  
I wish  
It was paternally mine  
But karma is a message  
But imma try to test it  
And scream for a blessing  
So loud  
And I hope that you would catch it  
And one day you would come fallin  
Out of the most highest cloud  
Then I'll be there to catch you  
Yes  
I'll be there to let you  
Do da things  
We didn't do before  
Now  
Next time we have to stretch it  
Do it never forget it  
I never forgot  
I wish dat we could  
  
""Do it again"" [x3]  
  
Hey  
I'm just trynna talk to you  
If I could talk to you  
Den I would talk  
Forever and a day  
Yes I remember  
So vividly  
How we would be  
When we lay  
And my then blue skies  
Were no longer gray  
She so brightened up my day  
Put it on a scripture  
She would be a picture  
If perfect had a face  
I promise you homie  
Dat u would be hungry like me  
If you had a taste  
I put it on my momma  
Cus baby girl is a flower  
A flower without a vase  
No water needed at all  
She continues to grow  
More beautiful everyday  
And I love her somethin vicious  
And I'm just wishin  
We could  
  
""Do it again"" [x3]

On account of my stupidity.

Look at this life I still don't know where it's going.

Look at these eyes they never seen what matters.  
Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you.  
That may be all I need to know.  
  
So many questions still left unanswered.  
So much I've never broken through.  
And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly.  
That only truth I'll never know is me and you.  
  
Look at this man so blessed with inspiration.  
Look at this soul still searching for salvation.

This place is just as pretty  
As I pictured it to be  
But a man in need of work's  
An all too common sight to see  
Each morning as the trucks roll in  
A lucky few climb on  
And the rest of us are left to wonder  
Where the dream has gone  
Where the dream has gone  
They say the Sierra melts with the rain  
To race through the valley like blood through the vein  
Turning the lowland from golden to green  
To harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin  
Every day I struggle  
With the distance and the fear  
That I will not return  
Or find a way to bring you here  
My emptiness grows deeper  
I feel my spirit fall  
As night comes like a blanket  
It brings no sleep at all  
I only hope that time will find  
A way to work things out  
We will be together  
In the life we dream about  
Life we dream about

You will reach the Union Depot  
Into which your train will ride  
There you'll meet the superintendent  
God the father, God the son  
With a happy joyous greeting  
Weary pilgrim, welcome home  
Blessed Saviour there to guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
And the angels there to join us  
In God's grace forevermore  
In God's grace forevermore

What can you do  
Old girl you're through  
Sit there and count your little fingers  
Unlucky little girl blue  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time you knew  
All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
No use old girl  
You may as well surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer up little girl blue  
  
When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky  
Above the ring I love so well  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsel and gold  
  
All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue

Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side  
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen  
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means.  
  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time  
  
Caught in my fears  
Blinking back the tears  
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near  
And I never drew one response from you  
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time  
  
Wait for the day  
You'll go away  
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay  
And life's full of flaws  
Who knows the cause?  
Living in the memory of a love that never was  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind  
and I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time.

Ah but women like Louise well they get by

When they found Louise in her room  
They'd always put her down below their kind  
Still some cried when she died this afternoon  
  
Louise rode home on the mail train

Too bad it ended so ugly  
Too bad she had to go this way  
  
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight

With distingue traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your siren song  
To tempt me to madness

Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me  
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong  
  
Life is lonely again  
And only last year everything seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore  
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it  
All I care is to smile in spite of it  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain  
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive  
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive

While I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too

If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer  
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer  
By myself (myself)  
  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself

How do you think  
I've lost so much  
I'm so afraid  
I'm out of touch  
How do you expect  
I will know what to do  
When all I know  
Is what you tell me to  
  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't hold on  
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)  
It's all too much to take in  
I can't hold on  
(To anything watching everything spin)  
Without some failure sinking

The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal not a role model  
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame  
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain  
And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
Because once you get a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first  
And I'm not a robot. I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
Stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker

Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step I ain't the one  
Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
  
I'm awfully underrated but pay me to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for record  
I am the opposite of where I got this  
A weak opposite, a slack sending them  
A heat sending them  
A crack closest to a peak  
Far from a punk

Come for me, I'll be gone

Come for me, I'll be gone

Linkin Park,Hands Held High,/l/linkin+park/hands+held+high_20416893.html,"Turn my mic up louder,  
I got to say something.  
Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,  
The syllables get pumping.  
People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,  
We march to the drumming.  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping.  
Fuck that, I want to  
See some fist pumping.  
Risk something.  
Take back what's yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
'Cause I'm sick of being treated  
Like I had before.  
Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.

So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside  
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long

Waiting, is something that's easy for you  
Pull the plug, send it down the drain  
Pain is easy to get used to  
What's in me, is in you  
What's got me, has got you  
And everything told, must come true  
  
Pretending to be real, forgetting who you are  
Sin, is always at my door  
Slice the vein, blood spilled on the floor  
Light shining in my eyes  
Death greets me with a smile  
Pain  
So much pain  
Pain  
So much pain

When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown  
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now  
You were there impossibly alone.

You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.  
  
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel  
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars  
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space  
No one there to catch you in their arms

Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now  
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down  
The melting pot of a super-future X-style  
The combination of a vocal caress  
With lungs that gasp for breath  
From emotional stress  
With special effects

Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Projected daily through the sound of the source  
Everybody on board with this blend

The mightiest is the weapons  
Swinging right from the chin  
The elevate of mental states  
Long gone with the wind  
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends  
It's going down

Trekking through the weaponry  
Of the pure pedigree  
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me  
Whatever the weather be

Everyday reminded how much I hate it  
Weighted against the consequences  
Can't live without it, so it's senseless  
Wanna cut it out of my soul  
And just live with a gaping hole  
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste  
I made the problems in the first place  
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me  
You hardly see it right next to the heart of me  
Heard of me, the routine scar  
New cuts cover where the old ones are  
And now I'm sick of this  
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity  
I rather not even be then the man  
That's staring in the mirror through me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it  
Once it's been dealt with you feel like  
You've been touched by something angelic  
And then melted down into a pool of peace  
Cease to be the animal you used to be  
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong  
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone  
And then you start to see another piece  
Of yourself that you can't let be  
Memories of the last fight to free yourself  
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well  
And now you know that you can choose  
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise  
You can live if you're willing to  
Put a stop to just what's killing you  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

A part of me screams away silently  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
This part of me won't go away  
Part of me won't go away

Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be

And a DJ in the group just for credibility  
  
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes  
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines  
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer

And your record company is completely missing it  
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate  
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit

Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run  
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets  
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got  
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it  
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right  
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite  
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right  
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights  
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose

I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view

And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you  
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?  
It's like that  
  
We swim against the rising waves  
That crash against the shore  
The body bends until it breaks  
The early morning sings no more  
  
So rest your head  
It's time to sleep  
And dream of what's in store  
The body bends until it breaks  
And sings again no more  
'Cause time has torn the flesh away

Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt.  
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know

Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat  
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact

The rain before it's falling  
Maybe I'm a fool to even try  
  
But I can't say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay  
And I can't tell you why  
I know the feeling's gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just can't say goodbye  
  
Here I go  
Running after dreams and chasing rainbows  
Trying to hold on to your heart  
I made it through another lonely night  
Just thinking of you  
I long to be right where you are  
  
Maybe there's a way to stop  
The hands of time from turning  
Maybe it just hurts too much to try

In fields as they lay  
In fields where they may  
Keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night

Born

They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the East  
Beyond them far  
And to the Earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night

In those Wise men three  
Full reverently  
Upon their knee  
And offered there  
In His presence  
Their gold and myrrh  
And frankincense

Am I still not good enough?  
Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now  
Guess I'm still not good enough

Knowing I used all the pain?  
Does it hurt  
Knowing you're fuel to my flame?  
Don't look back  
Don't need your regrets  
Thank God you left my love behind  
Couldn't change me if you tried  
  
Am I still not good enough?  
Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now

Release your curse  
'Cause I know my worth  
Those wounds you made are gone  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
Your love wore thin  
And I never win  
You want the best  
So sorry that's clearly not me  
This is all I can be

Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now

What do you think  
  
You are my life  
I have to go on  
Havin' me any way you want me baby  
Just love me til the tension's gone  
And don't you come too soon  
  
I'm patient I never come too soon  
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune  
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom  
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room  
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix  
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed  
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks  
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed  
And I cherish you forever believe me you  
You's a priceless treasure from my point of view  
It took time to change I'll admit that  
My back in the days love I had to get back  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
And don't you come too soon  
(never that)  
  
I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again  
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend  
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons  
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom  
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves  
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave  
Now you ready I like that my love you save  
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave  
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete  
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet  
Back together reunited bonded once more  
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well now you know how I feel  
And I definitely know how you feel  
Word up  
I'm feelin' this  
Word up  
Cause wit' you by my side  
I'm a take it to the top yeah

Funky! Uh  
Yeah  
Yo, let me tell you bout a girl named Peg  
A D.C. haircut and stewardess legs  
Dressed to kill, her physique is ill  
Her face belongs on a dollar bill  
Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-be  
Driving around in a 300e  
Trunk jewelry and all that  
Talking bout, ""My man can't fall black!""  
Sipping on cham', diamonds on her hand  
Taking cash, carrying drugs for her man  
Driving around in a kitted up Jetta  
Under the seat a automatic Beretta  
You know, the whole blase blah of rap  
Telling brothers they need to get off the bra-strap  
That's the type of girl she is  
Word to Miz, she got the  
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box  
Big rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes  
The type of girl that cold did son wrong  
She got the face that you want to spend money on  
Her man be smacking her up  
Yeah, backing her up  
To the wall, get undressed, where you going?  
You ain't playing me out with that hoeing  
Look in the mirror, check the jewels  
Silly rabbit, you know the rules  
But he had to leave on another deal  
So she's out there with sex appeal  
It's the weekend, time for freaking, she's sneaking  
Outside, telling her home girls, we can  
Do the do, with who-ever we want to  
Cause we're the fly girl crew  
Not knowing her man messed up the money  
Riding around, thinking everything's funny  
Went in a disco, came outside  
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride  
She had to pay for her man's mistakes  
They shot her in the head  
That's the breaks

LL Cool J,Hey Lover,/l/ll+cool+j/hey+lover_20081085.html,"I've been watching you from a far  
For as long as I can remember  
You're all a real man could need  
And could ever ask for  
This is more than a crush  
Yeah  
  
It was Harlem at the ruckus  
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh  
A coach bag in your hand  
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back  
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that  
  
So I skated off as you strolled off  
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)  
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission  
If his love is real he's got to handle competition  
You only knew him five months, (that's right)  
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts  
  
And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you  
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view  
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact  
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back  
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears  
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush, lover  
Hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
  
I see you at the bus stop waiting every day  
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way  
And I don't want to violate your relationship  
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip  
  
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams  
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream  
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight  
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night  
  
I wonder one day could it be, (how I wonder)  
Simple dreams could turn into reality  
Our love would come down so naturally  
We would walk down the aisle of destiny  
  
Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared  
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair  
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs  
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead, hey lover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last week I saw ya at the mall  
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call  
I had a vision it was me on the other end  
Telling you come by and then you walked in  
  
I touched you gently with my hands  
We talked about traveling the distant lands  
Escaping all the madness out here in the world  
Becoming my wife no longer my girl  
  
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor (oh yeah)  
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more  
We experienced pleasure unparalleled  
Into an ocean of love we both fell  
  
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss  
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss  
Undying passion unites our souls  
Together we swim until the point of no control  
  
But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true  
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you  
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, (that's right)  
Keep my dreams alive until the right time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't nothing like a fantasy kid  
Words up  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover

I was swerving thru Queens  
Fully growin' benz  
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system  
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec  
Rappin' to my mens  
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly  
My shit is  
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow  
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice  
Crease my scar peice  
Laid back in my seat  
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets  
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge  
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college  
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne  
She lived on the southside, so bring things on  
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop  
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks  
  
Your carmake me hot hot hot

Check this out, uh  
  
She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York  
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk  
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat  
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that  
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde  
Scooby dooby hizza  
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit  
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh  
I've got her right where I want her  
Reality about to creep up on her  
Stroke her softly, gently with my G  
While the light reflects off my icp  
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer  
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer  
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop  
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

You burst out of semi-???  
She pulled down the staps to her dress  
Reached in the ? sparked up sess  
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??  
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,  
and give up girl to push whips?""  
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone  
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone  
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????  
Give deep ? to ? man coats  
Take off my ??  
Drop to my knees""  
Talking in my face  
Breath smelling like cheese  
I asked her  
Shorty you degrade yourself  
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf  
You turnin' me off, I can't lie  
Keisha said ""why?""  
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,  
then he correct that""  
Ice is the price for an overnight wife  
A true shark caller don't want that in his life  
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls  
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold  
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll,  
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size

Starin' at the high ceiling, what a feeling  
Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing

My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me  
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all  
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall  
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?  
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas  
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms  
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom

All out, putting heads to bed  
'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed  
Wisdom, son, I rose in the east  
Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's

Strictly business, strictly business  
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop  
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more  
Gotta make it to the top  
  
Everything we do, gotta be brand new  
The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake  
Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team  
Big plans that'll make us the best  
'Cause we can rule this game we all play  
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday  
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel  
From now on, I'ma make my dreams real  
On a mission, gotta get there  
If you want to rule, you gotta be in there  
Our masterplan is the best  
And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest  
'Cause this is the reason we was born  
To rock on and on and on and on  
Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing  
Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags  
Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags  
Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate  
Pass anybody that stops to get gas  
Forever and a day, my destiny's set  
No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets  
Hold on tight, if not, get blown away  
Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say  
Radical things to get a champion's ring  
Give it up, punk, don't make me swing  
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread  
Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red  
So when it comes to like taking charge  
Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar  
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop  
With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's

of the man who can, so understand god damn  
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new  
way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size  
to realize LL's back  
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat  
a lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time  
with weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme  
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough  
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna  
You don't really wanna  
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson, stop 'fessin  
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin  
off the stage, and outta my face  
You're too light ? save the bass

On the microphone I'm not your average man  
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes  
and then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine  
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets  
then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz  
You don't know what I'm sayin? Yo check it  
Give me any microphone and god dammit I'll wreck it!  
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate  
Last year before I left I told you to wait  
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray  
Thinking Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J  
Is you crazy? I'm booming, got the talent of two men  
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men  
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier  
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!

Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied  
Brawl for all give a lyrical display

Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""

I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""  
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones  
cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done  
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""  
but the rest they be sucking on sugar smacks  
Talking that crap about who's better than me  
You think so? Just let a MC  
make me mad enough, to really wanna battle  
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme  
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""  
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild  
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles  
like tripling up the words, confusing all the nerds  
Heard put my sights on mics and ? flipping above the word  
to the mother, no other  
MC brother, can mess with Ladies Lover  
I'm original, I'm bright under color  
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber  
Can't stand criticism, give 'em an exorcism  
Been rocking for years, now I have wisdom  
The way I'm kicking the lines you can hear my tongue twist  
and it'll have your neck spinning like you're spineless  
I'm picking 'em up, throwing 'em down  
Hyping 'em up and slowing 'em down  
All of these words with only one tongue  
Shaking 'em up and then baking 'em up  
Smash boom bash scraping 'em up  
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun  
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone  
And take control just like Al Capone  
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me  
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me  
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt  
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt  
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines  
and a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme

Shards beneath our feet  
But it wasn't my fault

Cause what this palace wants is release

And you know we're on each other's team

It's not the same as when I was punched  
In the old days there was enough  
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood  
I was in but I want out  
My mother's love is choking me  
I'm sick of words that hang above my head  
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you

I joined the club and it's all on  
There are fights for being my best friend  
And the girls get their claws out  
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids  
Take the pill make it too ill  
The other day I forgot my old address  
I'm sitting pretty on the throne  
There's nothing more I want  
Except to be alone  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
You'll get punched for the love club  
For the love club  
  
Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go  
So drop your chin and take yourself back home  
And roll out your maps and papers  
Find out your hiding places again  
The only problem that I got with the club  
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up  
When you're a member go on your great adventure again  
They will be waiting at the end  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
You'll get punched for the love club

It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me  
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire  
And my necklace is of rope, i tie it and untie it

I'm speeding up and this is the  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
We're at the start, the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars there's so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds  
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now  
People talk to me, and all their faces blur  
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison  
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me

In a cabin, on a hill in butcher holler.  
We were poor but we had love,  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Van ]Lear coal mines.  
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.  
Mommy rocked the babies at night,  
And read the bible by the coal oil light,  
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.  
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed,  
To complain, there was no need,  
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.  
  
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.  
But in the wintertime we all got a brand new pair.  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from selling a hog,  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.  
  
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,  
I remember well, the well where I drew water.  
The work we done was hard,  
At night we'd sleep cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving butcher holler.  
  
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then  
And it feels so good to be back home again.  
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore,  
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day

I'm gonna praise my Saviour's name everyday that I'm livin'  
Glory hallelujah I'm not ashamed to let the salvation show  
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go

When he gathers his sheep I wanna be as white as snow

Loretta Lynn,I'm A Honky Tonk Girl,/l/loretta+lynn/im+a+honky+tonk+girl_20254791.html,"Ever since you left me I've done nothing but wrong.  
Many nights I've laid awake and cried.  
We was so happy.  
My heart was in a whirl,  
But now I'm a honky tonk girl.  
So turn that jukebox way up high,  
And fill my glass up while I cry.  
I've lost everything in this world,  
And now I'm a honky tonk girl.  
(Instrumental)  
I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs,  
Every evening of my life seems so long,  
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see,  
But losing him has made a fool of me.  
So fill my glass up to the rim,  
To lose my memory of him,  
I've lost everything in this world,  
And now I'm a Honky Tonk Girl

Though his reputations talk about but he don't hide a thing  
He lives the way he wants to live and that's how he should be  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
Yes I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
I'll be contented in his loving arms eternaly  
For could he give me more than love how richer could I be  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
[ steel - piano ]  
Yes we have a lot in common and that's more than others have  
Take you preachin' out for something but there's nothing there to brag  
His love is all he has to give but he gives it all to me  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
Yes I'm all he's got...

Loretta Lynn,I'm Dynamite,/l/loretta+lynn/im+dynamite_20703038.html,"I know you see that don't touch sun all over me  
My pain is wet and you'll get hurt all over you  
I'm another man's woman to you I'm just bad news  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You turn me on but I can't turn me off I guess the switch is burried in my
mind  
The flame of love is burning just begging to be used  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You cannot do the damage that I'll do and the first thing I'll destroy it will
be you  
Too many other hearts and vows that I can't stand to lose  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
[ dobro ]  
You cannot do the damage...  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse

So I made up my mind and my face and I'm goin to town  
I'm gonna pay you back by doin you the way you've done me  
And some dude don't know how lucky he's about to be  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
I'm gonna make his day, if it takes me all night long  
I'm gonna pick him up, love him up, and really come on strong  
I'm gonna do somebody right, I'm gonna break your heart tonight  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
  
I'm gonna give you just what you deserve  
Cause the crime sure fit's the sentence you must serve  
Then I'm gonna make it twice as hard on you I know because  
I'm gonna come back in the morning and tell you how it was

Loretta Lynn,I'm Living In Two Worlds,/l/loretta+lynn/im+living+in+two+worlds_20702932.html,"I'm living in two worlds dividing my time  
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine  
  
When I'm in your world I just pretend  
That I'm really happy though I don't fit in  
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone  
I'm living in two worlds where do I belong  
I'm living in two worlds...  
  
Old friends in your world are new friends to me  
So I can't take part in your old memories  
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same  
We both have our own worlds and neither can change  
I'm living in two worlds...

I tried all I know to do to leave trouble behind  
I can hardly live without him I even miss the fights  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
And I ache for troubles arms to hold me tight  
Everytime we get together seems like nothin' comes out right  
Lord I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
[ steel ]  
Unhappy when I'm with him I'm unhappy when I'm not  
I've tried so hard to get along but trouble's all I've got  
It's hard to have somebody on your mind but out of sight  
Yes I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight...
