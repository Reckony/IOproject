Oh, grains are the foundation, so please take my advice  
Have five to eleven servings of bread, cereal, or rice  
Three to five of vegitables, and four of fruits is best  
Thier anti-oxidents and fiber help you to digest  
Three servings of yogurt, milk, and cheese  
Will help your bones and subsidise the cattle industry

Desire. Deceit. Control.  
It's killing you for everyone.  
Just stick around until I'm gone.  
I love you so it hurts.  
For whatever that is worth.  
  
And no time will fade away,  
The rumors and the lies.  
And no one will remember,  
If you even said goodbye.  
  
What's the point in dying,  
When the world thinks you're already dead?  
What's the point in crying,  
With the rain beating down on your head?  
  
Greed. Hate. Lust.  
Divide. Disgust. Distrust.  
Happiness comes in a pill,  
From a fifteen-story windowsill.  
You'll love me till I die,  
Or at least until I try.  
  
The after words don't mean a thing,  
The problems still persist.  
Don't think about the stories,  
And the bullshit that you missed.  
  
What's the point in dying,  
When the world thinks you're already dead?  
What's the point in crying,  
With the rain beating down on your head?  
What's the point in lying,  
If no one believes what you say?  
What's the point in dying,  
If you're already dead anyway?  
  
If you're already dead anyway.  
If you're already dead anyway.  
  
I hope you will remember me.  
At least say so, to comfort me.  
You say goodbye so easily.  
It's now or never.  
It may seem really pitiful.  
But life became too beautiful.  
The pain of love unbearable.  
It's now or never.  
Gone forever.

Marilyn Manson,The Telephone,/m/marilyn+manson/the+telephone_20488910.html,"The Telephone  
Another night of too much cough syrup  
I'm awakened by the incessant ringing of a telephone  
I still have dreams caked in the corners of my eyes  
And my mouth is dry and tastes shitty  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Slowly I bustle out of bed  
The remnants of an erection still lingering in my shorts  
Like a bothersome guest  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Carefully I abscond to the bathroom  
As to not display my manhood to others  
There I make the perfunctory morning faces  
Which always seem to precede my daily contribution  
To the once-blue toilet water  
That I always enjoy making green  
  
Again the ringing  
  
I shake twice like most others  
And I'm annoyed by the dribble that always seems to remain  
Causing a small acreage of wetness on the front of my briefs  
I slowly languidly, lazily, crazily,  
Stumble into the den  
Where my father smokes his guitars  
I mean cigars  
In his easy chair  
I know all about easy chairs  
And then I sing a song for my friends  
  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
You can't have him  
Because jesus is my boyfriend  
  
Ringing ringing  
Dang it goddamn motherfucking son-of-a-bitch is ringing  
I walk into the kitchen and I  
Stare blankly at that shrieking plastic bastard  
Since it keeps ringing I know it's her  
And since it keeps ringing she knows it's me  
  
We are the world, we are the children  
We are the ones who make a darker day  
So let's start killing  
There's a choice you're making  
We're sparing our own lives  
It's true we'll make a darker day  
Just you and me

Kicking up the rain or the sand in the sun

You can discover every part of me

And I think of all the things, what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home,  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
Won't you come on over  
Stop making a fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over Valerie?

And the dampness of tears that left  
The stain where you had wept

I'm afraid it's far too much  
Cook a meal and fix up the place  
Dial your number, hang it up

I apologize for acting tough  
You're my reason for living  
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one  
That you got someone new  
Yeah, I see but don't believe it  
Even in my head you're still in my bed

Gracefully wasting away

Who is gonna be her everything?

She foolishly tries to convince herself that she'll be fine  
She blows all her kisses to none  
As the phone rings again, she just closes her eyes  
She covers her ears and screams ""please not today!""

Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says  
Hello  
  
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely  
They got no faith in you  
But I've got a feeling, you still owe me  
So wipe from your shoes  
  
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day  
Nobody ever seems to remember, the life is a game we play  
  
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away  
And it's never gonna be the same  
'Cause the years are fallin' by like the rain  
It's never gonna be the same  
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says  
Hello, hello  
  
Hello, hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Oh yeah

Don't I?  
  
[Chorus]  
I parked my car outside your house  
Hope that someday you'll come home  
Seems the woman that I love  
Is someone that I hardly know  
And after all this time  
I've finally found a way to be alone  
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind  
  
Shy girl, so humble  
With eyes that make me stumble  
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything  
I go out, you eat in  
Hide from the situation  
You're naked in daylight  
Wrap yourself up and goodnight  
  
I'm burning, I'm hungry  
Angry 'cause she don't love me  
You've got me completely  
In my own game, you beat me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will be back again  
No this is not the end  
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in  
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget  
The tears that you shed  
I'll make it impossible to let go

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow  
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand  
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow  
So let's get drunk on our tears  
  
And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  
  
Who are we?  
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?  
Woe is me  
If we're not careful turns into reality  
  
But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow  
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer  
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending  
Where we're dancing in our tears

It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run

I'm no different than you  
I just believe what I do  
  
You point your finger at  
Everyone but yourself  
And blame the ones that you love  
Who are only trying to help  
  
As it's winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
I'll see this through  
There's so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever

Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done  
No curtain call, I will not fall  
This may be the one we've been waiting for  
No curtain call, just take it all  
  
I have no time for fear  
Or people in my ear  
Head down and running so fast  
Try not to dwell on the past  
  
I'm fighting through this pain  
And things I cannot change  
Running right into the flame  
Rather than running away  
  
As it's winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
I'll see this through  
There's so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever

Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet  
You turn up the heat  
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep  
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

Driving slow on Sunday morning

Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you  
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.  
Find a way to bring myself back home to you  
  
That may be all I need

Come and rest your bones with me  
Driving slow on Sunday morning  
Driving slow  
  
It's flower in your hair  
I'm a flower in your hair

As far as an eternity  
Outstretched arms, open hearts  
And if it never ends then when do we start?  
I'll never leave you behind  
Or treat you unkind  
I know you understand  
And with a tear in my eye  
Give me the sweetest goodbye  
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back  
Bring me closer to heart attack  
Say goodbye and just fly away  
When you come back  
I have some things to say  
  
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone  
When you get home  
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go  
So I can show you how I  
  
Dream away everyday  
Try so hard to disregard  
The rhythm of the rain that drops  
And coincides with the beating of my heart  
  
I'll never leave you behind  
Or treat you unkind  
I know you understand  
And with a tear in my eye  
Give me the sweetest goodbye  
That I ever did receive

Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

Worth all of the pain that I have gone through

And we're only several miles from the sun.""

The perfection of her creation  
The sex she slipped into my coffee

Back and forth and here and gone

In a jar next to my bed  
And if i should ever draw a picture of a woman  
It is you  
That would come flowing through my pen  
  
Leaving your clothes on the floor  
Making me walk out the door  
And i still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Ow  
  
Helplessly melting  
As i stand next to the sun  
As you burn me  
I am screaming out for more  
Drink every drop of liquid  
In the heat that I've become  
Pop me open  
Spoon me out onto the floor  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
Fail to understand  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Yeah

Mary Black,A Stones Throw From The Soul,/m/mary+black/a+stones+throw+from+the+soul_20089907.html,"Love showed me it's riches late last spring  
Took me to it's breast and gave me wings  
I truly did believe  
And still I was deceived  
Love made me it's witness one fine spring  
  
Life seemed dark and beautiful at once  
All mixed upside down and back to front  
It was hard to know what's what  
The light went on and off  
Life was stark and plentiful at once  
  
Maybe time really does heal wounds  
Maybe love doesn't know  
A mere heartbeat from happiness  
A stone's throw from the soul  
  
Days lived with a will  
Days as fine as can be  
Days grace on my morning pillow  
Days I'm longing to see  
  
Sunlight blows the winter one last kiss  
Me I hold my breath and make my wish  
We live through thick and thin  
Where evil sometimes wins  
Me I try my best and think of this  
  
That maybe time really does heal wounds  
And maybe love doesn't know  
A mere heartbeat from happiness  
A stone's throw from the sould

Mary Black,Adam At The Window,/m/mary+black/adam+at+the+window_20089883.html,"Adam's at the window staring at the apple trees on fire  
Waiting for the windfall that brings the smile of kings and their desire  
Door blows in behind him, a floral pattern, summer dress so gay  
Burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
  
Adam's on the island, living in the land of love  
Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love  
Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more  
And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup  
The son of a swan will then loose his plumera  
And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town  
And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down  
And call his lovers down  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
Will have his way  
  
Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray  
Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day  
Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again  
He's burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown

I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams  
The games you've been playing  
Weren't quite what they seemed  
How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall

And your dreams will flame and in the fire play

No smiling faces lined for you to meet

From the kind side of the street

Giving guidance with its light  
But I had no one to return to  
As I wander through life  
From the first time that I saw you  
Standing silent by the shore  
I knew my search was over  
And I would look for love no more  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
There is a ship on the horizon  
Making its way against the wind  
And from the place where I stand watching  
I swear my ship is coming in  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone

And heaven has its way  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes  
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails  
  
And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails  
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right  
Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night  
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark  
  
That somehow this black night  
Feels warmer for the spark  
Warmer for the spark  
To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip  
  
And heaven has its way  
And heaven has its way  
When all will harmonise  
And know it's in our hearts  
  
The dream will realise  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes

Mary Black,Nobody Lives Without Love,/m/mary+black/nobody+lives+without+love_20089944.html,"Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldn't be sure I was even alive  
Fallen from the icy heights  
Landed with a broken cry  
In this valley of shadows and sorrow and sighs  
Can you save me baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody lives without love  
Nobody gets to give up  
You can try to lock your heart away  
But love will come back for you some day  
Nobody lives without love  
  
Thought I could live out my life as a stranger  
Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings  
Make it to the higher ground  
Try to turn the volume down  
Couldn't stop the sirens from singing  
Sing for me baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You came along like a flash of pure lightning  
Crashed into my life like a runaway star  
Feel myself falling like gravity's angel  
Now I'm standing here offering a stranger my heart

Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldn't be sure I was even alive

All we can do is to trace it  
See where we go to, know where we've been  
Build up the courage to face it  
While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light  
Roaming the land of the ancients  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died  
  
While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight  
Searching for trees in the forest

I hope you won't turn on your heel or walk away

But facing up can be so much better  
So what if dreams, they all come to nothing?

He said he'd see me home that night but home I never saw  
He kept beside me all the while resolved to have his will  
And by and by we lost our way, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For when we got to Rare's Hill, the laddie said to me  
We can't go home tonight my dear, it's far to late you'll see  
But the night is warm and in my bush, I've got another drill  
And we can lie down here, content, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For then he poured a nipper piece to quiet all alarm  
When I awoke in the morning we were locked in each other's arms  
He handed me the bottle, another glass to fill  
And I drank his heath, in store o'wealth, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
And then the lad he said to me, ""Oh lassie do not mourn""  
""For while I draw the breath of life from you I'll never harm""  
""If you will come to yonder town, my wedded wife you'll be""  
""we'll be the happiest couple t'was ever in Dundee""  
  
So it's may I never prosper, and may I never thrive

Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away

It took a lot of pleading, but he came here after all  
And Ben's the very boy to take us right to where we want  
Hey, look at them couples linking through the rainy streets  
Someplace to be in love, the best there'll ever be  
Oh sister sadness, get yourself behind me  
Oh brother badness, why must you deny me?  
It doesn't matter where I've gone  
I'm on the run like everyone  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
We're tearing up the town

I juggle with the breakfast, you fret behind the sheets

Oh my pretty darling, where did we go astray  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay.  
We're all dollied up for the circus, oh isn't it grand  
We're laughing, jumping and kissing, we're beating the band.  
I've got no more smiles to win you, no tricks to turn your head  
When love cannot continue, there's not much to be said.

It's all cut and thrust at the circus, and maybe makes three  
You're twisting my words into serpents, I'm down on my knees.  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay  
I thought you'd come to stay, I thought you'd come to stay.

It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations  
With adventures for the stout of heart, And the lure of the open spaces.  
  
There's two lanes running down this road, And whichever side you are on  
Accounts for where you want to go, And what you are running from  
Back when darkness overtook me, On a blindman's curve.

For being such a stubborn woman, In such stubborn times  
I have run from the arms of lovers, I have run from the eyes of friends  
I have run from the hands of kindness, I have run just because I can.  
  
Now I've grown and I speak like a woman, And I see with a woman's eyes  
And an open door is to me now, Like the saddest of goodbyes  
Well it's too late for turning back, And I pray for the heart and nerve

So we show the parts we feel are best,  
we squirm around the edges trying to cover up the rest.  
You think you know him and he thinks the same,

Win or lose it's just the same  
tears of joy tears of pain  
They're hand in hand, they come as one  
you'll never see the moon without the promise of the sun  
For all the bruises for all the blows  
I'd rather feel the thorn than to never see the rose

It hovered in a frozen sky and gobbled summer down

And shivering trees are standing in a naked row  
I get the urge for going, but I never seem to go  
  
I had someone in the summertime with summer-colored skin  
And not another one in town my darling's heart could win  
And when the leaves fell tumbling down  
And bully winds did rub their faces in the snow  
He got the urge for going, and I had to let him go  
  
Well, he got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
Summertime is a-falling down  
Winter's closing in  
  
And the warriors of winter gave a cold, triumphant shout  
All that stays is dying, and all that lives is getting out  
You see the geese in chevron flight  
A-flapping and a-racing on before the snow  
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings to go  
  
They've got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
Summertime is a-falling down  
Winter's closing in  
  
I'll pile the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin  
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and bolt my wandering in

And let her stay for just another month or so  
But she's got the urge for going, and I'll have to let her go

But if you could examine the goods they bring  
They have little to offer but the songs they sing  
And the plentiful waste of time of day

And the tide of Your great love come rushing in.

When the lost began to sing of

A mighty river through the nations  
When young and old return to Jesus.  
Fling wide, you heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play,  
Let the streets resound with singing.  
Songs that bring Your hope, and  
Songs that bring Your joy.  
Dancers who dance upon injustice.

When all the saints join in one song,  
And all the streams flow as one river,  
To wash away our brokenness?

A time of jubilee is coming,  
When young and old return to Jesus.

And see Your perfect kingdom come on earth, on the earth.  
  
Yes and amen, we?re taking up our cross for You,  
Give us the strength to take these dreams and follow through.

On a half shell, they're the heroes, four  
In this day and age who could ask for more?  
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious  
Our police and detective are furious  
'Cause they can't find the source  
Of this lethally evil force  
This is serious, so give me a quarter  
I was a witness, get me a reporter  
Call April O'Neil in on this case, and  
You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste  
We need help, like quick, on the double  
Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble  
We need heroes like the lone ranger

Now, our miss reporter was hot on the trail  
Determined to put these crooks in jail  
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened  
But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught  
Yeah, she was all alone  
With no friends and no phone  
Now, this was beyond her worst dreams  
'Cause she was concerned by some wayward teens  
Headed by shredder, they were anything but good  
Misguided, unloved, they called them, the foot  
They could terrorize and be angry youth, and  
They mugged the people who needed proof?  
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound  
Shouted, ""Cowabunga"", as they hit the ground  
From the field of weeds, the heroes rescued the flower  
'Cause they possessed

And find the strength to do what's right?  
That's turtle power  
Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission  
When there's a battle, got the enemy wishin'  
That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'  
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin'  
They were once normal but now they're mutants  
Splinter's the teacher, so, they are the students  
Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Donatello  
Make up this group with one other follow  
Raphael, he's the leader of the group  
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop  
Pizza's the food, that's sure to please  
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese  
Back to the story, it's not hard to find  
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind  
These are the words that their master instructed  
But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted  
That was the last straw, spring into action  
Step on the foot, now they're gonna lose traction  
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice  
Your shell is hard, so you shout, ""They can't dust us"", four  
Like some old coffee table  
Since you were young, you've been willing and able  
To defeat the snake, protect the weak  
Fight for rights and the freedom to speak  
Now the villain is showin', so you take a stand

You talk about a show that's hyped and tight  
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a mic

And I am not ashamed of my life  
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road  
I've always felt you deep in my bones  
  
With every step I rise and fall  
With everything to gain I end up losing it all  
When the darkness gets in  
I scream out and your light sets me free  
  
I'm not afraid of the past no more  
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good  
I used to dance to the devil's beat  
If I could bust into hell I would  
  
I'm not afraid to shed all my skin  
I'm not afraid of the faults you see  
I'm tearing down these walls right now  
They're comin' down 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
I'm not afraid when they kick me down  
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed  
I'm not afraid if I live or die  
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
And I wish that I could give you something in return  
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned  
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned  
  
And in the end you'll finally see  
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can  
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need  
  
I'm not afraid of the the truth no more  
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid  
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins  
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did  
  
I'm not afraid of the things you know  
I'm just a book for the world to read  
My final words on the final page  
Will be amends 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that

And begging you, ""come home.""

Knowing that it might make me cry  
I don't want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting  
I stumbled on ""I love you"" tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye

To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got then find  
That you've already changed your mind

Meat Loaf,Don't You Look At Me Like That,/m/meat+loaf/dont+you+look+at+me+like+that_20091303.html,"I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes  
Like a little girl I once knew  
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street  
You walk with me, and I walk with you  
  
Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense  
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart

Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again  
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again  
And it just can't be, like it was once before  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
(No, I never could turn away from you)

Standin' there with bibles clutched in their hand

And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch

There's a beauty of a moon in the sky  
But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life  
You never lift your head and look so high  
  
You don't have a lot

But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now

It ain't fair

Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere

On you skin in the dark  
And your desperate now for somewhere to turn

Every nerve is on edge  
And every limb is being erotically burned

I can't believe how hard it's been to  
Conjure up your face and trace your body in the air  
All the seconds go on forever  
But the thirds and the forth ones are even better  
And every time I do it just a little bit longer  
Every time I dream, it's just a little bit stronger than  
Real life

I guess you couldn't get it from me  
Whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress

And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!  
But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight

Batten down, baby, lock all doors

Your hait's so straight, I can make it curl  
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl

One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart

Just leave me alone

Making love to you all night long  
I used to take you in my arms  
And hold you there until all my strength was gone

And we both lived here  
Guess you were living alone

And I would build you a bridge  
So you could come back

And I used to take you in my arms

Now you can't tear my world apart  
  
I used to be a man of steel  
Now every bit of faith is gone  
You used to be so strong  
Now you can't even break my heart

I used to take you in my arms  
What's it going to take for us to break down?

Meat Loaf,Not A Dry Eye In The House,/m/meat+loaf/not+a+dry+eye+in+the+house_20091350.html,"Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
I can still see you standing there.  
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair.  
Kisses sweet in the salty air.  
When love was forever.  
Turn the page and we fade to blue.  
The scene has changed now I'm without you.  
Walked away when the act was through.  
And the dream was over.  
It was almost like a movie  
The way you said goodbye.  
You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
The greatest story was you and me.  
Had it all we had everything, but now the.  
Story's done it's just history.  
The last act is over.  
You every line had the sweetest sound.  
Your every touch turned my world around.  
But the light came up and my world crashed down.  
End of show  
It's over.  
It was almost like a movie.  
Those nights we touched the stars.  
Time stood still for you and I.  
Now it's sad enough to make you cry.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Act one  
The story's just begun.  
Act two  
I fell in love with you.  
Act three  
Knew it was meant to be.  
Act four  
You don't love me no more.  
And there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.

Meat Loaf,Nowhere Fast,/m/meat+loaf/nowhere+fast_20091235.html,"It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day  
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away  
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like  
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back  
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away  
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack  
We're breakin' away from the pack  
  
And if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And even if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly  
They're only fighting for the chance to be last  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
  
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast  
  
You shouldn't always see your world so clearly  
You shouldn't always know your place so well  
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell  
  
I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day  
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away  
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose  
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

We'll break the silence of the night  
And you know they're gonna hear us comin'  
We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk  
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark  
  
So baby one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
We never have to say goodbye  
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
  
Artists got their easels, they're ready on the mark  
Gonna try and take the pictures  
Of the dust and the gold in the sparks  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'

Sleepin' city urban fall,  
Summer's sadness time to answer the call  
Cool machine, get it runnin', ready to roll  
Soft hands around my neck,  
One more kiss then it's time to connect  
Leave this child, leave me all alone,  
This one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
Ready, ready, ready to roll - this one's mine and I'm takin' it home

Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie

I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away  
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around

If I could only find a voice I would speak  
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream  
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold  
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

Read 'em and weep, for the dreams we'll ignore  
Running silent and deep,  
And all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the magic that our bodies had made  
Read 'em and weep, for the blood that we lost  
Running silent and deep, and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed  
For whatever the cost  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the memories still alive in the bed  
Read 'em and weep, for the lies we believed  
Running silent and deep, and all the things that can never be said  
  
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep  
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
I rose up on the doctor's slab  
Like Lazarus from the pit  
And everyone wants to take a stab  
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit  
  
I've been held up on money  
I've been beaten out of spite  
You want a piece of me honey?  
Lose or win  
  
You know you've been in a fight

You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell  
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the  
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too  
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the  
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,  
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it  
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.  
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than  
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So  
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew  
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings  
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and  
Tear him down.  
  
Now there ain't much difference  
Between a bridge and a wall  
Without me right in the middle baby  
You'll be nothing at all  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down

Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight  
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow  
And a sweet young thing called out my name  
And this is how it goes, she says...  
""Go boy, can you hear them?  
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?""

Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide  
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside  
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore  
You've got to walk before you run  
See the night before dawn  
Before you pull yourself off the floor

And feeling empty  
Desperate  
  
I had my head in a noose  
I had nothing to loose  
Had enough of abuse  
And now I'm dangerous  
Hateful, contagious

The monsters loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove you can take it  
To the top before you fall

Felt a twitch in my soul  
Through the wind and the cold  
With no protection  
Just one direction  
Destruction  
  
I've paid for all my mistakes  
Taking all I can take  
Until I'm ready to break  
I'm feeling vicious  
And so outrageous  
It breaks us  
  
I'm leaving  
Still breathing  
I'm tearing through these chains

I've lived a thousand years in darkness  
Banished all alone  
Inside my mind with just my madness  
Behind these walls of stone  
  
I was falling apart at the seams  
Holding my breath just to breathe  
I tasted the sting of my tears  
  
I was waking up stuck in a dream  
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed  
Wasted away by my fears  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove that you can take it  
To the top and never fall  
  
The monster's loose  
You've lost your last excuse  
Now show me that you got it  
Even when you fall  
  
The monster's loose

Sometimes you gotta' do it  
And show the world you want it all

Right away I bought me a through train ticket, ridin' across Mississippi clean

Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston Town  
There are people there who care a little 'bout me

Meat Loaf,Wasted Youth,/m/meat+loaf/wasted+youth_20091300.html,"Wasted Youth  
Wasted Youth  
I remember everything!  
I remember everything little thing, as if it happened yesterday  
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny
angel  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy  
  
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords  
And the precise angle from which to strike!  
  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berry's  
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
But it rung out beautifully  
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before  
  
So I took my guitar  
And I smashed it against the wall  
I smashed it against the floor  
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader  
Smashed it against the hood of a car  
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson  
The Harley howled in pain  
The guitar howled in heat  
  
And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom  
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight  
Slowly I opened the door  
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed  
I raised the guitar high above my head  
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of
the bed  
My father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""  
""Wait a minute. Stop it boy. What do you think your doing?""  
""That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""  
And I said, ""God Damn It daddy,""  
""You know I love you, But you've got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n'
Roll""

Did the moon drift too far from sight?  
I would search through this empty darkness  
To see your face in the morning light  
  
We've been lost in a sea of confusion  
Got caught up in a selfish illusion  
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break  
Don't let fate make the choice for us  
  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?

What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?

For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe  
In a love that's meant to be

Given up on the higher thing  
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find  
Something to give us wings

To live without you  
Is reaching for something that never comes through  
Together is heaven  
Apart we're in hell  
The time for forgiveness is now  
  
Once in a lifetime you'll find  
Someone to share your dreams  
For a lifetime  
Our love will always set us free  
Forever we'll believe...

And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

I'll always love you but just not like that  
Like what?  
I want to be honest with you I met someone else  
You did what?  
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you  
Remember the time that I told you that  
I was going out of town for business?  
Well I went to see him  
You know what? You suck!  
  
Goodbye 1000 times  
You'll always have a special place  
In my heart you know that  
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over  
Goodbye 1000 times  
Things may not work out with him  
Goodbye 1000 times  
And if they don't  
Goodbye 1000 times  
Then I'll certainly call you  
Goodbye 1000 times  
You mean a lot to me  
I still really want to be friends with you  
I love you like you're my brother

Full throttle, hit the ground running

And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line

I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green  
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car  
Heavily sedated with thousands of round  
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons  
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight  
Hot blood running cold as ice  
Forty four minutes of target practice  
All hell's breaking loose  
Outgunned, watching ""The Force"" come to a firefight with a pocketknife  
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel  
And brought down the beast!!!  
  
This was an accident waiting to happen  
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when  
The city's people sabotaged themselves  
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense  
  
The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped  
Standard police issue guns were just not enough  
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight  
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Blood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it  
  
Drink from the chalice and be reborn  
And the land with me, it will change and transform  
  
A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget  
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath  
Good and evil, there never is one without the other, his brother  
Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders  
  
The futures taken root in the present son  
Don't look into my heart, least of all your own  
  
No man who is false can win in combat against the truth  
When he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lost  
Hearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet done  
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled  
  
Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings  
The Necromancer's hard teachings of war and quest  
  
I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice  
I have lived through others for far too long,  
And carried my guilt, my causes, my sins  
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future  
That I can be just a man

Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam.  
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream.  
Your life is like a trigger, never troubled till you're squeezed.  
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease.  
Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin.  
Load another bullets, now the second round begins.  
A couple grains of power, a couple grams of lead.  
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head.  
Take another drink and raise the last bets.  
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said.  
A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail.  
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill.  
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still.  
Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill.  
Add another bullet, the third round begins.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
Please, no IOUs no markers for death.  
Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play?  
You, you! Next victim! You, next to die.

Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
  
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins  
The end is closing in  
Feeding on the minds of man  
And from their souls within  
My disciples all shout to search out  
And they always shall obey  
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild  
But do just as I say  
  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
  
Jump by your will or be taken by force  
I'll get you either way  
Trying to keep the hellfire lit  
I am stalking you as prey  
Living your life as me I am you you see  
There is part of me in everyone  
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land  
Come home where you belong  
  
So come on  
Jump in the fire  
So come on  
Jump in the fire

But can't look forward to reveal  
Look to the time when I'll live

I can feel the pain  
  
Wait for the sign  
To flick the switch of death  
It's the beginning of the end  
  
Sweat, chilling cold  
As I watch death unfold  
Consciousness my only friend  
  
My fingers grip with fear  
What I am doing here?  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Someone help me  
Oh please God help me  
They're trying to take it all away  
I don't want to die  
  
Time moving slow  
The minutes seem like hours  
The final curtain call I see  
  
How true is this?  
Just get it over with  
If this is true, just let it be  
  
Wakened by horrid screams  
Freed from this frightening dream  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain

We all came out to Montreux  
On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn't have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
They burned down the gamblin' house,  
It died with an awful sound  
A funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
We ended up at the Grand Hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know, I know we'll never forget  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water

Michael Bolton,Once In A Lifetime,/m/michael+bolton/once+in+a+lifetime_20092528.html,"People fill their lives, with empty nights,  
And days that slip away  
Some search till the end of time, but never find,  
The open arms of fate  
One moment comes along, someone who's a dream to you,  
All at once your dreams come true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Once in a lifetime, you find the one you really love  
For now and forever, one love that never ends  
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky  
Will shine with one reason, leading your heart to the one love you find  
Just once in a lifetime  
  
Some people live their lives in compromise,  
And hide their dreams away  
Some never take the chance, within their hands,  
To claim the prize they make  
When faith is all you need, to hold the hand of destiny,  
Find the love that's meant to be  
  
[Chorus]  
If you believe in the power of love  
And you believe that dreams come true  
Magic will fill your heart, when that moment comes along  
Just once in a lifetime  
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky  
Will shine with one reason, leading you home to the one love you find  
Just once in a lifetime, Just once in a lifetime

Werther is madly in love with Charlotte, his friends wife. To forget her, he
has run away. But when he returns, he finds he is more in love than ever.
Werther recites a favorite poem for Charlotte, and at last realizes that fatal
truth: Charlotte can never return his love.

Tomorrow through the vale, the traveler will pass,  
Recalling all of the glory of the past.  
And in vain he will search for the bloom of my youth,  
And nothing will he find but deep pain and endless sorrow.

We keep reaching the end of the line and giving up on each other  
And, darling, I don't think we can survive one more goodbye  
Can't cry one more tear or lie one more lie  
We got one last chance to make it  
But that's all we need if we just take it  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause I know what we got is worth fighting for  
And I know for sure, right or wrong, this is where we belong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, stand together  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love  
  
Baby, after everything we put each other through  
And no matter what damage we do, we still need one another  
And sometimes when I hold you in my arms, somehow I see  
As bad as we've been that's how good we can be  
But we can't just say we want it  
Gotta lay all our tomorrows on it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For all the dues we've paid  
The magic we two have made  
For all we've meant to one another  
Once and for all we've gotta stand up for each other  
  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause we know what we got is worth fighting for  
And we know for sure, right or wrong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, now or never  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love

To touch your hair and walk with me

Then we strolled that golden sand  
Two sweethearts and the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites  
Those days and nights they went flyin' by  
The world was new  
Beneath a blue umbrella sky  
Then softer than a piper man  
One day it called to you  
I lost you  
I lost you to the summer wind  
  
The autumn wind and the winter winds  
They have come and gone  
And still the days  
Those lonely days they go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end  
My fickle friend, the summer wind

Si puo morir, si puo morir d'amor.  
  
Synopses  
Nemorino is in love with a wealthy girl, but she says she isn't interested in
poor boys like him. Desperate, he buys a ""Love potion"" that only turns out to
be cheap red wine. And yet, Nemorino believes the ""Elixir"" will work. When he
sees her cry, he knows she has fallen for him at last.  
  
English translation  
One tear that falls so furtively  
From her sweet eyes has just sprung,  
As if she envied all the youths  
Who laughingly passed her right by.  
What could I want more than this?  
She loves me! I see it.  
One moment just to hear her heart,  
Beating so close next to mine,  
To hear my sighs like they were hers,  
Her sighings as if they were mine!  
Heavens, please take me now:  
All that I wanted is mine now!

Always thinking what she meant to me

Can't be afraid, startin' over  
When you're drownin' in your loneliness  
The hurtin' never ends  
And the night rolls on  
I search for some peace of mind  
No, I can't be wrong  
Won't get burned by desire this time  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back  
I promised myself, till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Wanna get close with somebody  
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast  
It's hard to know when to walk away  
Or try to make it last  
Still the night rolls on  
Secrets are safe in the dark  
And I stayed too long  
I'm not gonna lie to my heart  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back  
I promised myself, till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Someone I can run to  
Just know that it's right  
Trust my heart and soul to  
For the rest of my life  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back

When the love inside my heart was all you needed  
Remember when, you made me wish the night would never end  
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other  
  
If ever two hearts were one, then it was your and mine  
But that was another place in time  
Now all we have to show  
Are memories of a dream we used to know

When did we lose our way, we had it all  
Don't know how it all just slipped away

I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Through all of my life

All I ever will recall of my life  
Is all of my life with you

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known  
  
A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost it's charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there  
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.

We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

You won't be leaving with me  
  
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place  
And have a drink or two  
And then I go and spoil it all,  
by saying something stupid like, I love you  
  
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies  
You heard the night before  
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true  
And never seemed so right before  
  
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say  
To make the meaning come through  
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late  
And I'm alone with you  
  
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red  
And oh the night's so blue  
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid  
Like, I love you

From across the sea  
It lingered there touched your hair  
And walked with me  
  
All summer long  
We sang a song  
And then we strolled on golden sand  
Two sweethearts  
And the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites, those days and nights  
Went flying by  
The world was new  
Beneath the bright blue  
Umbrella sky  
  
Then softer than  
A piper man  
One day, it called to you  
I lost you to  
The summer wind  
  
The autumn wind  
And the winter wind  
They have come and gone  
But still those days  
Those lonely days  
Go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end?  
My fickle friend,  
The summer wind  
  
Umm... That summer wind.  
Warm warm summer wind  
Umm... That summer wind.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!

Michael Jackson,A Place With No Name,/m/michael+jackson/a+place+with+no+name_20894011.html,"As I drove across on the highway  
My jeep began to rock  
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out  
And looked down and noticed I got a flat  
  
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways  
So I can find what I can fix  
I looked around there were no cars on the highway  
I felt a strange feeling like a mist  
  
I walked down towards the end of the road  
And in the fog a woman appeared  
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care  
Take my hand, I'll take you there  
  
Woah-oh  
Take me to a place without no name  
Place without no name  
Take me to a place without no name  
No Name  
  
As she took me right through the fog  
I see a beautiful city appear  
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and  
No one's in fear  
  
She said this is the place where no people have pain  
And in love and happiness  
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'  
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend  
  
Woah-oh  
Take me to a place without no name  
Place without no name  
Take me to a place without no name  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
  
Yeah Yeah  
  
She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me  
She didn't really, really want me to leave  
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done  
This place really looks like a lotta fun  
  
I seen the grass and the sky and the birds  
And the flowers surrounded by the trees  
This place is filled with love and happiness  
And not a world could I wanna leave  
  
So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out  
With my pictures of my family and girl  
This is the place that you choose to be with me  
When you thought you could be in another world

Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go  
  
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love  
People talk, people say what we have is just a game  
Oh, I'll never let you go, come here girl  
Just got to make sweet love 'til the break of dawn

I don't want the sun to shine I want to make love  
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart  
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you  
I won't stop 'til break of dawn makin' love  
  
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you've got me nervous yet  
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise  
There's imagination workin', never been there before  
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never know  
  
Break of dawn, there's no sun up in the sky  
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes  
Break of dawn, girl you got to understand  
It's the way that I love you, let me show you I'm your man  
Break of dawn

Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out  
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play  
Let us walk down the park, makin' love 'til it's dark  
Can you move, can you soothe, 'til the break of dawn and you know it's true,

As she stalked the room  
I could feel the aura  
Of her presence  
Every head turned  
Feeling passion and lust

Took me by surprise  
I can't help but see you  
Running often through my mind  
Helpless like a baby  
Sensual disguise  
I can't help but love you  
It is getting better all the time  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it even if I could  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it, no  
  
Love to run my fingers  
Softly while you sigh  
Love came and possessed you  
Bringing sparkles to your eyes  
  
Like a trip to heaven  
Heaven is the prize  
And I'm so glad I found you  
You're an angel in disguise

Michael Jackson,I Have This Dream,/m/michael+jackson/i+have+this+dream_20486420.html,"Verse 1  
  
Some people say  
I live in a fantasy  
Because I see the world  
Differently  
Visions come to me  
In my sleep  
I closed my eyes  
To see what God is showing me  
  
Close your eyes  
And imagine with me  
See the wonder  
In every living thing  
If we can live our lives  
The way it is in my dreams  
Love will take us to a place where  
God can be seen  
  
This is my dream  
  
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world a place for all humanity  
If we could take love to it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream  
  
Verse 2  
  
Let's put Gods love opn display  
Angel of love come my way  
It really up to you and me  
One world together in harmony  
  
In my dream I see heaven  
And the face of the one perfect being  
I see people turning into angels  
And God giving them their wings  
  
This is my dream  
  
Chorus  
  
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world's a place  
For all humanity  
  
If we could take love  
To it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream

And everyday I thank the Lord  
For a feeling that's so new  
So inviting so exciting  
  
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony  
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms  
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine  
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because  
I'm lost in a world made for you and me  
  
Baby, baby  
I hear a symphony, baby  
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony  
Played sweet and tenderly  
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby  
  
Baby, baby  
I feel the joy begin  
Don't let this feeling end  
Let it go on and on and on now, baby  
  
Baby, baby  
Those tears that filled my eyes  
I cried not for myself  
But for those who have never felt the joy of love  
  
Baby, baby  
Whenever your near  
I hear a symphony  
Each time you speak of me  
I hear a tender note so sweet of love  
  
Baby, baby  
As you stand there holding me  
Whispering how much you care  
A thousand violins fill the air, now  
  
Baby, baby  
Don't let this moment end  
Keep standing close to me  
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

It's here inside  
A lonely heart

Never been my sight always in my heart  
The love is always there it will never die  
Only growing stronger tears down my eye  
I am thinking all the time  
When the day will come  
Standing there before you  
Accept this Hajj of mine  
Standing in ihram, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall  
I feel alive and I feel strong  
  
I can feel Islam running in my Veins  
To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same  
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name  
I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim.  
That they remember you in everything they say  
Standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan

But chasin' boys was just a fad  
You crossed your heart, you'd quit  
When we grew up you traded  
Your promise for my ring

You're doing the same old thing  
  
Stop, the love you save maybe your own  
Darlin' take it slow  
Or some day you'll be all alone

We must bring salvation back  
Where there is love  
I'll be there

I'll have faith in all you do  
Just call my name and I'll be there

Michael Jackson,Jam,/m/michael+jackson/jam_20092665.html,"Nation to nation, all the world must come together,  
Face the problems that we see,  
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.  
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.  
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?  
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.  
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?  
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,  
But we must live each day like it's the last.  
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.  
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to  
  
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,  
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.  
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,  
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.  
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.  
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?  
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,  
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.  
Go with it, go with it.

It ain't too much for me to  
  
Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,  
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.  
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,  
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.  
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a

Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,  
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

The songs of the chill that only brings me tears  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little bear(?)  
You'll be waiting there for me

And so you decided to sold me, out (for the money)  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Close your eyes and count to the ten,  
This won't take a long, just a few seconds (left ahead)  
It doesn't hurt so much either, I'll promise it  
(From all my heart, why would I lie to you my friend)  
  
The pain you made, the pressure you gave  
I held it all, inside of me 'til I past  
Now I shall salute you, the assassin of 2012  
Are you clapping your hands together, that's what I assume  
  
Tonight you'll suffer with the endless pain,  
Dying while dreaming of my forgiveness,  
So this time, I feel like I win  
  
You should just left me on my own  
And take those steps back before you told  
That you can be trusted but seems like you don't  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,

Michael Jackson,Price Of Fame,/m/michael+jackson/price+of+fame_21047390.html,"I took my baby on a river boat cruise  
And she was well aware  
I was excited about the way things could have been  
Cause in it I don't care  
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise  
Someone called out my name  
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab  
My joy has turned to pain  
  
Father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain!  
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame  
So don't you ever complain!  
  
I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene  
They know my every do's  
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"" ?  
That always bothers me  
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind  
Someone is following you  
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad  
They know your every move!  
  
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!

It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain!  
  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!  
Father never lies, my father never lies  
My father never lies  
So don't be feelin' this way boy!  
  
I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say  
Is that boy still alive?  
The week in village what a thrill  
Only the strong survive  
  
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?  
I feel their envious looks at me  
Their mistaken jealousy  
Then stand here in my shoes  
And then get a taste of my blues!  
  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' this way!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain!  
  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!

You try to get me to lose the man I really am

Cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know  
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold

To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard  
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew  
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away  
  
Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed  
Please tell my why  
No there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned  
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

I'm trying to avoid  
But can people on TV see me  
Or am I just paranoid  
  
When I'm in the shower  
I'm afraid to wash my hair  
'Cause I might open my eyes  
And find someone standing there  
  
People say I'm crazy  
Just a little touched

Of Psycho too much

I knew I would see  
A stranger who'd be my friend  
  
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Like it was written in the stars, I knew  
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you  
  
""Thank you.""  
  
Promise me  
We'll always be  
Walking the world together  
  
Hand in hand  
Where dreams never end  
My star secret friend and me  
  
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Look for the rainbow in the sky  
  
Oh, I believe you and I  
Could never really say goodbye

Breathing in the lifeline  
Angels in waiting  
Gone before they could be given wings to fly

And yet they're jaded by

And never got their moment  
But sacrificed a life of comfort  
So that others knew no pain

Inhumanity to man.

Running through my heart.  
Through the long night I will follow  
The glimmer in the dark.

I cannot explain  
How people born of love  
Lose their way to hate.  
Oh, there's gotta be a better way.

Simple words of simple faith

A helping hand  
A soothing chat

Tell me why do I always do  
What I don't want to do  
Now, I'm the only reaper of the seeds that I sow  
And when I walk the field of my stubborn will  
It's a hard row to hoe  
There's a price for getting smarter  
So I pay what I owe  
While bridges burn  
Let the shadow fall behind me  
I am wiser I know  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
Is it out of the fire, back in to the pan  
Is once enough to let it all sink in-or will I do it again  
A time for understanding has now come of age  
So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage  
Try to see the meaning  
Read between every line  
When pages turn  
There'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
  
An engaging temptation had me doing time  
Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire  
We are partners in crime  
But hindsight is clearer  
I can where I've gone and never return  
It's a new man in the mirror  
It's a new freedom song to live and learn  
Always living and learning

Silent little lambs amidst the pain

We use a language no one can explain

We are not the worthy bearers of his name

There's something beautiful and bold  
The power of a million human souls  
Come together as one  
And each in turn goes out to lead  
Another by his word, his love, his deed  
Now the circle is done  
  
It all comes back to One  
For it is He and He alone  
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known

Good King Wenceslaus  
  
Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen.  
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.  
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,  
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.  
  
Hither page and stand by me if thou knowst it telling  
Yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling?  
Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,  
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain.  
  
Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pinelogs hither  
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither  
Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together  
Through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather.  
  
Sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger  
Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer.  
Mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly.  
  
In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted  
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed  
Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing,  
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.  
  
  
Hark the Herald Angels Sing  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echo back their joyus strains  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn king  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)

This undeniable doubt  
A common occurrence  
Feeling so out of place  
  
Guarded and cynical now  
Can't help but wondering how  
My heart evolved into a  
Rock beating inside of me  
So I reel, such a stoic ordeal  
Where's that feeling that I don't feel?

There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
I've been searching for that missing person  
  
Under a lavender moon  
So many thoughts consume me  
Who dimmed that glowing light  
That once burned so bright in me  
Is this a radical phase  
A problematical age  
That keeps me running  
From all that I used to be  
  
Is there a way to return  
Is there a way to unlearn  
That carnal knowledge  
That's chipping away at my soul  
I've been gone too long  
Will I ever find my way home?

Though silent I can tell  
That you're alive and well  
Cause I can feel you move  
In me  
What they try to tell me  
Is that your love is falseWhat they try to tell me  
Is that Your is false  
And faith is just a way  
I choose to feel  
And that there was no meaning  
To You upon the cross  
And I should reach for something that is real  
And when those words are said  
The questions in me start  
And I don't have any answers  
Until I stop thinking with my head  
And start listening to my heart  
And there I find my assurance

Michael W. Smith,Rocketown,/m/michael+w+smith/rocketown_20093046.html,"A Friday night affair  
Out in the city heat  
Always a party there  
Along the sordid street  
And it was guaranteed  
The place to be was Rocketown  
The drinks were two for one  
Inside the crowded bars  
The girls would make their run  
Out on the boulevard  
It was the idol place  
We lived the ways of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
There came a certain man  
A stranger to the crowd  
We didn't understand  
What he was all about  
He walked a different pace  
So out of place in Rocketown  
  
They made a fool of him  
They teased him when he'd speak  
But when they knocked him down  
He'd turn the other cheek  
He told me I could find  
A life outside of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
[Chorus:]  
What was his mission  
Where was he going  
Why was his heart light  
Always glowing  
All I was missing  
He stood there holding  
What was his secret  
Could I know it  
  
Some didn't like him near  
Some laughed and turned away  
But me, I longed to hear  
All that he had to say  
He had a peace of mind  
I couldn't find in Rocketown  
And when I reached down inside me  
I could feel the emptiness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said it's in the heart  
This change that comes to be  
Now he had done his part  
The choice was up to me  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
  
He walked off silently  
And prayed for me  
And Rocketown...

Michael W. Smith,Wired For Sound,/m/michael+w+smith/wired+for+sound_20093050.html,"[Chorus:]  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world that's wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world that's wired for sound  
Comin' on like a tidal wave  
That washes through the brain--a state of mind  
No dispute when the noise is made  
And so it lets the blind lead the blind  
Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try  
Never searching--just accepting  
Feeds the mind enough to get you by  
  
Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world that's wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world that's wired for sound  
Wisdom from the sacred page  
Is turned and ignored  
In a world that's wired for sound

Music: Michael W. Smith  
  
Made a friend last night, or you thought you did  
Had a drink, had a talk, took a drive  
Shared the night, gave up a part of your soul  
Now she's gone and you're a little less alive.  
Shake it off, never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in.  
  
Chorus:  
Yes, you really need a saviour  
Somehow you've known it all along  
Yes, you really need a saviour  
You know you've heard it for so long  
Yes, You really need a saviour  
Someone to come and lead you on  
You need a saviour  
You need a saviour  
It's time  
  
Told yourself today just for your own sake  
What was lost wouldn't cost anyway  
Life's a one night stand, this time you'll win  
The up and down, life-long game that you play.  
  
Shake it off, never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in.

Lies a heart the Father holds  
And when you see your life

To live the life He's livin' in you

Could never measure to the wealth  
Of what he's paid and given to you

With a toy on Christmas day

All I want for Christmas is you  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
All the lights are shining  
Brightly everywhere  
And the sound of  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
I just want him for my own

I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping  
I'm always sleeping naked in case you wake up and you're creeping  
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my
tongue  
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips  
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking baby  
I want to make your fantasies reality I want to be yours baby  
  
[Hook]  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
[Verse 2]  
There ain't nothing that I'm scared to try  
I can be on top or if you like it I'll just lie here  
Take my picture position my body  
Wherever you like just know that I like it naughty  
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met  
But we can't keep just kissing cause you're getting me so wet  
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving  
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up cause I'm screaming  
What are you doing to me  
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free  
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage  
Here I am, here you are  
I want it so hard  
You finger my heart  
And I know just what I need, what I came here to do  
I've been thinking baby, been mostly about you

Miley Cyrus,BB Talk,/m/miley+cyrus/bb+talk_21102745.html,"[Verse 1]  
Alright, so this is really fucked up, but  
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong
that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence,
but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea
what the fuck I want, I guess  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're giving me a feeling in my head  
Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him  
I really, really, really want it, too  
I told all my friends I'm moving on  
Your baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean, even in front of your mom  
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough  
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead
but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You keep saying again and again  
We're laying in my bed just talking  
And now I, now I can't hold it back  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit  
I don't really want to let go of you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 3]  
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest  
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here  
I mean, I'm fucking what?  
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send
back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That
means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit
which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...  
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter
what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
I don't really want [?] you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

As a thunder starts to crash  
Maybe I should give up
