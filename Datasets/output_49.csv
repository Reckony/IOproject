Pet Shop Boys,That's My Impression,/p/pet+shop+boys/thats+my+impression_20107090.html,"I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly, I realised

The wind was chilly and the sky was dull  
I went for shelter to the temple  
Once inside I couldn't believe my eyes  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
Go to a club, you think I'll be there  
I don't go 'cause I'm not a member  
You said you went to apologize  
It's plain to me that's one more lie

Pet Shop Boys,The Night I Fell In Love,/p/pet+shop+boys/the+night+i+fell+in+love_20274544.html,"I was backstage  
Couldn't believe my luck was in  
I saw him approach  
Wearing a most approachable grin  
When he said hello  
I was surprised he spoke so politely  
I said I'd liked his show  
Well he just smiled  
I guess it happens nightly  
And so  
I fell in love  
  
We went to his room  
He had a video camera  
I was so nervous  
I had to try hard not to stammer  
He said  
'I'm glad you liked the show  
That crowd was dope out there tonight, alright  
You want to see some more?  
Well be my guest  
You can have a private performance'  
I'd fallen in love  
  
I didn't ask why  
Though he seemed like such a regular guy  
He said we could be  
Secret lovers  
Just him and me  
Then he joked  
'Hey, man!  
Your name isn't Stan, is it?  
We should be together!'  
And he was passionate  
I guess I would rate  
Him a nine out of ten  
By then  
I'd fallen in love  
  
When I asked  
Why have I heard so much  
About him being charged  
With homophobia and stuff  
He just shrugged  
  
Next morning we woke  
He couldn't have been a nicer bloke  
Over breakfast made jokes  
About Dre and his homies and folks  
Neither of us asked if or when  
We would see each other again  
But I thought that was cool  
'cause I was already late for school  
By then  
I'd fallen in love

For thinking it's a life on the run  
Many roads will cross through many lives  
But somehow you survive  
Look around  
Picture what's in store  
Is this the final edit  
Or is the subject now a bore?  
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)  
You can't ignore  
That life is worth living  
It's still worth a damn

It's something of a sham

At memorials for other faces  
In the crowd  
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)  
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins  
(It's never easy)

Come closer, tonight I'm lonely

So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
I can remember days of sun  
We knew our lives had just begun  
We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young  
Under the moon, address unknown  
I can remember nights in Rome  
I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone  
  
I'd survive with only memories  
If I could change the way I feel  
But I want more than only memories  
A human touch to make them real  
  
Another day, another dream  
Over the bridge an empty scene  
We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  
I don't know why we moved away  
Lost in the here and now we strayed  
Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed  
  
I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue  
You elsewhere with Culver City blues  
Then and there I knew that I'd lost you

Don't give me all your love and pain  
Don't sell me New York in the rain

Rewind and try again  
  
What remains in time that didn't fade away?

Feel the benefit, mental arithmetic  
I waited by the staffroom  
In time for benediction  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
  
To our voices nobody's listening  
We shiver in the rain by the touchline  
Then a coach ride to the station  
""My lord, the carriage awaiteth!""  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
How long?  
  
I'm listening to the words I thought I'd never hear again  
A litany of saints and other ordinary men  
Kneeling on the parquet  
Whatever has gone wrong?  
The fear and feeling hopelessness  
I don't want to belong  
  
I dreamt I was back in uniform  
And a candidate for examination  
History, someone had blundered  
And a voice rapped ""knuckle under!""  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave

Bold mission statements and tightening of belts  
Demolition of familiar landmarks  
Promises made and deals that were dealt

Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again

Science fiction made fact  
Now all we have to look forward to  
Is a sort of suicide pact  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
I can remember planning for leisure  
Living in peace and freedom from fear  
Science that promised to make us a new world  
Religion and prejudice disappear  
  
I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
To threaten, oh God! Amen

Better than before

Maybe it's a sin

Once it gets inside me  
It won't go

You're much too kind

Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
You have a certain quality, which really is unique  
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak  
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud  
Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out  
  
You hated me too  
But not as much as I hated you  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
Then, when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind  
  
Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners  
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner  
And someone said: ""It's fabulous you're still around today,  
You've both made such a little go a very long way""

I just want to hold you, and forget the day.  
I live and breathe your every touch  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
When you look at me across the crowded room,  
Suddenly I want to be alone with you.  
I hang on every word that leaves your lips,  
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss.  
Enough of you is not enough.  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
For so long, I've been trying to believe,  
That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.  
But it's just not there, love isn't always fair.  
  
Would you want the best for me,  
And I hope I find the kind of love you can't feel for me.  
Could you find it in your heart,  
To end this thing right now before it's gone too far  
Let me go and give me up  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
Do you love me that much?

Very bright.  
  
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?  
It's only love and that is all,  
Why should I feel the way I do?  
It's only love, and that is all  
But it's so hard loving you  
Yes it's so hard loving you

Peter Cetera,Ivy Covered Walls,/p/peter+cetera/ivy+covered+walls_20107371.html,"Maybe you can move into a cabin  
And near a river down a lonely winding road  
Friendly conversation  
Then you read by candlelight  
  
Every word of every story told  
Maybe you can move into the castle  
Surrounded by the ivy covered walls  
Find a bit of paradise  
  
Where no one bothers you  
Only time they come is when you call  
  
Something I never realized about the city  
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
It's been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may seem funny  
You can hide if you want, you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look, everyone I see  
Everywhere it's all the same  
  
Something I never realized about the country  
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay

Felt it falling down.  
  
I could feel my balance shifting.  
Everything was moving around.  
  
These streets so fixed and solid.  
Ah, shimmering haze.  
  
And everything I relied on disappeared.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight from the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
All the strangers look like family.  
All the family look so strange.  
  
The only constant, I am sure of.  
Is this accelerating rate of change.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
I stand here, watch you spinning.

A centripetal force.  
You pull me in.  
  
Pull me in.

With heat from her skin, and fire from her breath

It feels like dying, slow, letting go of life  
  
Medicine man lead me up though town, Indian ground, so far down  
Cut up land, each house, a pool, kids wearing water wings, drink in cool  
Follow dry river bed, watch Scout and Guides make pow-wow signs  
Past Geronimo's disco, Sit 'n' Bull steakhouse, white men dream  
A rattle in the old man's sack, look at mountain top, keep climbing up  
Way above us the desert snow, white wind blow  
  
I hold the line, the line of strength that pulls me through the fear  
San Jacinto, I hold the line  
San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line  
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker  
I hold the line, I hold the line

So I watch you wash your hair  
Underwater, unaware  
And the plane flies through the air  
Did you think you didn't have to choose it  
That I alone could win or lose it  
In all the places we were hiding love

In this house of make believe  
Divided in two, like Adam and Eve  
You put out and I receive

And the house is crumbling but the stairways stand  
  
With no guilt and no shame, no sorrow or blame  
Whatever it is, we are all the same

Nothing wrong at all

Some of it is just really dumb

And the sun was beating  
On the soldiers by the side of the road,  
There was a bright light,  
A shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage  
Was wired to the radio,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder,  
This is the long distance call,  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all,  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It was a dry wind,  
And it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth,  
And the dead sand,  
Falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers  
And the automatic earth,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder,  
This is the long distance call,  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all o-yeah,  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It's a turn-around jump shot  
It's everybody jump start  
It's, every generation throws a hero up the pop charts,  
Medicine is magical and magical is art think of  
The Boy in the Bubble  
And the baby with the baboon heart  
  
And I believe  
These are the days of lasers in the jungle,  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere,  
Staccato signals of constant information,  
A loose affiliation of millionaires  
And billionaires and baby,

Her honey belly pulls the seams  
Curves are still upon the hinge  
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin  
  
Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night  
The sponge is full, well out of sight  
All around the conversations  
Icing on the warm flesh cake  
  
Light creeps through her secret tunnels  
Sucked into the open spaces  
Burning out in sudden flashes  
Draining blood from well-fed faces  
  
Desires form in subtle whispers  
Flex the muscles in denial  
Up and down its pristine cage  
So the music, so the trial  
  
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens  
Dance in circles, they the blessed  
Man and wife, undressed by all  
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed  
  
Even as the soft skins tingle  
They mingle with the homeless mother  
Who loves the day but lives another  
That once was hers  
  
The worried father, long lost lover  
Brushes ashes with his broom  
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover  
Bursting over the bride and groom  
  
And the talk goes on  
  
Memories crash on tireless waves  
The lifeguards whom the winter saves  
  
Silence falls the guillotine  
All the doors are shut  
Nervous hands grip tight the knife  
In the darkness, till the cake is cut  
  
Passed around, in little pieces  
The body and the flesh  
The family and the fishing-net  
And another in the mesh  
  
The body and the flesh

Stands the shadow with the spear

Strong beneath my feet

It feeds on the heat

To the place that is higher  
Drawn into the circle  
That dances round the fire  
We spit into out hands  
And breathe across the palms  
Raising them up high  
Held open to the sun  
  
Self-conscious, uncertain  
I'm showered with the dust  
The spirit enters into me  
And I submit to trust  
  
Smash the radio  
No outside voices here  
Smash the watch  
Cannot tear the day to shreds  
Smash the camera  
Cannot steal away spirits

The rhythm has control  
The rhythm is inside me

They blow across your heart  
  
It's the time of the turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes

Like a stale bread  
And the seeds are folded in the soil  
Oh the sun pours  
Then the rains fall  
While the roots reach out right through the ground  
They reach out through the ground  
  
It's the time of turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and the old world's falling  
Nothing you can do can stop the next emerging  
Time of the turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
If we can stand up  
When all else falls down  
We'll last through the winter  
We'll last through the storms  
We'll last through the north winds  
That bring down the ice and snow  
We'll last through the long nights

Each one drawn to empty spaces  
Outsiders, borderline cases  
It's hard to tell black from white  
When you wake up in the middle of the night  
  
Weighed down by the absence of sound  
Broken now by the cry of a hound  
Looking for movement within the haze  
Light can be deceptive with her rays

What up world? Got my insperation in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good  
Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey  
[Verse 1]  
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist  
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with  
Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness...  
[cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is  
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets  
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat  
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat  
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap  
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction  
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted  
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son  
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums  
Look, oo you see me ma  
They wish they could be me ma  
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia  
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad  
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad  
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed  
'cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th  
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under  
'cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer  
[Chorus]  
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine  
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind  
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P
(what).  
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it
comes out in a line so let it  
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out  
[Verse 2]  
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed  
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back  
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack  
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back  
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?  
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat  
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that  
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps  
So many niggas will rise  
So many them niggas try  
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied  
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry  
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride  
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive  
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive  
Devine intervention this is  
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Jesus will arange it, but Jesus won't change it  
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it  
You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??,  
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language  
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish  
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless  
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous  
'cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless  
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless  
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless  
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess  
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous  
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look  
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop  
Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times  
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine  
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'  
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine  
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment  
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga  
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame  
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name  
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think  
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

[Pharrell] Muhfuckers is history!  
[T. Kweli] C'mon!!  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds  
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying  
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town  
She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down  
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now  
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground  
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick  
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp  
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild  
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style  
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celebate]  
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it  
She looking for love in all of the above  
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug  
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card  
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar  
  
[Chorus - Talib Kweli] (Pharrell)  
Broken glass - everywhere! (It's louder!!)  
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (It's louder!!)  
Try to hold back your tears baby! (It's louder!!)  
Wait a second, what happens here baby? (It's louder!!)  
Broken glass - everywhere! (It's louder!!)  
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah  
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!)  
Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!)  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
Dreams shattered like broken glass  
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast  
You complain for the life you supposed to have  
But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh  
Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin  
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying  
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush  
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush  
Time's up, she's about to turn 33  
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery  
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van  
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N. E. Are. D. Fan  
Bigger house, 10, 000 dollar purse fam  
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man  
She the ring leader in a clique of birds  
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
She was a small city girl with big city dreams  
Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans  
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team  
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes  
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love  
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug  
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing  
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion  
Not catching the bus, but back at the station  
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient  
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'  
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high  
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame  
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name  
She need a ticket home if it's the right course  
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse  
  
[Chorus:]

You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'  
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado  
Shit pop ya bottles toast to screen cheers!  
Getcha 2-step cuz it's the record of the year  
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,  
Officially announcing that this is warfare  
Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey  
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away  
But then i sold my first verse that cut the NSX  
But i was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,

They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious  
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,  
She knows the time she sees the richard mille,  
Flat double skeletal tourbillon  
Its just like her body move it turns her on,  
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,  
And all our car doors go up like Transformers  
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway  
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway  
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,

I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,  
Bright as a bitch  
So analyze with caution  
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit  
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track  
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at  
No skateboy P too grown  
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone  
It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!)  
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!)  
I don't smoke but i bet the... love it!  
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,  
  
You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,  
But all these little nigaas got something in reach

Was there a glitch in my method  
Isn't it clear we're here again

We'll bring our children from home

So whose to know, possible (that you could)  
  
Chorus  
  
(Pharrell Verse 3)  
Up, up and away  
I be the wind that blows yourself  
The pixie dust of tinkerbell  
Up, up and away  
I be the wind beneath your wings  
Living color comes with you  
  
(Pusha T Verse)  
Baby let's it pour it up  
Let them galardo doors up  
Pat eve for them louis as soon as the tours up  
The million dollar frame is his and her the same  
I took it on the chin when i heard about the lane  
I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Naw)  
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed  
When considering love you take the Good with the bad  
I've been disappointed by every bitch i ever had  
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad  
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags  
Reverse it I want perfect  
That was half the reason i bought half them purses  
That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface, she ain't have
to rehearse ,My baby's real (Yep)  
That's why i put the chill on her  
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet

Simply run away  
  
[Pharrell:]  
U can try to run and hide  
It wont make a difference  
U can lie to urself  
Of the reason  
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention  
That ur in love with the girl  
  
Yessir, that's her  
But it wasn't like that back wen I met her  
The lavish life from all the do? spun  
Before the RR had the hitchhike thumb  
Her friends didn't like niggaz like us but i  
Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed  
Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up  
But there's more to it  
I remember once  
Sayin' let's shit on the peons  
Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion  
Make em say 'wat we on??  
U say no like u was doin it for eons  
Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons  
Wen it rains it pours  
I laughs to myself wen I change the score  
U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more  
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy  
I guess he played games  
There's only diamond dice here  
Not tryin ta justify  
But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky  
U in trouble ma  
And u should pray about speed  
But if this bout u  
Wat that say about me?

It's really weird cuz a nigga got love

She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug  
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was  
I'm hollin lil mama like wat  
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back  
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser  
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza  
Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza  
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza?  
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas  
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!?

Man I give 'em the dick, you know them bitches just gone  
Nigga raise ya funds, been crazier son  
But nigga ignorant, and Star Trak, take his fun  
I'm the keyboard killer, with the raz-or toungue  
Don't come back tellin me, what play-ers done  
I did it big, and I made it fun  
I made a ton, oh yeah the Rolls Royce got sacadelic flowers  
Painted on it, and I'm leaning on a nigga wit a lazor gun  
The house in Virginia, that's what I'm living in

The word is on the street  
Get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody  
Do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop

Phineas And Ferb,Danny's Story,/p/phineas+and+ferb/dannys+story_20750303.html,"When I was a boy down in South Illinois  
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise.  
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name.  
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same.  
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news.  
If you want a happy life you've got to learn to sing the blues.  
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead.  
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head.  
Daddy said when he was my age boogy-woogy was the thing.  
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing.  
Music has the power that without it he'd have sworn that he'd have never had
met my mom and I wouldn't have been born.  
So what's this?  
This is psychedelia  
It's where the guitar solo came from  
No I mean what with all the colors  
I have no idea  
  
I kept learning all the powers my guitar had  
I made it go walka-walka till it was so good it was bad.  
Just make a face and stop that face you can make that rhythm pump.  
So this is the blues just in a way that makes you want to shake your rump.  
I can make you clap your hands. I can make you do a dance.  
If you want to shake your booty my friend you've got to give the funk a
chance.  
  
Metal!  
Pound your fist in the air!  
Metal!  
Wave your head full of hair!  
It's crunchy and it's nasty full of bad attitude.  
Your parents will think you're crazy!  
Your neighbors will think you're rude!  
Believe it or not it's all the blues again!  
You just add a little fuss and turn your amp up to ten!  
Music has the power to change your life forever!

Monogram: Well, I'm just describing him so that people have a mental  
Picture. It matches the original song.  
  
The night before Christmas  
Was a crisis at the Pole  
Cause old Doofenshmirtz  
He had done his worst  
And a sleigh that day, he stole  
  
Doof too it on a joyride  
Just as far as he was able  
But Doof, that goof, lost control  
Ran into the reindeer stable  
  
Now all the reindeer  
Were on crutches or in traction

Carl: It's a bit archaic.  
Monogram: It's traditional Carl, get o'er it.  
  
So the reindeer were out of commission  
And Santa's sleigh was trashed  
I'd explain it more  
But we've been there before  
It doesn't need to be rehashed  
  
Santa Claus was freaking out  
Thought he'd have to scrap his run  
He was torn inside  
For without a ride  
He knew Christmas Day was done  
  
But then o'er the horizon  
Came a light bright as a star  
Cutting through the night  
Was the two headlights  
Of Perry's hovercar  
  
Perry the platypus  
Had a mission at the Pole  
If he could lend a hand in the frozen land  
He'd help Santa reach his goal  
  
There must have been some magic in that platypus-themed hovercar  
For when Santa saw the gas gauge  
He knew it could take him far  
  
Carl: Really sir?  
Monogram: They want this album yesterday, alright?  
  
Perry the platypus  
Took Santa on his way  
And he came through

And saved our Christmas Day

Phineas And Ferb,How To Be A Lady,/p/phineas+and+ferb/how+to+be+a+lady_20995821.html,"(Spoken) It's frightfully difficult to be a lady.  
There's so many P's and Q's you have to mind.  
(Sung) But the rewards, I'm sure you'll find, are rich and varied,  
And worth all of the effort, you will find.  
Your posture must be perfect,  
Your diction crisp and clear  
Your speaking voice mellifluous and pleasing to the ear,  
Your legs are crossed when seated  
Your toes are pointed so  
Your pinkies raise while drinking  
But that's not all you need to know...  
  
(Tune changes to a heavier punk sound)  
  
You mustn't curse or spit or tattle, never gossip  
A lady never scratches, sweats, or burps  
She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when  
And if soup is served it's impolite to slurp  
  
It's always ""please and thank you, sir or madam""  
Never brash or loud or putting on a show  
A lady is demure, reserved and proper  
And that is really all you need to know

Outside the gate

But they'll just have to wait  
  
Where is the joker?  
Have you seen him around  
With his three coned cap  
That he wears like a clown?  
  
Have you seen his stripped stockings  
And heard his sad tale  
About the kids under the carpet  
And the purple humpbacked whales  
  
Here come the ambassadors  
They show up one by one  
Brett is tasting all the soup  
To see if it is done

Waiting to be let in  
And we're all in the bathtub now  
Making bathtub gin

They've climbed up through the gate  
They didn't mean to be impolite  
But they just couldn't wait

With his silly grin  
He carries a martini  
Made of bathtub gin

Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile

Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants  
Of ritual drumming although at first glance  
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance

His tired feet were buried in the quagmire  
And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him  
And fulfillment of his vow  
  
And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root  
And pulled his body upwards  
To a sea green mossy boulder

And the rocks began to crumble overhead  
And tumble down the mountain to the  
Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs  
through which his path had led  
And the earth began to quake beneath his feet  
And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes

And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack  
I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird  
To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack  
And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow  
And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed  
But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure  
Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice  
And greed

as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him. With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with
glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out
to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

Phish,Esther,/p/phish/esther_20108372.html,"It was late one fall night at a fairground near town  
When Esther first saw the Armenian man  
Who groveled toward her and stood by her side  
With a bucket that swung in his hand  
  
His grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks  
And his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb  
And the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle  
That flashed in his hollow eyed stare  
  
He said ""Little girl, you can chop off my legs  
And then peel off my socks if you want to.  
But I'd rather you took this old puppet from me  
That I hold in my pail as we speak.""  
  
And he stood looking down at the innocent girl  
And she stared at the bucket bewildered  
Til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see  
And a giant smile grew on his face  
She saw the doll's eyes and she couldn't resist  
And she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church  
And she burst through the door with puppet held high  
And a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean  
  
Esther tried in vain to pacify the mob  
Quibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl  
The frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch  
The pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esther's leather sack  
Through the window of the church a storm began to rage  
And Esther knew the time had come to flee  
  
She scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance  
And out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free  
But the wind was blowing harder  
And her skirt began to billow  
Until finally her feet began to lift  
  
And she rose above the people and the houses  
and the chimneys  
And Esther and the doll were set adrift  
Floating higher over the hills, and the valleys and treetops  
they'd flutter and glide  
Soaring and turning suspended on air  
With the earth far below them they'd tumble  
And dive through the clouds  
  
And she began to plummet earthward till she  
Landed in the nasty part of town  
  
She glanced about the village sure to find the evil men  
Who rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night  
Nervously she fumbled for the pouch that held the  
Puppet on her rump.  
  
Feeling quite outnumbered Esther hid behind  
A nearby pile of lumber, where she waited  
Till the dawn  
Cause it would have been a blunder to  
Succumb to a hoodlum on the prowl  
  
When the morning came, she wandered through the streets  
Along the chilly lake that lay beside the town  
At last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound  
It was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down  
  
As Esther stood and shook her head  
The joggers were approaching  
And she knew she had no choice left but to swim  
As the frosty water sank its bitter teeth into her hide  
She tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin  
  
Naked now she made her way toward the shore  
When suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe.  
And the puppet she'd forgotten wrapped its tiny  
Little arms around her ankle and wouldn't let her go.  
  
The waves seemed to open and swallow her whole  
As the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep  
And the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears  
As she drifted away to a tranquil  
And motionless sleep.

as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him.  
  
With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue
and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to
find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

Phish,Lizards,/p/phish/lizards_20108469.html,"Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight  
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor  
He was on his way to see the king  
Wilson  
Wilson  
Wilson  
He led me through the streets of Prussia talking  
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his bootheel  
He said there was a place where we should go  
So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which  
We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring  
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there  
Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing  
  
Chorus:  
  
He said I come from the land of darkness  
I said I come from the land of doom  
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge  
From the land of the big baboon  
But I'm never never going back there  
And I couldn't if I tried  
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
  
He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct  
From doing things smart people don't do  
He said that he was once a Lizard too  
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save  
His people from the fate that lay before them.  
Their clumsy end was perilously near  
The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened  
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book  
In all of Prussia only one existed  
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets  
Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor  
The trick was to surrender to the flow  
We walked along beneath the moon  
He lead us through the bush 'till soon  
We saw before our eyes a raging river  
He said that we could swim it if we tried  
And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms  
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk  
And as his body disappeared before me  
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
But Rutherford and Forbin weren't alone. And suddenly an unexpected movement
caught his eye. On the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing
in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze. A gigantic
mass of muscles and claws. The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in
the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay. And in a flash, the
beast was gone, underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while
Forbin, bewildered, waited alone. The seconds dragged by in what seemed like
hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream. Defeated, he
bowed his head then turned to go. Suddenly with a roar, the creature emerged
before him and held the brave knight's body to the sky. And the creature laid
the knight upon the shore. And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer
that he'd survive. And Rutherford, brave Rutherford was alive.  
  
Forbin and the unit monster were crouched over the soggy knight carefully
removing his bulky helmet when the colonel heard a sound behind him. He turned
around and came face to face with an enormous shaggy horse-like creature
covered from head to tail with alternating blotches of brown and white. It was
a two-toned multi-beast, and atop the multi-beast sat the most beautiful woman
the colonel had ever seen. After fifty-two years of undaunted bachelorhood,
the colonel felt a feeling rush over him as he had never felt before.

Well once upon a time in 1776,  
Thomas Jefferson signed his name on a piece of marijuana,  
And this document was a symbol of freedom and of liberty,  
At least for the rich, white gentry.  
  
As time marched along,  
This plant that I refer to has been used for everything,  
From medicine to the American flag.  
And now it seems to me  
That somewhere along the way,

Ha to kill the compitition.  
Government hysteria, monopoly and conflict of interest,  
With total impunity.  
  
Yeah, so, if you don't buy the conspiracy,  
Just look at the reality  
That your tax dollars go  
To spray poison on the fields of a farmer in South America.  
And as an added bonus,  
Your neighbor might be the proud recipions of that poison weed.

Hired to promote the status quo,  
But what is the shelf life of bad legislation.  
The hypocrite smirks, it's a moral disgrace  
As he reads from a law that was written  
About the same time that he had  
His last original thought.  
  
Well the men said he was dying,  
And the nausea and the pain left him wasting away  
And unable to keep a meal down.  
So he tried everything a prescription could obtain  
But to no avail.  
The side effects were worse than the pain.  
So now he breaks the law  
To use the one thing that seems to help him out.  
And the people say, Oh he's just getting' high.  
But not to change the subject but,  
Didn't you ever wonder why getting' high's a crime,  
Yeah a crime.

Phish,Old Home Place,/p/phish/old+home+place_20108472.html,"It's been ten long years since I left my home in the hollow where I was born  
Where the cool fall nights make the woods smell right and the fox hunter blows
him horn  
I fell in love with a girl from the town, I thought that she would be true  
I ran away to Charlottsville and worked in a sawmill or two  
What have they done to the old home place?  
Why did they tear it down?  
And why did I leave the plow in the field and look for a job in the town?  
Now the girl ran off with somebody else, tariffs took all my pay  
And here I stand where the old home stood before they took it away  
Now geese fly south and the cold wind blows as I stand here and hang my head  
I lost my love and lost my home, and now I wish that I was dead

The stars though she seemed to respect  
  
The faint light that flutters at night to the  
earth  
Would land in her eyes and collect  
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf  
I never thought to inspect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind  
Seem to get lost and harder to find  
When I am alone I am inclined  
If I find a pebble in sand  
To think that it fell from my hand  
  
She gave me ideas  
Planted the seed  
But she never stopped to reflect  
The course that she's on, wherever it leads  
I never would redirect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend  
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end  
When we're alone we all seem to tend  
If we find a marble in dust  
To wish someone left it for us

Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more  
Till I hit the ground on Prussia's shores  
How was I to know that day  
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way  
But soon towards me from the East  
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beast  
Hey!  
Well, it seemed he didn't like my face  
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place  
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip  
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip  
Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack  
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back  
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed  
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed  
Singing, ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye""  
Hey!  
Now Wilson knew that I was loose  
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse  
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree  
So angrily I paddled to the open sea  
But the sea was eager to beat me back  
And the waves grew huge and deadly black  
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head  
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead  
When the morning came and the storm had passed  
The dismal fog began at last  
To open up before my eyes  
And there I saw to my surprise  
Chains and specks of islands curved  
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved  
Parked my kayak on a stone  
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne  
I said, ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye  
Wilson, kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye""

On the day the wall came down  
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground  
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight  
  
I dreamed you had left my side  
No warmth not even pride remained  
And even though you needed me  
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you  
  
Now life devalues day by day  
As friends and neighbours turn away  
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone  
  
Now frontiers shift like desert sands  
While nations wash their bloodied hands  
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray  
  
I woke to the sound of drums  
The music played, the morning sun streamed in  
I turned and I looked at you  
And all but the bitted residue slipped away slipped away

I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all  
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud  
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year  
And I would like to know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Not a single word was said, delights still without fears  
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need  
I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of '95  
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there  
Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you  
Have you time before you leave to greet another man  
Just you let me know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Good-bye to you  
Charlotte Kringles too  
I've had enough for one day

Heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.

The chief blew smoke rings two by two!

Swan lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,  
Loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.  
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,  
Pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,  
His eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.  
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested  
Tropic, swan lee had a bow by his side  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee kept time, half on land, half on water,  
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.  
He followed his ears to the great water fall,  
Swan lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!  
  
The land in silence stands....  
  
Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,  
Confronted swan lee as his song he sang,  
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards  
It was all written down by long silas lang.  
  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands.

Good-bye Ma.

And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air  
You hear the tolling bell  
And touch the silk in your lapel  
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band  
You take her frail hand  
And hold on to the dream.  
A place to stay

Where you can speak out loud  
About your doubts and fears  
And what's more no-one ever disappears  
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.  
You can relax on both sides of the tracks  
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control  
And everyone has recourse to the law  
And no-one kills the children anymore.  
And no one kills the children anymore.

I'm like a quarterback, I got options  
But I played the point in school  
Broke ankles, more than a few  
Broke hearts, yeah, that too  
20 Years later, same movie, same script,  
Same player, more chips, more women, more haters  
Different toilet, same shh  
Why get caught up in the motions?  
Why go through the same emotions?  
In a sick way she love to see me mad  
It gets her wetter than the ocean  
She's a good girl gone bad  
But bad girls don't like good guys  
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy  
That's what I thought huh let's ride  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did,  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
They act hard but they got soft hearts  
And I know they're soft spots  
I meet them, I greet them, I train them  
And show them all about hard knocks  
Listen, next thing you know next thing you know)  
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox (Fort Knox)  
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not  
Damn, these are called rules of engagement  
Welcome to the world of entertainment  
They don't want a man like Reeman  
They want a man that's stuck in the remains  
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys  
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?  
That's what I thought, now let's ride  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say

These words are written in blood, on red and white lines  
Rhymes to the beat of a war drum that cries  
Like mothers whose sons were sent to fight  
And widows whose spouses souls are all that keep them warm at night  
Underneath spacious skies where stars look more like bulletholes  
And the haze of the clouds more like shrouds  
I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep  
Cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives  
Bush is duckin the truth while the few and the proud dodge landmines  
Niggaz is doin time for gettin caught with a dime  
But he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation  
Impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line  
And STOP, falling for the lies  
The war ain't only in Iraq  
It's time we fight back, for control of our minds

I'm in the cut in the club  
Scopin the scene  
Cup half way full  
Smokin the green  
She got her hand on my nuts  
What does that mean?  
Pointed at her friend  
And she said, they'll tag team  
Now who said dreams don't come true  
Its like I'm dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck?  
That's why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Ya'll have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)

Pit's got tight raps  
When I'm in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
""Does he got cash?""  
Lil Jon's at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
No doubt  
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef, you don't want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city I'm from  
Is covered with federals

I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
that's testin my patience like doctors  
I'm not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All that's bullshit  
If that's what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
I'll let you know

So you tried, to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand.  
  
I sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers,  
Try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus,  
God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons  
I'm fighting myself, believe me,  
I'm far from ignorant, Far from greedy  
If you know where I come from, know what I've been through  
You think there should have been another outcome  
Just like most kids, a father I did it without one  
Come from the city, X you like Malcolm, then you wonder how come  
I can move in the room full of wolves so swift so smooth,  
Thank you mom for making me a man  
Let that mother fucker knock me and my castle to the sand

So you tried to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand.  
  
Look  
I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple  
Came down the south beach to build a new castle  
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle,  
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to,  
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner,  
I'm coming out with dinner wearing the chinchilla,  
I did it for my town to show em the big picture,  
Kid Hit the switch, I promise to never switch up,  
This is for my brother two three who went to jail,  
I'm send all the picture of my shows through the mail  
He hit me with a letter, said: I knew you'd never fail,  
So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pale

So you try to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land

[Verse One: 2Pac]  
They say more money and women are funny,  
But in this tragic endings I can make a million and still not  
Get enough for spendin'  
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell-bound  
I'd rather be buried than be worried diffrent than be held down  
My game plans to be trained well  
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetary car  
I've been lost since my adolescent callin from Jesus  
Ballin' as a gangsta wonderin' if you see this  
Young black male crack sales got me three strikes  
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die,  
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listenin?  
Got my hands on my semi-shotgun, everybody's snitchin'  
Please God can you understand me, bless my family  
Guide us all before we fall into insanity  
I'm makin' a point for all my people to be warlike  
Buy some shit to have you stupid bitches all tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Go niggas wanna get on that's right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now  
  
Go niggas wanna get on that's right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now  
  
[Pitbull]  
I'm doing the impossible  
I gotta big flow that's unbelievable,  
I'm achieving the unachievable  
I'm taking over like coke and baking soda  
The streets are waiting for me  
But for those who don't know me don't hate on me come on homie  
  
Ya'll should know me better  
Don't be mad cause I'm a go getter from the bottom to ny to la  
Cubans and Essays and old school Chevys  
Blacks and Hispanics getting money I know yall can't stand it  
That's why I say fuck 'em that just gives me more reason to buck 'em  
If you're felling lucky, then dog, press your luck  
And watch how quickly you get stuck I'll make sure when they hold you down  
You wont get up, Dade County bet that up.  
  
For building me the way I've been built to the day I get killed  
I'ma get money and run through bitches like Wilt the Stilt  
Chamberlain empty the chamber in in your face  
And leave your brains outa place  
That's what happens to slow niggas that think they can live life at a fast
pace  
To them boys on the way to Tennesse listening to mj G breaking there burrs
down in Eightballs  
Be careful with them keys  
Don't hesitate to squeez watch out from them feds  
'Cause they hate ya'll  
Bank accounts over seas when them Feds come for me all they gonna find is cds
and tapes, dog  
Sipping hypnotiq and hennessy I know ya'll envy me but l wont let my tallent
go to waste, dog.  
  
[50 Cent]  
Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise  
My success'll be the death of you  
Lo and behold you sold your soul  
Nigga there's nuttin left of you  
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?  
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?  
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched  
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot  
But you're not now!  
I see it so clear  
You can't take the pressure, you pussy  
I warned you not to push me  
You see me and chills run up your spine  
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine  
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace  
I was playin with guns  
While your momma had your punk ass playin tennis

Maybe I'm too blunt, but why front!  
You got it going on, just pull up your skirt

Take it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left.  
I am sick, whiskey-dick, no more battles for me,  
You'll be calling a trick, cause you'll no longer sleep.  
I'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone,  
I'll laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home!

I will do what I please, anything that I want,  
I will breathe, I won't breathe, I won't worry at all.  
You will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear,  
All the lies, all the wise, will be crystal clear.

Dear Mr. President  
Come take a walk with me

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street  
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep  
What do you feel when you look in the mirror  
Are you proud  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
And tell me why  
  
Dear Mr. President  
Were you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
How can you say  
No child is left behind  
We're not dumb and we're not blind  
They're all sitting in your cells  
While you pave the road to hell  
  
What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away  
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay  
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say  
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye

P!nk,Heartbreaker,/p/pnk/heartbreaker_20479959.html,"I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye  
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?  
What about the way you say you love me all the time  
Are you liftin' me up to heaven just to drop me down the line?  
There's a ring around my finger, but will you change your mind?  
And you tell me that I'm beautiful but that could be lie  
Are you a heartbreaker  
Maybe you want me for the ride  
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leavin' here alive  
I wont be leavin' here alive, no  
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife  
Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side  
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now  
Watch it all play out see if you really stick around  
But there's always this one question that keeps me up at night  
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if I'm fallin' for
a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I'm holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh  
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride  
I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker  
This time around I wont survive cause if I've fallin' for a heartbreaker  
And everything is just a lie

Ah, the night is calling?  
And it whispers to me softly come and play  
But I, I am falling  
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe  
Up high  
Nothing can touch me  
But why do I feel this party's over?  
No pain  
Inside  
You're like perfection  
But how do I feel this good sober?  
  
Coming down, coming down, coming down  
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round  
I'm looking for myself, sober  
Coming down, coming down, coming down  
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round  
Looking for myself, sober  
  
When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad  
'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had  
I have heard myself cry, never again  
Broken down in agony just tryin' to find a friend  
  
Oh,  
Oh,

P!nk,Stolen Life,/p/pnk/stolen+life_20613284.html,"Chorus  
Wake up in the morning go to work  
Fire up the truck and drive to Sonoma  
Hop on the forklift  
Fill up the truck with ten thousand pounds of newspaper  
Ten thousand pounds of racist, trash, and lies  
Drive the truck back to Santa Rosa put the newspaper in the recycle  
So the rich white man can print out the same batch of lies  
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again  
  
It's too bad the cops had to kill that man  
But he had a broomstick and he was Asian  
We know they're all samurai warriors  
They're all kung fu masters  
They're all just like Jackie Chan  
It's too bad the cops had to restrain his wife  
Cause she was a registered nurse and she tried to save his life  
But that would go against rules and regulations  
To just forget at 2 at night  
We're so proud of our boys in blue  
Cause they always do what's right  
I saw Eileen today  
I saw her children play in the courtyard  
Lately it occurred to me  
How does a mama tell her children their dad got killed by the police?  
  
Chorus  
  
It's too bad the cops had to kill that kid  
But someone called in a stolen walkman  
The cops they chased him down but he refused to lie face on the ground  
And he just walked away  
The cop said, ""This punk can't walk away in the all black night  
So I had to shoot him in the back of the head  
From fifty feet away  
I had to kill him it was self defense  
I was afraid he would circle back around and kill me. ""  
I saw Corneleus speak today at the Hayward High  
That other police stole his sons life away  
Over a walkman that wasn't that much more than change  
How does a father find justice for a son stolen away?  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away

And, now it's just annoying  
Cause, no one has the answer  
So I guess it's up to me  
To find the truth about love  
As it comes, and it goes

Sheet marks rug burn, and a sugar glaze  
The shock and the awe that can eat you raw

I think it just may be perfect

The truth about love is it's nasty and salty  
It's the regret in the morning, it's the smelling of armpits  
It's wings, and songs  
And trees, and birds  
It's all the poetry that you ever heard  
Terror coup d'etat, life line forget-me-nots  
It's the hunt and the kill  
The schemes and the plots  
The truth about love is it's blood, and it's guts  
Purebreds and mutts  
Sandwiches without the crust  
It takes your breath, cause it leaves a scar  
But those untouched never got never got very far

Oh, you can shoot a gun and  
Convince you're the only one that's ever felt this way before

It folds together pocket thin and  
It's whispered by the angels' lips and  
It can turn you into a son of a bitch man

I sat there nearly lifeless  
An old man in the corner sang  
Where the water lilies grow  
And on the jukebox johnny sang  
About a thing called love  
And it's how are you kid and what's your name  
And how would you bloody know?  
In blood and death neath a screaming sky  
I lay down on the ground  
And the arms and legs of other men  
Were scattered all around  
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed  
Then prayed and bled some more  
And the only thing that I could see  
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me  
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three  
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin I'll go  
For a pair of brown eyes  
  
I looked at him he looked at me  
All I could do was hate him  
While ray and philomena sang  
Of my elusive dream  
I saw the streams, the rolling hills  
Where his brown eyes were waiting  
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes  
That waited once for me  
So drunk to hell I left the place  
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking  
A hungry sound came across the breeze  
So I gave the walls a talking  
And I heard the sounds of long ago  
From the old canal  
And the birds were whistling in the trees  
Where the wind was gently laughing  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin I'll go  
For a pair of brown eyes

For to go to a dance in the town  
I set off at seven to be there for eleven  
No thought of the rain comin' down  
I pushed up the hill, the rain started to spill  
So for shelter I had to resort  
Helter-skelter I went as downhill I sped  
To the trees at the old fairy fort  
I pulled up me bike, be a tree in the gripe  
To find shelter out of the storm  
The rain it came down and like stones beat the ground  
It was grand to be dry in that storm  
I was dreamin' away about better days  
When a voice, it says, ""Dirty old night""  
I fell over me bike, I got such a fright  
When the ghostly voice bid me the night  
But you jumped up with a start, gave the storm not a thought  
As the hail beat a rhythm on me  
And I stared at the tree that had spoken to me  
Not a body was there I could see  
I trembled and shook the tree, twisted and booked  
As the wind got into a scream  
And I grabed for me bike in that devil's owned night  
Expecting to wake from a dream  
The voice I had heard, not another word said  
As the hair on the head stood on me  
And I said an ""Our Father"" as I peddled much faster  
Away from that ghost haunted tree  
For weeks and weeks after with nerves a disaster  
Nowhere near that road would I go  
And from dusk through the night I would shake with the fright  
Of the tree that had haunted me so  
Now, whenever I go to a dance in the town  
I make sure not to stop on the way  
To be there for eleven, I still leave at seven  
But I go be a different way

Who brought home the Fenian prisoners  
From dying in foreign nations

And it's there you'll see the pipers  
And the fiddlers competing  
And the sporting wheel of fortune  
And the four and twenty quarters  
  
And there's others without scruple  
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie  
And her father well contented  
And he gazing at his daughter  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
And it's there you'll see  
The jockeys and  
They mounted on so stably  
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green  
  
The colours of our nation  
The time it came for starting  
All the horses seemed impatient  
Their feet they hardly touched the ground  
The speed was so amazing!  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
There was half a million people there  
Of all dominations  
The Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew  
The Presbyterian

Not matter what persuasion  
But failte hospitality  
Inducing fresh acquaintance

But someone said they closed the country down

Two years out of school

The day we sailed away  
I remember it so well  
Took one look at the North Wall  
And bid a fond farewell  
  
It's a hard thing to leave the land  
Of your childhood  
Touched by the rivers  
And kissed by the sea  
The places you played  
With your childhood companions  
To leave dear old Ireland and

That I'll keep within me  
Deep in my heart a furious devotion  
The love of old Ireland  
And Mother Mo Chroi  
  
At the top of Pentonville Road  
I saw the sun setting  
The town laid out before me  
Looked beautiful to me  
Away from all the sighing  
The suffering and dying  
I dreamed of the future  
The young and the free  
  
But the years they go by quickly  
Now I know I can't remain here  
Where each day brings me closer  
To that final misery  
My kids will never scrape shit round here  
And I won't die crying in a pint of beer

He's busy being born again  
  
I met god on primrose hill  
That's where he came to me  
He stepped out of his saucer  
I got down on my knees  
From his lips came just one word  
He left me all aglow  
I sat down and had a smoke  
And watched the flowers grow  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The secret of the universe  
Is hidden in this song  
  
The shaman left a crawling  
As the dawn broke the gloom  
Talking in some other tongue  
And laughing like a loon  
The early morning sunlight  
Splashed colours on the wall  
And i don't know if it ever  
Really happened at all  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The molecules inside my head  
Are chiming like a gong  
  
The bats are in the belfry  
And the bubbles in the bong  
The secret of the universe  
Is hidden in this song

Pogues,Streams Of Whiskey,/p/pogues/streams+of+whiskey_20109776.html,"Last night as I slept  
I dreamt I met with Behan  
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day  
When questioned on his views  
On the crux of life's philosophies  
He had but these few clear and simple words to say  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
I have cursed, bled and sworn  
Jumped bail and landed up in jail  
Life has often tried to stretch me  
But the rope always was slack  
And now that I've a pile  
I'll go down to the Chelsea  
I'll walk in on my feet  
But I'll leave there on my back  
  
Because I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
Oh the words that he spoke  
Seemed the wisest of philosophies  
There's nothing ever gained  
By a wet thing called a tear  
When the world is too dark  
And I need the light inside of me  
I'll walk into a bar  
And drink fifteen pints of beer  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing  
I am going, I am going  
Where streams of whiskey are flowing  
  
I am going, I am going  
Any which way the wind may be blowing

Pogues,The Band Played Waltzing Matilda,/p/pogues/the+band+played+waltzing+matilda_20158168.html,"When I was a young man I carried my pack  
And I lived the free life of a rover  
From the murrays green basin to the dusty outback  
I waltzed my matilda all over  
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said son  
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be  
Done  
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun  
And they sent me away to the war  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As we sailed away from the quay  
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the  
Cheers  
We sailed off to Gallipoli  
  
How well I remember that terrible day  
When the blood stained the sand and the water  
And how in that hell that they called suvla bay  
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter  
Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well  
He showered us with bullets, he rained us with  
Shells  
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell  
Nearly blew us right back to Australia  
But the band played waltzing Matilda  
As we stopped to bury our slain  
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs  
Then it started all over again  
  
Now those who were living did their best to survive  
In that mad world of blood, death and fire  
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive  
While the corpses around me piled higher  
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit  
And when I woke up in my hospital bed  
And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was  
Dead  
Never knew there were worse things than dying  
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda  
To the green bushes so far and near  
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs  
No more waltzing Matilda for me  
  
So they collected the cripples, the wounded and  
Maimed  
And they shipped us back home to Australia  
The legless, the armless, the blind and insane  
Those proud wounded heroes of suvla  
And as our ship pulled into circular quay  
I looked at the place where me legs used to be  
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me  
To grieve and to mourn and to pity  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As they carried us down the gangway  
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared  
And they turned all their faces away  
  
And now every April I sit on my porch  
And I watch the parade pass before me  
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march  
Reliving the or their dreams of past glory  
i see the old men, all twisted and torn  
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war  
And the young people ask me, ""what are they  
Marching for?""  
And I ask myself the same question  
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda  
And the old men still answer to the call  
But year after year their numbers get fewer  
Some day no one will march there at all  
  
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda  
Who'll go a-Waltzing Matilda with me?

To the shores where his fathers laid

He fought the champ in Pittsburgh  
And he slashed him to the ground  
He took on Tiny Tartanella  
And it only went one round  
He never had no time for reds  
For drink or dice or whores  
But he never threw a fight

So they sent him to the war

When I said goodbye to you  
I remember how I swore  
That I'd come back to you one day  
And as the sunset came to meet  
The evening on the hill  
I told you I'd always love you  
I always did, I always will  
  
Fare thee well, gone away, there's nothing left to say  
Accept to say adieu  
To your eyes as blue  
As the water in the bay

And a fiddle playing sean dun na ngall

With the saints and with the saviors  
With the maggots and the Gods  
I cursed the things they showed me  
I could never see again  
And the howling of the wind at night  
I wrote upon the rain  
I found the thing for which I prayed  
And came back home to the USA  
With a heart of stone, so now I know  
That it's the same wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Come, come here we come  
Come, come here we come  
Come, come here we come

The hour when the ship comes in  
Oh the seas will split and the ship will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking  
Then the tide will sound and the wind will pound  
And the morning will be breaking  
Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls they'll be smiling  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat that drifts on to the shore line  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
The foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
Jerk from their beds and think they're still dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin' we'll meet all your demands  
We'll shout from the bow your days are numbered

Eat  
There's nothin' like a city block of hangin' lights, where I  
Just wanta curl up by the fire for a couple cups of cider and  
Roast all those marshmallows  
  
Add a pinch of cinnamon and suddenly the world begins to taste like  
December  
And you'll always remember comin' down to Candy Cane Lane...  
Just a couple licks from the minty sugar stick and everything turns  
Wintergreen  
On Candy Cane Lane, one block from Gum Drop Street

And all will enter in

If you sing for joy the rest of us will lift our voices too

That we'll gather together no matter how the highway bends  
I will not lose this circle of friends  
Among the nations, tribes and tongues we have sisters and brothers  
And when we meet in heaven we will recognize each other  
With joy so deep and love so sweet  
Oh we'll celebrate these friends  
And a life that never ends

Now is a time to begin  
  
So give to the needy and Pray for the grieving  
Even when you don't think that you can  
Cause all that you do is bound to come back to you  
So think of your fellow man  
And make peace with God and Make peace with yourself  
Oh yeah  
Cause in the end there's nobody else  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did

Point Of Grace,What Child Is This?,/p/point+of+grace/what+child+is+this_20109836.html,"What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  
Haste, haste to bring him laud,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,  
Come peasant king to own Him,  
The King of kings, salvation brings,  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  
  
Raise, raise the song on high,  
The Virgin sings her lullaby:  
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

Point Of Grace,What's He Gonna Say About Me,/p/point+of+grace/whats+he+gonna+say+about+me_20109890.html,"Now and then I must admit  
I hide behind my shallowness  
I must confess I don't begin to say enough  
I'll tell you of my lessons learned  
But I may never quite express  
  
That God blessed me far beyond  
What I deserve  
I often miss the chance to show my  
Faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What's He gonna say about me  
When He weighs the works that  
I have done  
Against the words that I have  
Failed to speak  
What's He gonna say about me  
When the chaff is sifted from the wheat  
Will there be evidence that I believed  
What's He gonna say about me  
  
After this lifetime will come  
The thankfulness that I forget  
I will regret when I see clearly who He is  
Then I'll know all I should have said  
So I must choose to not neglect  
But resurrect the praise for all He is to me  
I often miss the chance to show my faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me, oh

If I confess Him before men  
He will confess me before the  
Father in heaven

Some think it all comes down to  
Fate and circumstance  
Life falls somewhere between  
Accident and chance  
Some seek solutions to the problems  
They face  
By hoping maybe someday, somehow  
It will all fall in place  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing

Without the love of jesus  
The stars wouldn't shine  
Rivers wouldn't run  
And hearts beat out of time  
Without the love of jesus  
Tell me where would we be?  
Lost on a lonely sea  
Without the love of jesus  
There's so much more to life than meets  
The naked eye  
It's no coincidence, no matter how we try  
When we try to deny what we  
Don't understand  
Maybe that's when we fail to see god's  
Providential hand  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing

It shouldn't take us a miracle  
Before we finally see  
That jesus' love is the only thing  
That we will ever need

To forgive me for my sins

Can't you love me just the

Poison,Only Time Will Tell,/p/poison/only+time+will+tell_20109987.html,"I just needed someone to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
and the nights grew cold  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
  
You touched my soul  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
when I couldn't fly  
  
There's no words could explain  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
  
In a world full of anger  
and times gone strange  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
  
But everybody needs a little something  
Tu pull them through  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
  
Chorus:  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road along  
  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
  
You're the one  
That touched my very soul  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go

It's time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside

You pulled me through

I knew she didn't love me  
But I didn't think she'd want me, no  
Right there she took me  
Underneath that sun, we became one

We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange

Asked what I was looking for  
  
Then I looked in her eyes,  
For the first time I realized  
I really didn't know anymore  
  
Sometimes I think I want true love  
Most times I feel like there's no one  
But in the meantime hold me tight  
Things will be alright

Made our plans so secretly  
To run away and fly to be  
With the two birds of paradise

Back in the room the things I remember  
One time when we took off our clothes  
But you were cryin', cryin'  
You said nothing lasts forever  
We were happy together

Maybe not

Fruit cut from the vine  
Forgot and left to rot  
Long before its time  
This is a story  
About the girl who lived next door  
Looking for someone to hold  
  
A wish made on a star  
Brought her here tonight  
At a courtyard she waits  
A thousand broken dates  
But she holds the hymnal  
Where so carefully pressed  
Is the English rose she laid to rest  
  
It's only a story  
Flowers in full bloom  
Bouquets in every room  
Ooh, this is a story  
Fruit cut from the vine  
Looking for someone to hold

I am the Antipop, the man you cannot stop.  
  
As a young man,  
I plug into the tube,  
But the stench of all that pretense  
I cannot muddle through.  
  
I lay on my back  
And scan the radio  
All that comes out my speakers  
Is a steady syrup flow.  
  
I suck information through the holes in my skull  
As my belly gurgles hungry my mouth is always full.  
  
I stood by watching  
And I seen 'em come and go.  
I seen 'em make that million  
Then vanish in the snow.  
  
They come upon you  
Like a pack of rabid hounds  
As they slobber in your ears  
And purge you with their sounds.  
  
Pushing misinformation through the holes in my skull  
My belly gurgles nauseous and still my mouth is full.  
  
I am Antipop, I'll run against the grain till the day I drop.  
I am the Antipop, the man you cannot stop.

Primus,The Ballad Of Buckethead,/p/primus/the+ballad+of+buckethead_20110956.html,"""who's this guitar-playing sonsa bitch? "", is a question common asked.  
On his head a bucket of chicken bones, on his face a plaster mask.  
He's the bastard son of a preacher man, on the town he left a stain.  
They made him live in a chicken house to try to and hide the shame.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.  
  
Farmers would torment him as he snuggled with the hens.  
They'd hose him down with water, and steal his little friends.  
Now late at night he'd sneak off to the graveyard all alone,  
And play a soapbox guitar to the faces made of stone.  
  
Buckethead found his freedom at the age of 17,  
When he burned the chicked house down with a quart of gasoline.  
He did puppet shows on corners and bought a real guitar,  
And with the help of colonel sanders, he's bound to be a star.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.

Primus,To Defy The Laws Of Tradition,/p/primus/to+defy+the+laws+of+tradition_20110904.html,"What if Christmas didn't come this year  
And no one paid for Christmas cheer?  
Who would cry the biggest tear,  
The child or the store?  
Why do brides wear virgin white?  
Most do not deserve that right.  
But to choose a color of their delight  
Would surely bring on the frowns.  
To defy the laws of tradition  
Is a crusade only of the brave.  
Suppose the taxman, he comes to town,  
And you don't lay your money down.  
Yet Mr. Jones he killed Mr. Brown the other day.  
Well I wonder, who's gonna go to hell.

Primus,Tommy The Cat,/p/primus/tommy+the+cat_20110928.html,"Well, I remember as it were a meal ago  
  
Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter  
May have nestled its way into his mighty throat  
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down  
The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine  
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator  
Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell  
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did  
  
She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit  
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the  
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days  
The sight was beyond belief  
Many a head snapped for double--even triple--takes as this vivacious  
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most  
Virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out  
  
They hung in droves  
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place  
And that was O'Malley's Alley  
  
The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended)  
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into  
The heart of the alleyway  
She knew what she wanted  
She was lookin' for that stud bull  
She was looking for that he cat  
And that was me  
  
Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee  
  
Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  
Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?  
Ah, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  
Say, baby?  
Say, baby?

Too many puppies are taught to heal.

Sleek animal pelts.

Too many puppies with guns in their hands.  
Too many puppies in foreign lands.  
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine.  
Too many puppies are just like me.  
Too many puppies are afraid to see.  
The visions of the past brought to life again,  
Too many puppies, too many dead men.
