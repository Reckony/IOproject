And if you don't abide by them you must be a fool  
We have the power to control the whole land  
You never must question our motives or plans -  
cause well outlaw your voices, do anything we want  
we've nothing to fear from the nation  
Well throw you out of your houses if you get too much  
If we have to well destroy your generation  
  
cause we've built up a frontage and we've gained respect  
there's no one to endanger our position -  
  
Standards rule ok  
Standards rule ok  
Standards rule ok

And we don't like people who stand in our way  
Awareness is gonna be redundant  
And ignorance is strength, we have God on our side

The Jam,Start!,/j/jam/start_20068899.html,"It's not important for you to know my name -  
Nor I to know yours

It will be enough  
For knowing that someone in this world  
Feels as desperate as me -  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
It doesn't matter if we never meet again,  
What we have said will always remain.  
If we get through for two minutes only,  
It will be a start!  
For knowing that someone in this life,  
Loves with a passion called hate  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you - again.  
  
And what you give is what you get!

Playing around and conniving  
Undesired tears I was crying

I was just a backseat driver in a car of love  
Going wherever you take me  
Don't know why I put up with the pain  
Cause no one else can make me  
  
You've got me going - stoned out of my mind  
And when you led me to the waters I drank it  
But I drank more than I could hold  
And you took my mind off my body  
And now you want to take my soul  
  
Where can I run?  
Where can I hide?  
Who can I talk to?  
Tell me what more can I do?

Playing around with every guy in town  
It's funny I just can't put you down  
See my head - its spinning around  
Since the day you let me down

Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose  
You can't be nice in a strange town

And we got to go, man  
  
Rush my money to the record shops  
I stop off in a back street  
Buy myself a snort  
We got our own manifesto  
Be kind to queers  
And I'm so glad the revolution's here  
It's nice and warm now!  
  
I've finished with clubs where the music's loud  
Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd

I look in the mirror

Just a thin, clean layer of mister sheen

An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth  
Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat  
Lights going out and a kick in the balls

Days of speed and slow time Mondays  
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday  
Watching the news and not eating your tea  
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls  
  
That's entertainment, that's entertainment  
  
Waking up at six am on a cool warm morning  
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol  
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard  
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays  
  
That's entertainment, that's entertainment  
  
Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes  
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume  
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac  
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away  
  
That's entertainment, that's entertainment  
  
Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight  
Two lovers missing the tranquillity of solitude  
Getting a cab and travelling on buses  
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs

The promise of your kiss

I want to close my eyes and be like the rest

Loaded the guns then you run off home for your tea,  
Left me standing, like a guilty (naughty) schoolboy.  
  
We came out of it naturally the worst,  
Beaten and bloody and I was sick down my shirt,

Maybe a hard one to face up to

The Jam,Wasteland,/j/jam/wasteland_20068890.html,"Meet me on the wastelands - later this day  
We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe  
For there's not much else to do in this drab and colorless place  
We'll sit amongst the rubber tyres  
Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac  
People have no use for - amongst the smoldering embers of yesterday  
  
And when or if the sun shines  
Lighting our once beautiful features  
We'll smile but only for seconds  
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life  
A brave but useless show of compassion  
And that is forbidden in this drab and colorless world  
  
Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind  
The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war  
The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities  
Councils call homes  
  
And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen  
The holy Coca-Cola tins - the punctured footballs  
The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles  
We'll sit and probably hold hands  
  
And watch the rain fall - watch it - watch it  
Tumble and fall - tumble and falling  
Like our lives - like our lives  
Just like our lives  
  
We'll talk about the old days  
When the wasteland was release when we could play  
And think - without feeling guilty  
Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands  
Tumble and fall - tumble and falling  
Like our lives - like our lives  
Exactly like our lives

A forced expense  
But the big divide  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
Let's take a chance with beginner's luck  
We have nothing so there's nothing to lose  
I can't believe the only reasons we're here  
Are the reasons in the Bank of England

Any guitar and any bass drum  
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young  
Life is new and there's things to be done  
You can't wait to be grown up  
Acceptance into the capital world  
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young  
  
But you find out life isn't like that  
It's so hard to comprehend  
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end  
  
But you don't mind you've got time on your side  
And they're never gonna make you stand in line  
You're just waiting for the right time  
  
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young  
  
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone  
No corporations for the new age sons  
Tears of rage roll down your face  
But still you say ""it's fun""  
  
And you find out life isn't like that  
It's so hard to understand  
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam  
  
It's got you in its grip before your born  
It's done with the use of a dice and a board  
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn  
  
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young  
You used to fall in love with everyone  
Any guitar and any bass drum

James Taylor,A Junkie's Lament,/j/james+taylor/a+junkies+lament_20069149.html,"Ricky's been kicking the gong, lickity-split, didn't take too long.  
A junkie's sick, a monkey's strong, that's what's wrong.  
Well, I guess he's been messing around downtown, so sad to see the man losing
ground.  
Winding down behind closed doors on all fours.  
  
Mama, don't you call him my name, he can't hear you anymore.  
Even if he seems the same to you, that's a stranger to your door.  
Go on, ask him what's he come here for.  
  
Oh my God, a monkey can move a man. Send him to hell and home again.  
An empty hand in the afternoon, shooting for the moon.  
It's halfway sick and it's halfway stoned. He'd sure like to kick but he's too
far gone.  
They wind him down with the methadone, he's all on his own.  
  
But baby, don't you throw your love away, I hate to seem unkind.  
It's only that I understand the man that the monkey can leave behind,  
I used to think he was a friend of mine.

There ain't no rhyme or reason, ain't no time or season,  
Ain't no way around it, I know I would have found it.  
There ain't no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you.

Watch out, baby, here it comes,  
Right around the corner, here it comes,  
Just brighten your night with my day.

What a fool I was to leave the only happiness I've known.  
  
You see me coming, you wink your eye and call me Captain Jim.  
And when I don't do nothing but walk on by you say babe, get a load of him.  
All I need is the sea and the sky and I know where I stand.  
Instead of you hicks straight out of the sticks deciding I ain't a man.  
You'll never understand. Up here I'm a whisky bum but down there I'm a king.  
Sounds just like the angels up in heaven when they sing.  
Welcome home, welcome home. Such a sight to see.  
Instead of some Salvation Army sister singing ""Nearer My God To Thee.""  
  
Now I know that Yankee whisky has taken away my mind,  
And I know that rum is the only drink suitable to mankind.  
And I know this tree I'm under is shaped entirely wrong.  
I need to see a gentle palm tree and I won't wait to long.  
I can feel that it's coming on strong,  
The first cold wind of winter is flapping in my clothes  
Showing me the way with the direction that it blows,  
Welcome home, welcome home. Let it blow, welcome home, welcome home.  
Welcome home, Such a sight to see.

And back into the storm.  
She blew up over the San Juan Mountains,  
She spent herself at last.  
The threat of heavy weather,  
That was what she knew best.  
  
Oh, it's enough to be on your way,  
It's enough to cover ground,  
It's enough to be moving on.  
Home, build it behind your eyes,  
Carry it in your heart,  
Safe among your own.  
  
It woke me up on a Sunday,  
An hour before the sun.  
It had me watching the headlights  
Out on highway 591.  
Till I stepped into my trousers,  
Till I pulled my big boots on,  
I walked out on the Mesa  
And I stumbled on this song  
  
Oh, it's enough to be on your way,  
It's enough just to cover ground,  
It's enough to be moving on.  
Home, build it behind your eyes,  
Carry it in your heart,  
Safe among your own.  
So long, old gal.

Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way.  
  
Home is where they want you now,  
You can more or less assume that you'll be welcome in the end.  
Mustn't let King Herod haunt you so or fantasize his features when you're
looking at a friend.  
Well it pleasures me to be here and to sing this song tonight,  
They tell me that life is a miracle and I figured that they're right.  
But Herod's always out there, he's got our cards on file.  
It's a lead pipe cinch, if we give an inch, old Herod likes to take a mile.  
It's best to go home by another way, home by another way.  
We got this far to a lucky star, but tomorrow is another day.  
We can make it another way, safe home as they used to say.  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way.

She's a fireman's daughter.  
Yeah, but most of all,  
Jenny mulhenny loves to boil hot water  
  
Jenny put the kettle on, jellyman kelly,  
Can he come home, jenny, can he come?

Trying to keep her devils at bay, watching her health return.

I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, ""Please give me some medicine,

Where'd she get that tear in her eye?  
Whoever said she could leave me, where'd she learn to say good-bye?  
She's been watching too much T.V., she only shows up for meals,  
my medicine chest and my automobiles. Johnnie comes back again.  
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, ""Please give me some medicine,

Oh Johnnie comes back again.  
  
Me, I'm just an evil demon, I'm playing on her weakness,  
counting on her sickness to bring her home again.  
  
To use me up and to rob me blind, I guess it shouldn't surprise me.  
Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line, my God, she must despise me.  
But she always comes back again, now it won't be long 'til she's gone again,

Felt like a festival  
And it felt like a Christmas morning,  
Felt the darkness fall away  
Even as the world was turning on,

He's disposed of all his inner mind,  
Donned his mask and left the world behind.  
He has cancelled all the checks he signed,  
So why be kind this time?  
You can't see the picture of you in his hand.

up on the hill,  
I know the river and the railroad would run through the valley still.

The kind of place young people want to leave today,  
Store fronts pretty much boarded up, Main Street pretty much closed down.  
The church bell still rings on Sunday, old folks still go, the young ones
listen on the radio.  
Saturday night nothing but a stray dog running wild like nobody's child.  
  
And little by little, light after light, that's how it died.  
They say you never go home again, that's no lie.  
Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail,  
It's a matter of time until you can do a little bit better time.  
  
It used to be part of the heartland, awful proud and strong.  
But deep, deep down peaceful and serene.  
When people used to talk about the country that's what they used to mean.  
I might go down come the weekend, go on my own,  
Drop off Annie and the baby, maybe drive alone.  
Pay my last respects to a time that has all but gone.  
We said, Mama come look at the mountain, fire in the sky, it's lit up like the
Fourth of July,  
The mill burning down, the jobs leaving town, the trains rolling by.

Don't let the woman put you six feet  
In the ground, Machine Gun.  
  
I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly,  
Tired of being such small time, now.

Make it in the world of crime.

Don't let the woman put you six feet  
In the ground, Machine Gun.  
  
You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly,  
Careful of what you do, now.  
If you keep listening to your old lady,  
Ain't no telling  
What'll happen to you, now, Machine Gun.  
  
The government boys they came  
For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.  
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison  
Where he lived until his dying day.

Don't let her put you down.  
Don't let a woman make you  
Out to be a clown, Machine Gun.

All I've got to do is the best I can, if I can  
Got a dog named David,  
Got a bird named Dinah,  
Got a birthmark on my thigh  
In the shape of mainland China  
Got a somewhat southern accent  
Cause I come from Carolina,  
And if you want to find us,  
We'll be walking right behind you.  
  
I hear horns, I hear voices, I hear strings,  
Seems I was born with too many choices  
Now what am I going to do with all these extra things,  
As they serve to confuse me, really  
It's me and my guitar,  
Essentially me and my guitar  
Oh, maybe a few friends fall by for tea,  
A little bit of ""who do you love?""  
But pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,  
It's me and my guitar  
Having fun, boogie-woogie, uh-huh,

I was an ornery cuss,  
I was a dismal Dan,  
I made an awful fuss.  
Ever since my life began, man,  
It was ever thus,  
I was a nasty tyke  
Who was hard to like.  
I had to misbehave,  
I did things in reverse,  
Refused to wash or shave,  
I was horrid to my nurse.  
I got back what I gave  
Which only made me worse,  
I had to have my way  
Which was bleak and gray.  
  
Oh dear, living in here,  
One hundred years of rain.  
Such a drag, this riches to rags  
With just myself to blame,  
A dirty low-down shame.  
  
Silly me, silly old me,  
Somewhere outside my mind.  
Clever you walking me through,  
Willing to lead the blind  
Just in the nick of time.

Who gets to have some fun?  
Who gets to learn to dance  
Before his race is run?

Till you turned him into  
A golden retriever puppy dog?

It's out of you hands it's over for now.  
  
Leave behind what you can,  
You can always return

Unspoken but loud and clear,

Unsung song, how I long to play the changes

But when we thirst in this dry night  
We drink from hot wells poisoned with the blood of children  
And when we strain to hear a steady homing beam  
Our ears are balked by stiffled moans  
And howls of desolation from the throats of sisters, brother, wild men  
Clawing at the gates for bread  
Even our own feeble hands  
Aim to seize the crown you wear  
And work our private havoc through  
The known and unknown lands of space  
Absolute in flame beyond us  
Seed and source of Dark and Day  
Maker whom we beg to be  
Our mother, father, comrade, mate  
Til our few atoms blow to dust  
Or form again in wiser lives  
Or find your face and hear our name  
In your calm voice the end of night  
If dark may end

Don't make me remember the Alamo, I'm feeling like a little bit of Cotton Eyed
Joe.  
No raging Cajun crawfish stew, fat batter coming in a Lumalamalu.  
Boy howdy and howdy damn do, something like fine setting eyes on you.  
Let me come down, I won't never go back up again, oh, hold me down.  
Let me come home, I won't never go away no more, oh let me come down.  
  
In a younger day back in Tennessee, the muddy Mississippi used to call to me,  
Float on a river and set yourself free.  
Run from the farm and the family tree, run from the runaway boy.  
  
So I've been all the places that I ever want to be, I've seen all the people
that I ever want to see.  
I'm sick and tired of being lonely and free, I'm ready today for what's
waiting on me.  
I'm gonna give up believing I was born to run, stop acting like a man that
gets shot from a gun.  
I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up sun and stay right here until my
days are done.  
Let me back down, I will never go up again. Hold me down, tie me on down.  
Let me go home, I will never go away no more, oh let me come home, oh let me
go down.

All men shall be sailors then  
Until the sea shall free them  
But he himself was broken  
Long before the sky's would open

And she shows you where to look  
Among the garbage and the flowers  
There are heroes in the seaweed  
There are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love  
They will lean that way forever  
While Suzanne holds the mirror

It seems ""learn not to burn""  
Means to turn on a dime  
And walk on if you're walking  
Even if it's an uphill climb.  
And try to remember that working's no crime,  
Just don't let 'em take and waste your time.  
That's why I'm here.  
  
This is an IOU, I reckon I owe you one now.  
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria,  
This'll be better tomorrow.  
  
Fortune and fame's such a curious game.  
Perfect strangers can call you by name.  
Pay good money to hear fire and rain again  
And again and again.  
Some are like summer coming back every year,  
Got your baby, got your blanket  
Got your bucket of beer.  
I break into a grin from ear to ear  
And suddenly it's perfectly clear.  
That's why I'm here.  
  
This is the part about Kitty and Jim,  
He loved her and she loved him.  
Wake 'em up shake 'em up the middle of the night,  
Got to tell me everything's alright.  
He said that's why I'm here. That's right.

I can't cross over,  
And neither have I wings to fly.  
Build me a boat  
That can carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I.  
  
There is a ship  
And she sails the sea.  
She's loaded deep,  
As deep can be.  
But not so deep  
As the love I'm in,  
I know not how I sink or swim.  
  
Oh love is handsome  
And love is fine,  
The sweetest flower  
When first it's new.  
But love grows old  
And waxes cold  
And fades away like Summer dew.  
  
Build me a boat  
That can carry two  
And both shall row, my love and I,  
And both shall row, my love and I.

And the time will go by  
Till you never know where it's gone.  
Talk to me and I'll tell you my life story.  
Walk with me and I'll tell you my dreams of glory.  
There we are walking hand in hand,  
Somewhere on the sand  
At the end of the land  
And the edge of the shining sea.  
  
Drifting through time and space  
On the face of a little blue ball  
Falling around the sun.  
One in a million, billion twinkling lights  
Shining out for no one in the middle of the night.  
Here we are, sparks in the darkness,  
Speaking of our love  
Burning down forever and forever.  
  
Oh, I don't know if I told you,  
But you hold my heart in your hand.  
And I found out something about you, baby,  
Without you.  
I'm a lonely man.  
  
So though I never say that I love you,  
I love you, darling I do, Carly, I do love you.  
And though we are as nothing  
To the stars that shine above,  
You are my universe, you are my love.  
Here we are, like children forever,  
Taking care of one another  
While the world goes on without us,  
All around us.

And I've, well I've seen a thousand things in one place  
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face  
Erasing memory, well I feel as though I've never seen a face before  
Until I saw your eyes  
And they're smiling back at me through my tears  
I've been counting all these years, oh  
Suddenly the thousand things I've seen were nothing more than dreams of  
Of you and me  
You and me  
Quietly at a standstill now  
Fortunately you will, well you'll kiss me, I will  
I will kiss you back  
Oh the fact of the matter is  
And I don't know what the latter is, oh no way  
See, I've always wanted to kiss you  
But I, I always wanted to run from you  
Because I've always wanted to miss you  
And I, I always wanted to come for you  
""Well I love my comfort foods,"" you said  
While you always say, ""How do you do?""

I'm sorry for wasting your time.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my job to make the most of it  
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.  
  
Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything that's great  
But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away?  
So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make
it  
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my time to make the most of

Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I
bought it for  
Pay no more than absolutely zero.  
  
Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away  
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game that's made for two that's

The rules remain a mystery. See it can be easy.  
  
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's our time to make the most of

Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults  
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall  
Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart  
Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.  
  
But there is something in the way you laugh  
That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me.  
  
After an afternoon with you  
And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling  
After an afternoon.  
  
Face to palm  
Tear to tear  
Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground  
I am in love.

Allowing time and space to bring you closer to everlasting love  
So what should you do if god moves through you?  
  
When love beckons its ways are often hard and steep  
And his wings unfold, ye yield to all that it speaks  
Though a sword it might be hidden there among the pinions  
Oh you, may wear a wound that truly spoke to you  
Believe in all that voice and follow through

Love possesses nothing  
Nor would it ever be possessed  
Love is love sufficient unto love

Maybe the daughter, the son of a beginning  
They'll come through your womb but not be coming from you  
They will be with you but they do not belong to you  
  
You can give them your love but not your thoughts  
'Cause they'll arrive with their own hearts  
They're the coming of angels this blessed season

Motorcycles and for sure the Eiffel Tower  
They were made for two  
A double bed has never felt so empty  
What's missing in the world is you  
So I'll leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
  
I like climbing the mountain  
I'm climbing back in the bed  
I love making breakfast for someone instead of me  
  
Taking autumn walks in Central Park  
They were made for two  
Afternoon naps have never felt so crappy  
What's missing in my life is you  
So I'll leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
I'm gonna it in your hands now  
To come through  
  
It's like diving into a pool without water  
And praying for rain  
Well, my life is a good life anyway  
What I have will do  
But when you're alone  
You're living in a world with only choices  
And what I choose is you  
So I'll leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
I'll leave it in your hands now  
To come through

Jason Mraz,It's Gonna Be A Good Day,/j/jason+mraz/its+gonna+be+a+good+day_21062531.html,"Verse  
Fall out of bed and catch a fading star  
Fancy I woke up before my alarm  
Brought my mind through my eyes  
It's the best I can do  
Before it's automatic, hand it over, turn it to you  
Though her smile when it happens, almost as if it was magic  
It means there's a god somewhere and he's laughing  
And I shuffle my slipperless toes to the kitchen  
Still low to the ground, but high on living  
Chorus  
And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Verse  
Waking up and stretch my body  
And acknowledge the makes  
It must be something I did yesterday  
Pour a cup of liquid gold  
'Cause my engine's still cold  
And in a minute everything's gonna change  
Chorus  
'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Yes I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
[instrumental]  
Verse  
Looking out from a... [?] watching the band of the  
Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt  
I can see from the depths of my readjustinize of reflection  
Of yes's and that ever changing sky  
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake?  
I don't need no scenes of valid paying replayed (??)  
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray  
But my thoughts are all I've got so I try to make them brave  
Chorus  
'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
I say, hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Oh now this is what I've been waiting for  
(this is what I've been waiting for)  
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)  
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)

The seed is sown, all alone  
It grows above, with a heart of love  
Sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing

He said, you've got to love yourself  
  
You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak  
But keep your tongue up in your cheek  
And if you stumble on to  
You better remember that it's humble that you seek  
You got all the skill you need,  
Individuality  
You got something  
Call it gumption  
Call it anything you want  
Because when you play the fool now  
You're only fooling everyone else  
You're learning to love yourself  
  
There's no price to pay  
When you give and what you take,  
That's why it's easy to thank you  
You  
  
Let's say take a break from the day  
And get back to the old garage  
Because life's too short anyway  
But at least it's better then average  
As long as you got me  
And I got you  
You know we'll got a lot to go around  
I'll be your friend  
Your other brother  
Another love to come and comfort you  
And I'll keep reminding  
If it's the only thing I ever do  
I will always love  
I will always love you  
Yes you  
I will always, always, always, always love  
I will always, always love  
I will always, always love, love

Oh baby we can fight like dogs we can fight like cats  
A dirty laundry needs a laundry man  
Maybe the king and the queen should lay off the caffeine  
Baby breathe before you react  
  
Sometimes we do forget to behave  
And we regret what we say  
Cause words are too weapons  
If we don't choose'em carefully  
Ladies and gentlemen this is instrumental  
If life's to be a bed of roses  
  
I know I gave you everything you like  
Because you still give me butterflies  
  
If we just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
Then the world would be a better place for you and I  
If we just live our lives  
Putting our differences aside  
Oh that would be so beautiful to me  
  
Are we just dangling in the middle of a galaxy  
Well I'm stoked on gravity  
To be stuck with you like flowers on the dew drops  
Now let it in my direction  
My direction is up when everybody's down  
Cause I don't mind being anybody's clown  
I love a little lift cause I'm an optimistic  
In an altruistic way  
  
Cause basically this place is needing instruments of harmony  
  
Spreading my philosophy of love and inspiration  
Oh these words I speak I commit to like a crime  
With a rhythm I deliver I'm giving them a picture  
Of the reasons why  
  
We should just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
So the world could be a better place for you and I  
If we just live our lives  
Putting our differences aside  
Oh that would be so beautiful to me  
  
Well it wouldn't cost a penny but could save so many lonely lives  
From teary eyes  
If we just try try try  
To open up a can of understanding open up your heart  
I'm just planting seeds  
Cause I believe  
  
We could just try try try  
Just to be ni-ni-nice  
So the world would be a better place for you and I

Follow you I will so lets get moving  
  
Who needs shelter when the mornings coming?  
Absolutely there's no one  
Who needs shelter from the sun?  
Not me, no. not anyone.  
  
By your clock the cock rooster crows  
Then off to work where everybody goes  
Slow, But eventually they get there  
Picking up the day shift back where all left off  
Confined and pecking at relationships  
You know it's only a worthless piece of shit  
  
Who needs shelter when the mornings coming?  
Absolutely there's no one  
Who needs shelter from the sun?

And someone said that in my scene

Like a new religion  
Music for the television  
I can't do the long division  
Someone do the math  
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer

It always seems to be a flowin'

Keeps the melodies inside me  
And they're comin'  
Til I'm running out of air  
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head  
Are you listening to a single word I've said  
  
Listen closer to the words I say

And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  
And balancing the whole thing

And the bright lights turn to night  
Until the dawn it brings  
A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me

What you and I spoke of  
What you and I spoke of  
Others only dream of the love that I love

Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words  
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards  
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so live  
Now you and I, you and I  
Not so little you and I anymore  
And with this silence brings a moral story  
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

Well I'm already finally out of  
  
And it's okay if you have go away  
Just remember the telephone works both ways  
And if I never ever hear it ring  
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside  
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay

That a love like ours shall never fall apart  
You're so afraid of the rain  
So I'll take your hand  
And I'll love you in the best way that I can  
And I only expect the same

Don't promise me forever  
Don't promise me the sun and sky  
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry  
Just hold me now  
And promise me you'll try  
  
Though I'm sure of what I feel  
Never though a love so true that felt so unreal  
And I'm a little afraid myself  
But if you love me day by day  
With all honest heart and a little faith  
Baby time will tell the tale

At Mann's Chinese Theatre show

They were crying to the camera  
Said he never fitted in  
He wasn't welcomed  
He showed up to the parties  
He was hanging in  
Some guys puttin' him down  
Bullying him round round  
Now I wish I woulda talked to him  
Gave him the time of day  
Not turn away  
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far  
He might have stayed at home  
Playing angry chords on his guitar

Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside  
Things, I know we can't deny  
  
Should've never told you that I cared about you  
Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you, should've never held your hand  
Got to find a way to let these feelings go  
  
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul?  
It was then when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
No one else can know of the things that we've been saying  
On the telephone, it would be so bad if they ever knew  
That me and you were secretly into each other  
  
Should've never told you that I cared about you  
Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you, should've never held your hand  
Got to find a way to let these feelings go  
  
I'm so scared, trembling inside 'cause I'm feeling  
Like somebody else already knows  
Oh my God, I love you both so much  
But to have to choose between the two  
Is hurting me so deep inside  
  
Should've never told you that I cared about you  
Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you, should've never held your hand

Like I lost time an empty steam  
Of thoughts runnin through my head  
And I wake and wish world was dead  
  
Turn turnin in to sunlight  
My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight  
I bloom with flower  
Soft the rain  
I'm stern like a tower

I cry  
Cry with the wolves they stare  
And I think am I really there  
  
Walk down arond and around  
The people talking but theres no sound  
Climbing the mountain swimin the ocean  
Cry but see nothing is there some solotion  
  
Look down around  
Why can't I fall into picture

Dusty haze on summer highways  
Sweet magnolia callin'

But now and then I find myself  
Thinkin' of the days  
That (when) we were walking in  
The Alabama rain  
  
Drive-in movies, Friday nights  
Drinkin' beer and laughin'  
Somehow things were always right  
I just don't know what happened

We were only kids  
But then I've never heard it said  
That kids can't fall in love  
And feel the same  
I can still remember the first time  
I told you ""I love you""  
  
On a dusty mid-July  
Country summer's evenin's  
Weepin' willows sang its lullaby  
And shared our secret

Walking in the Alabama rain

Between a thousand railroad ties  
From Boston down to New Orleans  
I left the girls a cryin'  
But I've still got some ramblin' in me  
Got some miles left on my shoes  
And before I take a job again  
I'll have to be low-down  
Cryin' the blues  
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'  
If I miss the train I'll have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
I'll be off to another day in another town  
  
You say you'd like to ramble with me  
This ain't no life for a girl  
Too many people out to get you in a hobo's world  
And it gets mighty cold when you're on the road  
'Cause a boxcar never was a home  
But you could join me if you want  
I'm gettin' mighty tired of bein' alone

And the trouble soon began  
Cause Leroy Brown learned a lesson  
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

Tinseled afternoons

There walks a lonely man  
And if I told you who he is  
Well, I think you'd understand

Now his kingdom has fallen  
And it's really quite a tragic tale  
Cause he built a castle to harbor his queen  
But the queen claimed he built her a jail  
  
He struggled so hard to be king  
He wanted everything  
He built her a house by the sea  
Just to keep her in

He forgot she needed a friend  
Now his kingdom has fallen  
And it's really quite a tragic tale  
Cause he built a castle to harbor his queen  
And the queen claimed he built her a jail  
  
It happened so quickly before he could know  
She was gone, far gone  
Far from the castle, the diamonds and things  
She had worn to the ball  
There was a note that she carefully wrote  
Signed it best wishes to all  
Oh you struggled so hard to be king  
Working night and day  
Dreaming of only one thing, never a holiday  
Somewhere along the way  
You forgot that I needed a man

And his family and friends saw him annually  
And they say it's a shame what's become of the king

To lay down the truth  
To so very many who cared  
To carry the cross

Toujours verte  
Et la fete ne s'arretait jamais  
A autour do rocher  
  
This a a little tale about a hotel in the Caribbean.  
Well it wasn't really a hotel, it was a patio  
Bar with funky rooms and an outdoor disco  
With bad wiring. Some people said if you looked  
Between the cracks of the floorboards of our  
Dance floor you would see Hell. If you ever  
Went there, you would know what I'm talking  
About. If you never had, then we  
Thought we'd send you a little musical souvenir.  
  
Some say it was a planet  
Some say it was a rock  
For five wild years in L""Orient  
The party never stopped  
  
There were pirates from the Indies  
There were models from Paris  
There were locals and New Yorkers  
And the Brazilian Navy  
  
By mini-moke and scooters  
In cabs and stolen cars  
Came the creatures of the evening  
From St. Martin and from Mars  
  
Alors, Alors, Alors, Alors alors come on, come on  
Vien faire un tour autour do rocher  
On croisera les fantomes do passe

Girl at the pool table  
Puts on a show for free  
They were bivouacked in the bathroom  
By the hot tub near the sea  
  
Every night at midnight  
Seems the devil took control  
And the hill became a parking lot  
Fueled by rock 'n' roll  
  
They were talking by the cannon  
But I couldn't believe my ears  
The Russian had plutonium  
The sailor wanted beers  
  
They shook hands in the moonlight  
And broke out a big cigar  
Just business as usual  
Beneath the tropic stars

Vien faire in tour autour do rocher

Viens faire un tour autour do richer

It was better than a painting  
At le Musee de Beaux Arts  
And simply what we did for fun  
Back in the old St. Barts  
  
Then the glitz and all the glamour  
Hit like a hurricane  
Or maybe we just all grew up  
But it never was the same  
  
The gendarmes finally closed the joint  
And the fire it did the rest  
But on New Year's Eve of '91  
We sang the last request  
  
We were dancing in the ashes  
We were dancing in the sea  
We were dancing in the ruins  
Where we left our memories  
Come on let's go alors

She was the sweetest thing, I declare,  
That the summer breeze ever blown my way

Gravity never could hold me

So come to the moon

Half a million miles isn't far to go  
You know I need you so  
So come to the moon  
The starship's leaving soon  
Until then I'm just wishing on every star  
You will be here real soon  
Come to the Moon  
  
Those crazy Martian days  
We went our separate ways...  
Time and space we'll find a place  
To bring our lives in phase  
We're lost amid the galaxies revolving  
And we're all just a part of what's evolving  
Evolving  
So come to the moon

Lovely dancers swaying to an island lullaby  
Beside the southern ocean taking stock of what's to be  
Writing you this letter that you'll probably never see  
  
But I can't help but be  
Ruled by inconsistency  
Not unique just distantly in love  
  
Tried to phone from Paris thinking  
Things could be arranged  
Me and you could rendezvous  
But I found your number changed  
So I drove to San Remo where  
The crazy painter dwells  
And toasted our old photographs  
Still up there on his shelf  
  
But I can't help but be  
Ruled by my antiquity  
Not unique just distantly in love  
I can't be the one to fill  
Your times and all your places  
I can't be the one to fill  
Your blanks and empty spaces  
  
I heard it from a friend of ours  
I saw in Timber Bay  
That you had a new lover who had  
Stolen you away  
That could be be the reason that  
I never got in touch  
And may present slight problems  
If he loves you half as much

Ruled by inconsistency

""If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain  
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain  
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean  
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine  
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad  
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad  
  
Yes, I like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain  
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne  
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape  
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape  
  
So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place  
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face  
It was my own lovely lady and she said, ""Oh, it's you""  
And we laughed for a moment and I said, ""I never knew  
  
That you liked Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain

Though the ocean was all motion and the wind was brisk  
The deadly gunboats never saw them in the pale moonlight  
They were off to Cayo Hueso by the dawns early light  
The gringo in the garden called the customs man  
They answered all his questions, were allowed to land  
The ladies shared a hairbrush and their husbands had a coke  
Then they were taken up to Krome to meet with their kin folk  
  
Everybody's got a cousin in Miami  
Everybody understands the impromptu  
Dancing in the heat to the beat  
That turns your clothing clammy  
Everybody needs to have a dream come true  
  
In a third world jungle not so far away  
Lives a natural drummer with a dream to play  
He's the brother of the lizard and the flying fish  
But he's been enchanted by the pictures  
From the satellite dish  
So his mama packs his bags, knots his red neck tie  
Sends him north to her relations with a kiss good-bye  
He's bewildered by the plane ride and the immigration line  
Until he sees his Christian name upon a cardboard sign  
  
Everybody's got a cousin in Miami  
Everybody is an Aborigine  
Dancing in the heat to the beat  
That turns your clothing clammy

It's hard to believe the city started as a trading post  
Home to the Seminole, pirate and pioneer  
Between the river of grass and the old mosquito coast  
Before the railroad claimed the southernmost frontier  
  
I am umbilically connected to the temperate zone  
It brought me life, it brought me love  
I never have outgrown  
It brought me one too many nights along that Biscayne shore  
And one too many mornings in the Grove Drug Store  
In one way or the other we're all refugees  
Living out this easy life below the banyan trees  
Smoothing off the rougher edges of the culture clash  
We got a style, we got a look  
We got that old panache

On the old Chicamauga the Signal Jacks flew  
And the message they spelled out caused a great bally hoo  
Every ship in Havana then hoisted away

Witnessed storms and starvation natural wonders and force

Where he raised up his family taught us all to survive

Now the old Chicamauga has slipped by the ways  
She lies on the bottom of old Mobile Bay  
Where the ghosts of his father and his brother are near  
They protect him and tell him there's nothin' to fear  
Cause it's family tradition we take to the sea  
And it's a time in the future for Cameron and me

Jimmy Buffett,Havana Daydreamin',/j/jimmy+buffett/havana+daydreamin_20071965.html,"Stashed his trash in Ecuador, bought a good suit of clothes.  
Flew on up to Mexico, standin' by the shore.  
Waiting for some mystery man, to pay him for his time.  
Thinkin' about all the money he made,  
couldn't help to ease his mind  
Havana daydreamin' oh he's just dreamin' his life away.  
  
Daddy shucked that sugar cane,  
One day he fell dead.  
Jesus had a wanderin' feelin'  
Swimmin around in his head.  
Sailin' on a midnight boat,  
There were no questions asked,  
Water's so green and the air was so clean  
That he stuck right to his task, Havana daydreamin',  
Oh he's just schemin', his life away.  
  
Ceilin' fan stirs the air  
Cigar smoke did swirl,  
A fragrance on the pillow case  
And he thinks about the girl.  
Spillin' wine wine and sharin' good times  
She sure could make him smile.  
He pays her well but what the hell  
He'll be movin' in a little while, Havana daydreamin',  
Havana daydreamin'  
Oh he'll be dreamin' his life away.

Jimmy Buffett,He Went To Paris,/j/jimmy+buffett/he+went+to+paris_20071804.html,"He went to Paris  
Looking for answers  
To questions that bothered him so  
  
He was impressive  
Young and aggressive  
Savin' the world on his own  
But the warm summer breezes  
The French wines and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
His summers and winters  
Scattered like splinters  
And four to five years slipped away  
  
Then he went to England  
Played the piano  
And married an actress named Kim  
They had a fine life, she was a good wife  
And bore him young son named Jim  
And all of the answers, and all the questions  
He locked in his attic one day  
'Cause he liked the quiet  
Clean country livin' and  
Twenty more years slipped away  
  
Well, the war took his baby  
Bombs killed his lady  
And left him with only one eye  
His body was battered  
His whole world was shattered  
And all he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling and he was recalling  
Answers he'd never found  
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound  
  
Now he lives in the islands  
Fishes the pilings  
And drinks his green label each day  
Writing his memoirs  
Losin' his hearin'  
But he don't care what most people say  
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion  
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,  
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic  
But I had a good life all of the way.""  
  
And he went to Paris  
Lookin' for answers to questions  
That bothered him so

Here we are

Who would have thought this game, this flame would still be burning  
Who would have guessed that all these blenders would still be churning  
Not even we on our bended knees could have ever blessed it  
Not even I with my head in the sky could have ever guessed it  
  
But here we are, for a family reunion, costume barbeque  
All the black sheep, family outcasts, and a freak or two  
  
No the hat tricks and the gold bricks still don't have us down  
Still a party, we are the hearty when we come to town  
You're still grinning and we're still winning, nothing left to say  
I'm still gliding as I go flying down this endless wave  
  
And here we are, we're the offbeat Uncle Freds who spill their wine on you  
And the in-your-face Aunt Rachels with an attitude  
All the ones that use your bathroom then eat all your food  
We're the dreamy Deadheads who just like us and Dave Matthews  
  
Here we are, maybe it's because in spite of all the work we do  
It's the child in us we really value  
Here we are, with our fins up and our feathers flashing  
Here we are, with our coconut shell brassieres chanting  
  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are

You need a holiday, take a holiday

Where you might regain command of your life today  
Take a holiday, you need a holiday

But you can't really own that rock  
It's just a waste of time.

So I asked him while he swept

It's my job to be better than the rest  
And that makes the day for me""

And that's the thing people respect in me  
It's a job but without it I'd be less  
Than what I expect from me""

Writing songs and sleeping late  
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake  
If street sweepers can smile then  
I've got no right to feel upset  
But sometimes I still forget  
Till the lights go on and the stage is set  
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat

Waitresses are picking up glasses,  
The bartender screamed last call.  
When I looked to my right I saw a terrible sight  
And the bass man took a bad fall.  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning,  
Running on adrenalin.  
What I'm trying to say is that tomorrow's the day  
And we've got to do it over again.

And there are places that still stand out to me  
But nowhere else can quite compare  
To my island in the sea  
  
My personal utopia a place to run to  
Where I can hide away  
Where I can truly reign supreme  
somewhere fresh and clean  
Where a man can dream

makes me start to lose control  
I could melt right on the spot

Someday I hope to find my queen  
I know she'll come my way  
I'll give her all my love

just a place where I can swing  
Where a man can be a king

Just crusin' to the sound of the big deisel boom  
It's not close quarters that would make me snap  
It's just dealing with the daily unadulterated crap  
  
Sail away for a month at a time,  
Sail away I've got to recharge mind  
Then you'll find me back at it again

The mid morning watch is the best time to look  
Oh what would they do if I wrote the big book  
  
'Cause I've seen incredible things in my year  
Somedays were laughter, others were tears  
If I had it all to do over again  
I'd just get myself drunk and I'd jump right back in  
  
Sail away, that's the way I survive  
Sail away, that's just no shuck and jive  
It just makes my whole life come alive  
  
The wind whistled threw the cool rigging at night  
Crazy crowds boogie to the sound and the lights

She walks along the boulevard, Champs Alysee  
Thinks about a country boy three thousand miles away  
Pride is such a hard thing, it's such a price to pay  
To be all alone in Paris with true love so far away  
  
Up upon Mont Martre when she stops to rest awhile  
All the artists look at her and they long to paint her smile  
For even in her sorrow there's something in her eyes  
That makes the young men jealous, makes the old men sigh  
  
They say the loss of innocence is always linked to pain  
For once the heart is opened nothing ever is the same  
And so the evening lends itself to lovers and romance  
The way to heal a broken heart is to give true love  
One more chance

Try to get quiet, you'll miss out on something  
Like someone who's looking for  
Someone who's looking...  
  
There, I almost got caught again  
Lost in the night all alone  
With nowhere to hide, crying inside  
A wild heart looking for home  
  
Sleeping without you is always cold  
The nights are so dark and so long  
Dreaming of touching your face in the moonlight  
Filling the silence with song  
  
Living without you the days are endless  
The clock winding steadily down  
Imagining footsteps, your hand at the gatepost  
The wind shuts the open door  
the wind shuts the open...  
There, I almost got caught again  
Lost in the night all alone  
With nowhere to hide, crying inside  
A wild heart looking for home  
  
The songbird, she trembles all day long  
She sings as if her poor heart must break  
Watching the freedom that flies past her window  
Dreaming won't fit in a cage  
  
Fly away songbird, the wind she loves you  
Your prison is forsaken at last  
Follow your dreaming, you're bound up to heaven  
You're reaching for something more  
Reaching for something...

With nowhere to hide, crying inside

A vision to have and to hold  
My spirit still sings, I'm flying again

Who just didn't want to change the show  
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels  
He liked bicycles and snow  
He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears  
And critters and creatures that crawled  
Why bugs were some of his very best friends  
Spiders and ants and all  
Now that's not to say that he ever looked down  
On a vision of twinkled lights  
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes  
And a thousand other delights  
And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer  
And a jolly old man in a sleigh  
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things  
And a story of Christmas day  
Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright  
He was full of Christmas cheer  
All of each and every day  
And all throughout the year  
To Him it was more than a special time  
Much more than a special day  
It was more than a beautiful story  
It was a special kind of way  
You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring  
And they've never heard of Santa Claus  
They've never heard the story of the Son Of God  
And that made Alfie pause  
Did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth  
Or the brotherhood of man  
Or know how to love, or know how to give  
If they can't, no one can  
You see, life is a very special kind of thing  
Not just for a chosen few  
But for each and every living, breathing thing  
Not just me and you  
So when you're at Christmas prayers this year  
Alfie asked me if I'd ask you  
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood  
And those who live there too

Back where night has fallen and it's still Christmas Eve  
And snow is on the mountains where I always hate to leave  
Here I am down under with a brand new family  
And Christmas bells are ringing and there's presents 'neath the tree  
I know that it's been said before and now I know it's true  
That home is where the heart is and Christmas lives there too  
On this morning Peace On Earth is still our fervent prayer  
And I can hear it being whispered softly everywhere  
And guns are called to silence and anger called to still  
And brotherhood and sisterhood surrounded by goodwill  
Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land  
A breeze upon the water, rainfall upon the sand  
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man  
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land

If I am your sign  
Don't try to understand it girl  
When I draw the line

That you can say I waste my time  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
For the skies they look so lazy now  
Heavy are the clouds  
There's nothing here that I could learn  
Or what it's all about  
You haven't said a thing to me  
And you talk so very loud  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
Well I think I'll try the circus  
Or go back to Mexico  
It's time to make mistakes again  
It's time to change the show  
It's time and time and time again  
To find another way  
It's time to gather forces  
And get out of yesterday  
  
Because I lost what I was looking for  
There's nothing left to share  
I need to take myself away  
To be some other where  
A face, a life, a minute more  
I don't think I can spare  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
'Cause I tell you when you hurt me  
And you just don't seem to know  
I inform you that I'm lonely  
And you still don't think I'll go  
So if I lie to you and smile a thought  
It's only half way here  
It's just the circus and I'm singing I'm never really near  
  
If I look like home to you  
If I am your sign  
Don't try to understand it girl  
When I draw the line  
It hasn't come to this

like seasons in the wind  
All across the water the clouds are sailin'

All I want to do is try to find myself  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
  
In searchin' for the way to go I've followed all the rules  
The way they say to choose between the wise men and the fools  
I listened to the words they say  
I read what I should read  
I do whatever's right to do  
Try to be what I should be  
Someone let me in I think the sky is falling  
Seems I've gotten lost on my way  
All I want to do is try to find myself  
Come and let me look in your eyes  
But wisdom isn't underground, nor on a mountainside  
Where am I to take myself, there's no place here to hide Where can I hide  
All across the universe the stars are fadin' seems I've gotten lost on my way  
All I want to do is try to find myself

Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs

Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home  
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove  
When Nashville night's the question, the answer's country love  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen

There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name  
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she  
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range  
  
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy  
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down  
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights  
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town  
  
She was courted by Young Vandamere  
A fine lad was he as I am to hear  
He gave her silver rings and lacy things  
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year  
  
But her pony did stumble and she did fall  
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us one and all  
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain  
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall  
  
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through  
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too  
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round  
And to young Vandy whose love was true

I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find  
The answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed  
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need  
  
Or is it really love itself that always wants to give  
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives  
  
Hey there, Mr. Cold, Cold Heart, I know I could be wrong  
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong  
As to gather everyone of us, like one big family  
To share with one another all we have and all we see  
  
It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same  
And that the only differences are really just the names  
  
We can join the children's song and show them that we care  
Let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where  
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile  
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile  
  
True love is still the answer, and we are still the way  
The gift is in the giving, and in living what we say  
  
And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you  
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do  
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed  
  
Is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
It's in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

Swept her up on his own  
  
Tumbleweeds were meant to  
Get stuck up on a fence

You've got no wire to roll against  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Don't let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains  
  
Worlds out there are waiting  
Big and wild as the sky  
No more hesitating  
It's now or never, do or die  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Don't let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains  
  
As hard as you imagined  
It being without me  
We'll both be wishing it were that easy  
Don't give me a pull, give me some room  
When this round up is through, I'll be coming back home  
  
Wide open spaces  
Between these two prairie hearts  
Wondering where their place is  
In a world so far apart  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Don't let go of the reigns

I need some things to hide the failure  
Of my garden, and the way it grew  
Oh baby, I didn't know I could depend on you

On the ocean in the setting sun

About living the way I do

Some will find the emptiness inside  
By giving it all for the things that they believe

Maybe it's just my style  
Maybe it's juat the freedom that I've found

Of living up to the dream in me  
You know I'll be reaching for higher ground

I will live up to the vision  
I will trust in what I feel

John Denver,Hitchhiker,/j/john+denver/hitchhiker_20073827.html,"If your driving down the road and you come across an old man  
Holding out his thumb in the wind  
His clothes are old and dirty and dirty that doesn't matter  
It's his eyes that tell where he's been  
If you're not afraid to take your chances on a stranger  
He might have some company to lend  
Why don't you pull off to the side and let that old man have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker  
The highway is the only home I know  
Where you're headed I don't mind  
I ain't been there in some time  
And it's just exactly where I want to go  
  
I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker  
Drawing people in from far and wide  
They never did regret the dollar that it cost 'em  
We always left 'em feeling good inside  
We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer  
Her beauty it was more than I can say  
Then one summer night she set my soul on fire  
Lord, I wish that she was here with me today  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker, I wonder what's a waiting 'round the bend  
I don't know what I might see and I don't need no guarantee  
Just a ride from here to there and back again  
  
I was only seventeen when I took the open highway  
Took it for my teacher and a friend  
I've been thirty years a-thumbing  
Some might call it bumming  
But it's better than just crying in the wind  
So if you're driving down the road and you come across an old man holding out
his thumb in the rain  
Why don't you pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker looking to the far side of the hill  
Some people say I'll settle down  
Build a home in some small town  
But within my heart I know I never will  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker

Looking up at the Spanish window  
From a trail on the edge of the timberline  
I've been off on a journey to find myself  
Maybe find my way back home  
Been many an hour all by myself  
In the darkest of nights  
I was never ever alone  
  
Back in the San Juan Mountains again  
On a ride with some good old boys  
Telling stories around a campfire  
The sound of laughter is the loudest noise  
There's something in a night in the wilderness  
It's a magical thing to me  
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter  
And your life is everything that you'd like it to be  
  
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again  
  
I guess that it's just about over now  
Everything is about to change  
Everything is a brand new number, darling  
Everything is a brand new game  
And it's funny I could even call you that  
After all the pain we've been through  
Ah, but time is the master of healing  
Love is the master of everything that we do  
  
There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again

We weren't meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day  
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings  
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind  
  
I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness  
Not a window around  
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone  
Then again each of us knows, in a night of unbearable sadness  
Still a light can be found  
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come  
  
I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic  
Oh the magic of love  
They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain  
Then again each of us knows, when a heart has been broken it's tragic  
Oh the magic of love  
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again  
  
All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing  
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear  
  
There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind  
We weren't meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day  
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings

Old Train, each time you pass  
You're older than the last  
And it seems I'm too old for running  
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails  
They cry with every mile  
And I think I'll stay awhile  
  
Old Train, I grow weary at the miles  
And I miss the freedom that was mine  
Old Train, just to think about those times

Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that it's Engine Number 49  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke rising 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts set the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes whoo oo oo oo  
Hey Jim, you better get the rig whoo oo oo oo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
  
And they'll all want a lift to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause lots of them been traveling for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadel phi a  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
All Aboard! All Aboard!  
  
Let her rip, let her rip, Mr. Engineer  
Gotta go, gotta go far away from here  
While the man at the fire, shovels in the coals  
Stick your head out the cab and watch the drivers roll  
See the towns and the roads go a whizzing by  
Fare-the-well Laramie and Rocky Mountain High  
Yes sirree, here we are, going all the way  
Mustn't quit till we hit Califor ni a

and pushed it a mile  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana  
Then my Daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction  
I asked my Daddy where are we goin', he said we'll just follow  
Our nose, so I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
I met a girl in a truck cafe, fell in love almost right away  
Then the Mercury was ready to go and I had to leave her

Go home said the man in the moon go home  
  
Because it's gettin' sorta late and I'll soon turn out my light

John Denver,On The Wings Of A Dream,/j/john+denver/on+the+wings+of+a+dream_20073689.html,"Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder  
After all has been said and is done for  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone  
  
Is this life just a path  
To the place that we all have come from  
Does the heart know the way  
And if not can it ever be found  
In a smile or a tear  
Or a prayer or a sigh or a song  
  
And if so I sing for my father  
And in truth you must know I would rather  
He were here by my side  
We could fly on the wings of a dream  
To a place where the spirit could find us  
And joy and surrender would bind us  
We are one anyway  
Anyway we are more than we seem  
  
There are those who will lead us  
Protect us each step of the way  
From beginning to end  
For each moment forever each day  
Such a gift has been given  
It can never be taken away  
  
Though the body in passing must leave us  
There is one who remains to receive us  
There are those in this life  
Who are friends from our heavenly home  
So I listen to the voices inside me  
For I know they are there just to guide me  
And my faith will proclaim it is so  
We are never alone  
  
From the life to the light  
From the dark of the night to the dawn  
He is so in my heart  
He is here he could never be gone  
Though the singer is silent  
There still is the truth of the song  
  
Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder

Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone

And make all hatred cease  
And give another name to living  
And we could call it peace  
And peace would be the road we walk  
Each step along the way  
And peace would be the way we work  
And peace the way we play  
And in all we see that's different  
And in all the things we know  
Peace would be the way we look  
And peace the way we grow  
There's a name for separation  
There's a name for first and last  
When it's all for us or nothing  
For me the name is past  
But there's still time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give a name to all the future  
And we could call it peace  
And if peace is what we pray for  
And peace is what we give  
Then peace will be the way we are  
And peace the way we live

His own way through the cold  
To come back again to all that youve been

A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade

Time that I take you home girl

Now we're doing it.  
Breathe, breathe.  
And sigh your sweet relief  
We've been holding it so long,  
The wait was killing me.  
Oh and we, are what we, have been waiting for.  
So baby, open your mind, while I close the door.

John Legend,Ordinary People,/j/john+legend/ordinary+people_10152518.html,"Girl, I'm in love with you  
This ain't the honeymoon  
Passed the infatuation phase  
Right in the thick of love  
At times we get sick of love  
Seems like we argue everyday  
  
I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes  
And we both still got room left to grow  
And though love sometimes hurts  
I still put you first  
And we'll make this thing work but I think maybe we should take it slow  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
  
This ain't a movie love  
No fairytale conclusion y'all  
It gets more confusing everyday  
Sometimes it's heaven sent  
Then we head back to hell again  
We kiss then we make up on the way  
  
I hang up, you call  
We rise and we fall  
And we feel like just walking away  
As our love advances we take second chances  
Though it's not a fantasy I still want you to stay  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
  
Take it slow  
Maybe we'll live and learn  
Maybe we'll crash and burn  
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave  
maybe you'll return  
Maybe another fight  
Maybe we won't survive  
But maybe we'll grow  
We never know Maybe you and I

All this trouble in this here town  
All this shit going down  
When will they focus, on this?  
Streets ride up with the TV crews  
Look ma, we on the news  
But they didn't notice, before this  
They float above the city lights  
Forget the truth, inhale the lies  
Just enjoy the show  
They see us reaching for the sky  
Just in order to survive  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Maybe we should go  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Penthouse floor  
  
[Verse 2: John Legend]  
All that bubbly, all that wine  
Oh man, look at the times  
Didn't they notice, notice?  
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be  
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this  
Once you're above the city lights  
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own  
The holding on is made for us  
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]  
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh  
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?  
Just us, who dis? Just playin'  
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era  
I'm in the penthouse, baby  
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs  
Held back, I had to grab crab legs  
And then there were only but a few  
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view  
What a dress, what a song  
What a beautiful time  
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line  
They never been in these rooms  
Never stayed with these folks  
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes  
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover  
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another  
He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""  
Then he pushed me off the top and said ""Jump, nigga, jump!""  
  
[Bridge: John Legend]  
Oh, don't bring me down, I need a room in the clouds  
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate  
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss  
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Those penthouse doors  
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)

Til we can rise some more

Girl you've been so good to me but I know  
I'm no good for you  
You should run while you can  
Find yourself a better man  
'Cause I'm known for brief romance  
And breakin hearts across the land  
  
Yes I've been known to have a few temptations  
Out there on the road  
And let's say hypothetically I've slipped and  
Took a couple home  
Girl I know that's not fair  
You need someone who'll be there  
So just get away before it's too late  
And you're pain is too much to bear

You know all you need to know

That heaven sent an angel down  
And then she turned my life around

Will we do right by you? Will we you have what you require  
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire?

I realize as I lay down to sleep, we haven't spoke in weeks  
So many things that I'd like to know...  
Come have a talk with me  
I need a sign, something I can see  
Why all the mystery?  
I try not to fall for make-believe, but what is reality?  
  
Where do we go, what do we know?  
Life has to have a meaning  
Show me the light, show me the way  
Show that you're listening  
Show me, that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watchin over me  
  
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you for all you've given me  
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me,  
I can't stop questioning  
Oh God of love, peace, and mercy, why so much suffering?  
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me  
Wonder if you're listening...  
  
When people go, why do they go?  
Why don't you choose me?  
But someday I'll know that I'm gonna go  
I hope you're waiting for me  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show nme that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watching over me  
Oh...  
  
Show me... Oh... Oh... Show me...  
  
Maybe we'll talk some other night  
Right now I'll take it easy  
Won't spend my time waiting to die  
Enjoy the life I'm living  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me  
Hopefully, just above me, heaven's watching over me  
Oh...  
  
Show me that you love me  
Show me that you walk with me

She see the glasses, so obvious  
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here  
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there  
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night  
She run her mouth, but can't eat right  
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white  
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white  
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us  
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,  
We all know that cocaine killed Abel  
From the scholar letters devour this  
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold  
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul  
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know  
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy  
  
I'm here with open arms and I got her  
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me  
Here is where her heart  
I'm here and I won't go without her  
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me  
Here is where her heart  
  
I beg for mercy today  
They won't take me away  
Take me away from you  
Don't know what I would do  
Don't let us die in vain  
Don't let them see our pain  
Wash these demons away  
Wash these demons away  
  
You are all unwelcome to Sin City  
Yet the population still increases its density  
And that increases its intensity  
Which increases the propensity  
To complicate your simplicity  
No matter your ethnicity  
All for the sake of publicity, in this city  
  
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots  
Use a house as a stash spot  
Lexus coupe with the rag-top  
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot  
I used to run with the have-nots  
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots  
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot  
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot  
We broke all the commandments  
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched  
Come spend a day in my Hamlet  
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis  
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis  
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch  
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it  
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices  
But this life'll take a toll on ya  
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices  
I know who Christ is  
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous  
By the age ten, we were caged in  
Now they raise men in the state pen  
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins  
God bless the city, amen  
  
I'm here with open arms and I got her  
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me  
Here is where her heart  
I'm here and I won't go without her  
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me  
  
And now I'm one of the residents  
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence  
And all the fuckin' debauchery  
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me  
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like  
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight  
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right  
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite  
But I am willing to share tonight  
In the city that is as unfair as life

I had a dream like dr. King  
I had a song I had to sing

The beat is way too loud

When I put you in my arm  
Feel it all through me  
When you promise me nothing  
You give me everything I need

We kiss like lovers

And even though it's dangerous  
It's temporarily painless  
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight

You need somebody too

Don't even know what your name is  
When I taste your skin

I just wanna bring your body  
Wanna push you in my place

You don't even have to stay  
Oh but I don't think you wanna leave

Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce  
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford  
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog  
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss  
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us  
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush  
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no  
Plus another twenty in a tuck  
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist  
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch  
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens  
Still in the game, uniform all linen

Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

Something I'd like to see if it's alright  
  
Life, go easy on me  
Love, don't pass me by  
  
Spending my time, making? A chime? And I'll throw away the rest  
Looking for ways to?...? And ease my mind  
Something I need, something I plea for, something I have to say  
Something to keep me safe when I'm away  
  
One way for me, one way for you, one way for all of us  
To get back home, do whatever we want to do  
Nothing to tell you, nothing to show, nothing that you don't know  
Something to play, something to say for now

Where she left you in an empty state of mind  
Waiting not for her but for relief from passing time  
And a young friend talking softly  
As the mist keep tumbling down  
But the woman waiting for him near  
Stayed and told you of the peace that could be found  
And a fallen heart was woken  
In your tired waiting time  
And you thought you might begin again  
From all the ashes of your mind  
And though he used no poetry  
His words are weaving songs  
And the peace they were recalling  
Were good roads that you might have walked along  
And the skies you saw were all the same  
Although his words were not your own  
But the words and images you've spoken  
Are the ashes from a peace you'd never known

Ain't going to see you for quite some time  
I'm fading away in the morning sun  
Maybe behind it I'll find someone  
Baby, why do you sneak into my mind?  
Why do you haunt me all the time?  
Why don't you go and leave me be?  
Why don't you go and leave me free?  
This time, stop me if you think you can  
Oh, we had a love that lived and died  
When it was over there was no one to cry  
So now that it's gone without one tear  
Reckon it's time that I was not here  
Been flitting around your scene too long  
Reckon it's time I was travelling on  
Oh baby, if you don't want me to go  
Why are you whispering my name so low

John McDermott,Farewell To Pripchat,/j/john+mcdermott/farewell+to+pripchat_20201208.html,"It was a Friday in April 1986,  
The day that nightmare begun,  
When the dust it fell down on our buildings and streets,  
And entered our buildings at noon,  
Touched the grass and trees, bicycyles, cars  
Beds, books and picture frames too,  
We stood around helpless, confused,  
Nobody knew what to do.  
At two o'clock on Sunday the buses arrived,  
A fleet of a thousand or more,  
We were ordered to be on our way,  
Not knowing what lay in store,  
Some of our citizens fled in dismay,  
And looked for a good place to hide,  
When four o'clock came and the last bus pulled out,  
T'was the day that our lively town died.  
[Chorus:]  
And the shirts, sheets and hankerchiefs cracks in the wind,  
On the window ledge the withering plants,  
And the Ladas and Volgas are parked by the door,  
And the bikes in its usual stance.  
Our evergreen tree lies withered and drooped,  
They've poisoned our fertile land,  
The streets speak a deafening silence,  
Nothing stirs but the sand.  
A visit back home is so eerie today,  
A modern Pompei in view,  
To see all the old shops ond the Forest Hotel,  
And the Promyet cinema too.  
The momentos we gathered all left behind,  
Our photos and letters and cards,  
The toys of our children untouchable now,  
Toy Soldiers left standing on guard.  
So fare thee well Pripchat, my home and my soul,  
Your sorrow can know no relief.  
A terrifying glimpse of the future you show,  
Your children all scattered like geese,  
The clothes lines still sways but the owners long gone.  
As the nomadic era returns,  
The questions in black and white blurred into grey,  
The answer is too easy to learn.

Then maybe at the closing of your day  
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh  
  
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay  
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream  
The women in the meadow making hay  
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin  
  
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play  
For the breezes blowing o'er the seas from Ireland  
Are perfumed by the heather as they bloom  
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties  
  
Speak a language that the strangers do not know  
For the stranger came and tried to teach us their way  
They scorned us just for being what we are  
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams  
  
Or light a penny candle from a star  
And if there's going to be a life hereafter  
And somehow I am sure there's going to be  
I will ask my god to let me make my heaven

I see by your gravestone you were only 19  
When you joined the great fall-in in 1916  
I hope you died well and I hope you died clean  
Or young willie mcbride was it slow and obscene.

Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down  
Did the band play the last post and chorus  
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest  
  
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind  
In some faithful heart is your memory enshrined  
Although you died back in 1916  
In that faithful heart are you forever 19  
Or are you a stranger without even a name  
Enclosed then forever behind a glass frame  
In an old photograph torn, battered and stained  
And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame.

And look how the sun shines from under the clouds  
There's no gas, no barbwire, there's no guns firing now  
But here in this graveyard it's still no man's land  
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand  
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man  
To a whole generation that were butchered and damned.

Well the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain  
The killing and the dying were all done in vain

To be back where dark mourne sweeps down to the sea

With beautiful shapes nature never designed  
And lovely complexions, all roses and 'cream

And leisure time to sit a while

That sorely has my heart beguiled  
Her rosey cheeks and ruby lips  
I own, she has my heart enthralled

There's a form at the casement the form of her true love

Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death.  
Death comes in a blinding flash of hellish heat that leaves a smear of ash  
And the sun has come to earth.

Twisted sightless wrecks of men go crawling on their knees and cry in pain

You're nothing more than just a drifter  
As you walk down your road  
Not exactly the picture  
You thought you'd be sending home  
All these places mean nothing  
It's the people we count on  
Here without a purpose  
Gone without a song  
  
Yesterday seemed so sudden  
Today seems to have no end  
So you button up the buttons  
Say goodbye to what has been  
Those black and white pictures  
That file through your veins  
That's the trouble with the future  
It always stays the same  
And your pride's been shaken  
And those people you count on  
Here without a purpose  
And gone without a song  
Without a song  
  
In the uncertainty of a new day  
Opportunity may howl  
You hear the voice in a new way  
In the past you didn't know how  
You're old enough to know the difference  
Between and enemy and a friend  
With the eyes of knowledge upon you  
You're able to stand up again  
Life is always in motion  
And there's new people to count on  
Here you may find a purpose  
And sing a brand new song

And your adolescent dreams are gone

And you don't know where your energy's gone wrong  
It's just your soul feelin' a little downhearted  
Sometimes life is too ridiculous to live  
You count your friends all on one finger  
I know it sounds crazy just the way that we live  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And that's as good as it can get for us  
And there ain't no reason to stop tryin'  
  
When this cardboard town can no longer amuse you  
You see through everything and nothin' seems worthwhile  
And hypocrite used to be such a big word to you  
And it don't seem to mean anything to you now  
Just try to live each and every precious moment  
Don't be discouraged by the future forget the past  
That's old advise but it'll be good to you  
I know there's a balance see it when I swing past

You wear a size seven and a half shoe  
You got this Rolex watch that I suspect you cobbed  
From that doctor who said he loved you

Like a bird who never touched the ground  
And if you did you would surely die without making a sound

And our summer was full of life  
We're gonna send them a postcard, and show 'em what it's like to be alive

There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same  
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream  
But farewell Angelina, the sky's changing colors, and I must leave  
  
The jacks and the queens they have forsake the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard  
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while  
  
See the cross-eyed pirate sit perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun  
And the corporals and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast  
But farewell Angelina, the sky is trembling, and I must leave fast  
  
King Kong little elves in the rooftops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos while the hero's clean hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over, and I must be gone  
  
The camouflaged parrot, he flutters from fear  
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears  
What can not be imitated perfect must die  
Farewell Angelina, the sky's flooding over, and I must go where it is dry

At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks

If I had to choose  
I could never really trust  
Any man wearing those funny French shoes  
  
Funny French shoes

No man should be wearin'  
Those funny French shoes  
They look good on a woman's foot  
I must say that they do  
But no guy should be wearin'  
Those funny French shoes  
  
Get some socks on, man!

Ain't no angel with a harp come singin'

Who knows what the masters might do  
They got their big deals goin' on, goin' on  
Got nothing to do with me and you  
  
If I could I'd get us a big suite  
Overlooking the park  
Only promise I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I don't need to see the whole thing go down  
I don't need to see another lonely man  
I don't need to see a woman crying for the savior  
Holding on to some moneyman's hand  
  
Who can I call to make my reservations  
Forever thrown in the dark  
The only promises I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I don't believe in the authorities  
They ain't gonna take care of me and you  
I don't have all the strength that I need  
To love the way that I want to

He's not satisfied not at all  
Feels like that he's being used  
His self respect starts to fall  
His frustration  
Running very very high he takes it out  
On the ones he loves, because it's safe  
And who they gonna tell  
And he hates that cold-bloodedness  
That runs inside  
  
Oh yes  
It's hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
Hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
  
Sister,  
She's got a lot of pride  
You can see it when she walks into the room  
But she's young  
And she's unaware  
Of what a brutal world can do to you  
So she loves a man  
He lies like a dog  
Tears her little world all apart  
So the walls go up  
For the rest of her days  
And there ain't no man can touch this  
Girls heart  
  
Oh yes.  
It's hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
Hard times, for an honest man  
Very, very hard times  
  
So we walk  
From the front porch to the back yard  
Just to laugh and say hello and  
Say goodbye  
But some days are hard, like a  
Soldier's steel-toed boots  
And the rent we pay to stay here  
Gets high  
  
Oh yes.

Very, very hard times

Takin' ahold of Angelina's hair and her halo  
Motors runnin' muffling the sound  
Of street talk, a big deal's goin' down

And a ring and a watch to hock for a sweet ride  
A one way ticket hidden in his shoe  
These last few hours  
He says he'll spend with you  
He's leavin' home without a trace  
No forwarding address he'll never have to face another...

And the corner boys are hangin' 'round  
Runnin' in and out of doorways

Seen the ashes down below  
I had breakfast with the wise man  
He told me what he thought I should know  
And I've been to bed with Jezebel  
And I found the well as deep  
And I'd trade in my ambitions  
For a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I've seen the heart of darkness  
Read the writing on the wall  
And the voice out in the desert  
Was the voice out in the hall  
And once he called me Abel  
And once he called me Cain  
And for forty days and for forty nights  
I slept out in the rain  
  
Girl can you share your warm bed tonight  
I need to find a safe retreat  
Someplace where they can't see my eyes  
I need to find a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I rested in the devils arms  
I've chased the hounds of hell  
I played truth or dare with the angels  
And as I fall as I can tell  
That a heart of gold ain't no better  
Than a heart torn from the street  
And I'd trade in my heart of stone  
For a warmer place to sleep  
  
Girl can you share your warm bed tonight

When Jesus left Birmingham  
All the people went completely nuts  
They all busted out on a wild night  
Riding high on a golden calf  
When Jesus left Birmingham  
All the people had themselves a big long laugh  
  
Well my girl, she's a walker  
And she can talk herself out of any mess  
My girl, she don't pray  
But somehow she seems still to be blessed  
And when those crazy nights come callin'  
Man, she'll dance on the tables  
Like all of the rest  
When my girl left Birmingham  
She was doing what she thought was best  
  
It's all free on the inside  
I passed a very uncomfortable feeling last night  
Save us right now, we need you...  
To hell with all the lies and liars  
Recovery, recovery, I don't know about any recovery  
Inside, gotta get inside  
Inside  
  
I see myself with a rosary  
I'm in a garden and I'm talking to myself  
I ain't sayin' much worth repeating  
Just askin' for forgiveness and all of his best  
When those crazy nights come callin'  
Man, I'm just as human as I can be  
When Jesus left Birmingham

When Jesus left Birmingham  
He left it there for you and me

John Mellencamp,Without A Shot,/j/john+mellencamp/without+a+shot_20751536.html,"Put your guns out on the table  
Throw your bullets on the floor  
This weary old house can't take it anymore  
From the ovens in the kitchen  
To the chains out in the dirt  
Rope hanging in the bedroom  
That's some of our dirty work  
  
The distant sleeping shadows  
That lie out in the yard  
The wind that distorts the meanings  
Of who we really are  
Saluting of ourselves  
As we pass by our mirrors  
This show of phony adulation  
Just masquerades all our fears  
  
So we open up our eyes at midnight  
See the setting of the sun  
Foundation is crumbling  
The inner structure's gone  
Used up by corruption  
And the passage of time  
We hope we've got some fight left  
Cause our children  
Our children are dying  
  
So we think that forgiveness  
Is a God given right  
And equality for all  
Is just a waste of our time  
With our nickel plated Jesus  
Chained around are necks  
Handing out verses of scripture  
Like we wrote it down ourselves  
  
Respect that we once had  
Went up the water spout  
Tried to keep it secret  
But the secret was found out  
Got to thinking high and mighty  
Like everything was a lock  
Some now say this house  
Can be taken without a shot  
  
So the hole gets dug deeper  
With every wedding bell  
And we sell each other down the road  
Until there's nothing left to sell  
And slowly but surely  
We disappear without a trace  
We point our fingers at each other  
And say what the hell happened to this place  
Without a shot  
Without a shot  
Without a shot

And then they call me up and say hey come over

Women seem to love houses  
I've bought a couple for one or two  
Women seem to think all men are louses  
And I guess I think so too  
Women seem so much smarter  
Than your average Joe  
Women seem to be a little more intuitive  
And when they lie nobody knows  
  
Well women seem to know how to keep a secret  
They don't blabbermouth just for show  
Fifty percent of their charm is illusion  
And that is a good thing to know

John Prine,Jesus The Missing Years,/j/john+prine/jesus+the+missing+years_20074762.html,"Jesus, the missing years  
  
It was raining. It was cold  
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old  
So he packed his bags and he headed out  
To find out what the world's about  
He went to France. He went to Spain  
He found love. He found pain.  
He found stores so he started to shop  
But he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop  
Kids in trouble with the cops  
From Israel didn't have no home  
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome  
It was there he met his Irish bride  
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome...  
Italy that is  
Music publishers, book binders, Bible belters, Money Changers,  
Spoon Benders and lots of pretty Italian chicks.  
  
[Chorus]  
Charley bought some popcorn  
Billy bought a car  
Someone almost bought the farm  
But they didn't go that far  
Things shut down at midnight  
At least around here they do  
Cause we all reside down the block  
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.  
  
Wine was flowing so were beers  
So Jesus found his missing years  
So He went to a dance and said ""This don't move me""  
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie  
On his thirteenth birthday he saw ""Rebel without a Cause""  
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus  
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind  
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind  
You see him and the wife wasn't getting along  
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song  
Called ""The Dove of Love Fell Off the Perch""  
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church  
At least not back then anyhow  
Jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit  
So he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and  
A Coca-Cola and he swallowed it.  
He discovered the Beatles  
And he recorded with the Stones  
Once He even opened up a three-way package  
In Southern California for old George Jones  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The years went by like sweet little days  
With babies crying pork chops and beaujolais  
When he woke up he was seventeen  
The world was angry. The world was mean.  
Why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop  
All agreed that life stank. All the world smelled like poop  
Baby poop that is ..the worst kind  
So he grew his hair long and thew away his comb  
And headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom, Dad and home  
But when he got there the cupboard was bare  
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod  
He said ""Whatcha gonna be when you grow up?""  
Jesus said ""God""  
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?  
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood  
They're gonna kill me Mama. They don't like me Bud.  
So Jesus went to Heaven and he went there awful quick  
All them people killed him and he wasn't even sick  
So come and gather around me my contemporary peers  
And I'll tell you all the story of  
Jesus, the missing years  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We all reside down the block  
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.

John Prine,John Prine Christmas,/j/john+prine/john+prine+christmas_20074812.html,"Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""  
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

There was this Indian tribe  
They found two babies in the woods  
White babies  
One of them was named Elizabeth  
She was the fairer of the two  
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie  
Having never seen white girls before  
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes  
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth  
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway  
Became known forever as Lake Marie

And Man, they was ssssssssizzlin'  
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada  
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish

I never did believe anything I ever read in your magazine until just the other
night.  
  
When something happen to me that was so strange that I felt compelled to share
it with your readers.  
  
I'm a student at state-you.  
  
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. It was one year ago tonight that my room
mate ""stupendous dork"" and I were sittin' around the dorm poppin' a few
frosty's and burning some rope, and boning up for the speech therapy midterm
exam the next day, by reading back issues of your magazine out loud to each
other.  
  
I looked at ""stu"" and he looked at me and we both knew neither of us was going
to get a real good grade on that exam anyway. We hopped out of the dorm and
went across the street to herbie's tumble inn.  
  
Right across from the dorm there, we came through the swinging doors and I
couldn't believe my eyes, there they were, sitting at the bar, these two
luscious babes, and they were siamese twins  
  
I looked at ""stu"" and he looked at me and we looked at them and they looked at
us and then one of the twins said ""won't you join us? "" and I just laughed and
we went and sat down at the bar.  
  
Turns out, one if the ladies was a speech therapy major and her sister said
she had some rope in her purse there, and a big light bulb went off in my head
and I said ""what the heck, why don't we all go back to the dorm? ""  
  
Came out of the swingin' doors at herbie's and couldn't get across the street.  
  
There was these 30 bikers with jackets that said ""harley aristocrats"" on the
back. There was an aerobic dance class and there was the commanding officer of
the campus rotc pushing a nautilus machine right down the double yellow line.
I said ""what the heck, why don't we all go back to the dorm? ""  
  
The last thing I remember is one of the twins screaming, ""hey general put your
big heat seeking missile in my love silo!""  
  
I got my degree in spite of failing speech therapy that quarter. Last night
for the first time in a year, my room mate stupendous dork went back to
herbie's to toast our commencement. Came thru the swingin' doors and there
they were at the bar, the same two siamese twins and I said ""oh no"" and I went
and sat down a table.  
  
The twins came over to the table and the one that was a speech therapy major
looked my right in the eye and said: ""excuse me you probably don't remember
us.""

Way back in 1953.

Till they took him to russia cause they could I suppose  
They dressed him up in a spacesuit and it started to snow  
Shot him off in a rocket where no man would go

No hammer or sickle you'll be on your own.

But he found great difficulty trying to open the can  
One day he slipped on a banana peel and the ship lost control

A half a block off of red square  
In a karaoke bar having a few drinks with some of his friends  
There was the dog that flew sputnik  
And a blind red-headed, one legged parrot  
Who had done some minor research for dow chemical  
They were drinking american vodka  
Imported all the way from paducah, kentucky  
And reportedly had their arms around each other's  
Shoulders singing.

And rock that old baby to sleep  
  
She loves the sound of the rain  
But you know she's still afraid of the thunder  
She keeps a head full of hope  
And a heart that's so full of wonder  
She may look like a woman  
But she's still some daddys little girl  
And I think that she may be  
The oldest baby in the world  
Yes, I think that she may be  
The oldest baby in the world

To the Count of Monte Cristo  
Nothing can stop  
Nothing can stop  
Nothing can stop  
The sins of Memphisto  
  
Sally used to play with her hula hoops  
Now she tells her problems to therapy groups  
Grampa's on the front lawn staring at a rake  
Wondering if his marriage was a terrible mistake  
I'm sitting on the front steps drinking orange crush  
Wondering if it's possible if I could still blush  
Uh huh, oh yeah  
  
A boy on a bike with corduroy slacks  
Sleeps in the river by the railroad tracks  
He waits for the whistle on the train to scream  
So he can close his eyes and begin to dream  
Uh huh, oh yeah  
  
The hands on his watch spin slowly around  
With his mind on a bus that goes all over town  
Looking at the babies and the factories  
And listening to the music of Mister Squeeze  
As if by magic or remote control  
He finds a piece of a puzzle  
That he missed in his soul  
Uh huh, oh yeah  
  
Adam and Eve and Lucy and Ricky  
Bit the big apple and got a little sticky  
Esmeralda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame  
They humped each other like they had no shame  
They paused as they posed for a Polaroid photo  
She whispered in his ear ""Exactly Odo Quasimoto""

Kept undercover, like some bad dream

They run like water, through a mountain stream  
In a cold and gray town, a nurse say's ""Lay down""  
'This ain't no playground, and this ain't home'  
Someone's children, out having children  
In a gray stone building, all alone  
On somewhere else bound, Smokey Mountain Greyhound  
She bows her head down, hummin' lullabies  
'Your daddy never, meant to hurt you ever'  
'He just don't live here, but you've got his eyes'

John Waite,White Lightening,/j/john+waite/white+lightening_20074863.html,"When I was young  
They took me to the dentist  
I had a toothache  
But that's okay  
  
They gave me some time  
And that night in my bedroom  
I worked it loose  
Like I used to do  
  
One little boy in a dentist's chair  
Heard a hundred angels  
flying past him  
What a gas  
  
Sitting there  
The same little boy with a few more years  
Took a sniff of this  
A taste of that  
  
What a drag  
Nothing there  
And then one day he saw you walk  
And heard you didn't talk  
  
Saw the writing on the wall  
It didn't thunder anymore  
White lightening it's got nothing on you  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds  
  
Oh it didn't shine like you Lord  
White lightening way out in the blue  
With a million angels singin'  
Oh it didn't sound like you Lord  
  
Come on to tell when I tell you to breathe in  
I will take out everything while you're sleeping  
Always refusing the heavenly music  
When you awake it will have a new meaning

I'd love to  
One of the greatest guitar players as well as song writers and singers in
Memphis  
Appreciate a little help on guitar, alright. Thank you Carl  
  
Well,my daddy left home when I was three  
And he didn't leave much to ma and me  
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze  
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid  
But the meanest thing that he ever did  
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue  
  
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke  
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk  
It seems I had to fight my whole life through  
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red  
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,  
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue  
  
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean  
My fist got hard and my wits got keen  
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame  
But I made a vow to the moon and stars  
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars  
And kill that man who gave me that awful name  
  
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July  
And I just hit town and my throat was dry  
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew  
At an old saloon on a street of mud  
There at a table, dealing stud  
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue  
  
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad  
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had  
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye  
He was big and bent and gray and old  
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold  
And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do  
Now you're gonna die""  
  
(yeah, that's what I told him)  
  
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes  
And he went down, but to my surprise  
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear  
But I busted a chair right across his teeth  
And we crashed through the wall and into the street  
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  
  
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men  
But I really can't remember when  
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile  
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss  
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first  
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile  
  
And he said, ""Son, this world is rough  
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough  
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along  
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye  
I knew you'd have to get tough or die  
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""  
  
He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight  
And I know you hate me, and you got the right  
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do  
But ya ought to thank me, before I die  
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye  
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""  
  
Well what could I do? What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun  
And I called him my paw, and he called me his son  
And I came away with a different point of view  
And I think about him, now and then  
Every time I try and every time I win  
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..  
Bill or George! Any-damn-thing but Sue!  
  
Alright, thank you very much

Do I have a letter from home  
  
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come  
Then smilingly shook his gray head  
The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him  
And these are the words that he said  
  
No letter from home, no letter from home  
There's never a letter from home  
No message from mother or none of the others  
There's never a letter from home  
  
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town  
No more of those plains will he roam  
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him  
And said, ""Son here's your letter from home""  
  
""If only I had just a little more time  
To read it"", the young cowpoke said  
""I can't take it with me and I must go on""

No time for the letter from home

Of love that's always been.

Who are now gone with the wind.

Then keep coming back around again  
Nothing's changed except the name,  
Their love burned just like mine.

How it would be for me and you  
They'd wish for love like yours  
And they would wish for love like mine.

And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip

Would wither and would die  
And love is all that will remain  
And grow from all these seeds  
  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.

Johnny Cash,Gentle On My Mind,/j/johnny+cash/gentle+on+my+mind+feat+glen+campbell_20206851.html,"Well, it's knowin' that your door is always open  
And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up  
Stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or somethin' that somebody said 'cause  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards  
And the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
I dip my cup of soup  
From some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  
My beard a roughenin' coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're wavin' from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

I could see that he was nearly dead  
I knelt down beside him and I listened  
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said  
  
He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco  
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done  
I was trying to get back to Louisiana  
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please won't you mister  
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes  
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him  
And don't forget to give my love to Rose  
  
Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me  
Tell my boy to help his mom at home  
Tell my Rose to try to find another  
For it ain't right that she should live alone  
  
Mister here's a bag with all my money  
It won't last them long the way it goes  
God bless you for finding me this morning  
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Anyways, this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley  
Um, hope we do your song justice Glen, we're going to do our best  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom  
A house of worship in this den of sin  
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom  
But he saved the souls of many lost men  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock  
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom  
But the door to the House of God is never locked  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
There are men here that don't ever worship  
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray  
But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel  
And I thank the Lord for helpin' me each day  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
It has a touch of God's hand on ever stone  
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness  
And it's givin' me the strength to carry on  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free

Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night

And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun  
He won't say how many tried and died  
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run  
  
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train  
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up  
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again  
  
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried  
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died  
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky  
  
Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did  
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid  
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid  
  
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign  
You won't find him there for business every day at nine  
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time  
  
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place  
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face  
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace  
  
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar  
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there  
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far  
  
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun  
Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head  
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run

Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it  
Salty so that none would use it""

It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision  
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning  
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions  
Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops  
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly  
And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people  
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered  
Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""  
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies  
In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities  
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils  
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful  
And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair  
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people  
Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder  
Grew the west that once was ours

To wash her hands  
She only brings him out to show her friends  
I want to free him  
  
Secrets and sharing soda  
That's how our time began  
Love is a story told to a friend  
It's second hand  
But I'll listen to his questions  
I'll give my answers when they're found  
He says she keeps him guessing  
I know she keeps him down  
She speaks in sorry sentences  
Miraculous repentances  
I don't believe her  
Tomorrow he will come to me  
And he'll speak his sorrows endlessly and he'll ask me why  
Why can't I leave her?  
  
He comes for conversation  
I comfort him sometimes  
Comfort and consultation  
He knows that's what he'll find  
He knows that's what, he'll find

Joni Mitchell,Coyote,/j/joni+mitchell/coyote_20075418.html,"No regrets Coyote  
We just come from such different sets of circumstance  
I'm up all night in the studios  
And you're up early on your ranch  
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail  
While the sun is ascending  
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel  
  
There's no comprehending  
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes  
And the lips you can get  
And still feel so alone  
And still feel related  
Like stations in some relay  
You're not a hit and run driver, no, no  
Racing away  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway  
  
We saw a farmhouse burning down  
In the middle of nowhere  
In the middle of the night  
And we rolled right past that tragedy  
Till we turned into some road house lights  
Where a local band was playing  
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor  
And the next thing I know  
That Coyote's at my door  
He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""  
  
He drags me out on the dance floor  
And we're dancing close and slow  
Now he's got a woman at home  
He's got another woman down the hall  
He seems to want me anyway  
Why'd you have to get so drunk  
And lead me on that way  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway  
  
I looked a Coyote right in the face  
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town  
He went running through the whisker wheat  
Chasing some prize down  
And a hawk was playing with him  
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes  
He had those same eyes - just like yours  
Under your dark glasses  
Privately probing the public rooms  
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors  
Where the players lick their wounds  
And take their temporary lovers  
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play  
  
No regrets, Coyote  
I just get off up aways  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway  
  
Coyote's in the coffee shop  
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs  
He picks up my scent on his fingers  
While he's watching the waitresses' legs  
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy  
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides  
And the air conditioned cubicles  
And the carbon ribbon rides  
Are spelling it out so clear  
Either he's going to have to stand and fight  
Or take off out of here  
I tried to run away myself  
To run away and wrestle with my ego  
And with this flame  
You put here in this Eskimo  
In this hitcher  
In this prisoner  
Of the fine white lines  
Of the white lines on the free, free way

Joni Mitchell,Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,/j/joni+mitchell/don+juans+reckless+daughter_20075321.html,"I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter  
I came out two days on your tail  
Those two bald-headed days in November  
Before the first snowflakes sail  
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery  
A split tongue spirit talks  
Noble as a nickel chief  
Striking up an old juke box  
And he says:  
""Snakes along the railroad tracks.""  
He says, ""Eagles in jet trails""  
He says, ""Coils around feathers and talons on scales  
Gravel under the belly plates""  
He says, ""Wind in the Wings""  
He says, ""Big bird dragging its tail in the dust  
Snake kite flying on a string.""  
  
I come from open prairie  
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!  
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas  
Reran on channel five  
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul  
I nearly broke down and cried  
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me  
He says, ""Your serpent cannot be denied.""  
Our serpents love the whisky bars  
They love the romance of the crime  
But didn't I see a neon sign  
Fester on your hotel blind  
And a country road come off the wall  
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar  
And put me at the top of your danger list  
Just for being so much like you are!  
  
You're a coward against the altitude  
You're a coward against the flesh  
Coward, caught between yes and no  
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!  
Reckless brazen in the play  
Of your changing traffic lights  
Coward, slinking down the hall  
to another restless night  
As we center behind the eight ball  
As we rock between the sheets  
As we siphon the colored language  
Off the farms and the streets  
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America  
the home of the brave and the free  
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards  
Of some duality  
Of restless multiplicity  
(Oh say can you see)  
  
Restless for streets and honky tonks  
Restless for home and routine  
Restless for country-safety-and her  
Restless for the likes of reckless me  
Restless sweeps like fire and rain  
Over virgin wilderness  
It prowls like hookers and thieves  
Through bolt locked tenements  
Behind my bolt locked door  
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me  
The serpent fighting for blind desire  
The eagle for clarity  
What strange prizes these battles bring  
These hectic joys-these weary blues  
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win  
Down and shaken when I think I lose  
There are rivets up here in this eagle  
There are box cars down there on your snake  
And we are twins of spirit  
No matter which route home we take  
Or what we forsake  
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity  
And we'll go down to the beads of guile  
There is danger and education  
In living out such a reckless life style  
I touched you on the central plains  
It was plane to train my twin  
It was just plane shadow to train shadow  
But to me it was skin to skin  
The spirit talks in spectrums  
He talks to mother earth to father sky  
Self indulgence to self denial  
Man to woman  
Scales to feathers  
You and I  
Eagles in the sky  
You and I  
Snakes in the grass  
You and I  
Crawl and fly  
You and I

Disco dancers greet him  
Plainclothes cops greet him  
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening  
Sophomore jive  
From victims of typewriters  
The band sounds like typewriters  
The big man he's not listening  
His eyes hold Edith  
His left hand holds his right  
What does that hand desire  
That he grips it so tight  
  
Edith in the ring  
The passed-over girls are conferring  
The man with the diamond ring is purring  
All claws for now withdrawn  
One by one they bring  
His renegade stories to her  
His crimes and his glories to her  
In challenge they look on  
Women he has wanted grow old too soon  
He tilts their tired faces  
Gently to the spoon  
  
Edith in his bed  
A plane in the rain is humming  
The wires in the walls are humming  
Some song-some mysterious song  
Bars in her head  
Beating frantic and snow blind  
Romantic and snow blind  
She says-his crime belongs  
Edith and the Kingpin  
Each with charm to sway  
Are staring eye to eye  
They dare not look away  
You know they dare not look away

I couldn't feel my hands or feet  
I shouldn't have come

For gleaming with Donald down her street  
She put blame on him  
And shame on me  
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap  
""Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts  
You know, happiness is the best face lift""  
  
I mean, after all, she introduced us  
Oh, but she regrets that now  
Shacked up downtown  
Making love without a license  
Same old sacred cow  
She said, ""Did you come home to disgrace us?""  
I said, ""Why is this joy not allowed?  
For God's sake, I'm middle-aged, Mama  
And time moves swift  
And you know happiness is the best face lift""  
  
Oh, love takes so much courage  
Love takes so much shit  
He said ""You've seen too many movies, Joni""  
She said ""Snap out of it!""  
Oh, the cold winds blew at our room with a view  
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit  
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed  
You know, Happiness is the best face lift  
  
We pushed the bed up to the window  
To see the Christmas lights  
On the east bank across the steaming river  
Between the bridges lit up Paris-like  
This river has run through both our lives  
Between these banks of our continuing delights  
Bless us, don't let us lose the drift  
You know, Happiness is the best face lift.

Maybe once or twice a year  
I think nothing would suit me better  
(Right now)  
Than some downtown atmosphere  
In the dance halls and the galleries  
Or betting in the OTB  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
The sun goes down in Jersey  
Rises over Little Italy,  
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up  
Swapping stories  
Sitting around in some all night zoo  
Watching it run like a movie  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
  
But now it's cloak and dagger  
Walk on eggshells and analyze  
Every particle of difference  
Gets like mountains in our eyes  
You say, ""You're unscrupulous!""  
You say, ""You're naive!""  
Synchronized--like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
  
Sometimes change comes at you  
Like a broadside accident  
There is chaos to the order  
Random things you can't prevent  
There could be trouble around the corner  
There could be beauty down the street  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
No nerves of steel  
No hearts of gold  
No blame for what we can and can't control

Joni Mitchell,Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,/j/joni+mitchell/goodbye+pork+pie+hat_20075422.html,"When Charlie speaks of Lester  
You know someone great has gone  
The sweetest swinging music man  
Had a Porkie Pig hat on  
A bright star  
In a dark age  
When the bandstands had a thousand ways  
Of refusing a black man admission  
Black musician  
In those days they put him in an  
Underdog position  
Cellars and chittlins'  
  
When Lester took him a wife  
Arm and arm went black and white  
And some saw red  
And drove them from their hotel bed  
Love is never easy  
It's short of the hope we have for happiness  
Bright and sweet  
Love is never easy street!  
Now we are black and white  
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night  
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town  
Or be hung in a tree  
That's unlikely!  
  
Tonight these crowds  
Are happy and loud  
Children are up dancing in the streets  
In the sticky middle of the night  
Summer serenade  
Of taxi horns and fun arcades  
Where right or wrong  
Under neon  
Every feeling goes on!  
For you and me  
The sidewalk is a history book  
And a circus  
Dangerous clowns  
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions  
They have been handed  
Day by day  
Generations on down  
  
We came up from the subway  
On the music midnight makes  
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone  
In taxi horns and brakes  
Now Charlie's down in Mexico  
With the healers  
So the sidewalk leads us with music  
To two little dancers  
Dancing outside a black bar  
There's a sign up on the awning  
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""  
And there's black babies dancing  
Tonight!

Into a stranger's warm, but  
Hard-up kitchen.  
She sees what must be done  
So she takes off her coat  
Rolls up her sleeves  
And starts pitchin' in.  
  
Hana has a special knack  
For getting people back on the right track  
'Cause she knows  
They all matter  
So she doesn't argue or flatter  
She doesn't fight the slights  
She takes it on the chin  
Like a champ  
  
Hana says when life's a drag  
Don't cave in  
Don't put up a white flag  
Raise up  
A white banner  
In this manner-  
Straighten your back  
Dig in your heals  
And get a good grip on your grief!  
  
Hana says, ""Don't get me wrong  
This is no simple Sunday song  
Where God or Jesus comes along  
And they save ya.""  
You've got to be braver than that  
You tackle the beast alone  
With all its tenacious teeth!  
Light the lamp.

I'm sitting in some cafe  
A defector from the petty wars  
That shell shocked love away  
  
There's comfort in melancholy  
When there's no need to explain  
It's just as natural as the weather  
In this moody sky today  
  
In our possessive coupling  
So much could not be expressed  
So now I'm returning to myself  
These things that you and I suppressed  
  
I see something of myself in everyone  
Just at this moment of the world  
As snow gathers like bolts of lace  
Waltzing on a ballroom girl  
  
You know it never has been easy  
Whether you do or you do not resign  
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities  
Or stick to some straighter line  
  
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock  
They're either going to thaw out or freeze  
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman  
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees  
  
I'm porous with travel fever  
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own  
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger  
Can set up trembling in my bones  
  
I know, no one's going to show me everything  
We all come and go unknown  
Each so deep and superficial  
Between the forceps and the stone  
  
Well I looked at the granite markers  
Those tribute to finality, to eternity  
And then I looked at myself here  
Chicken scratching for my immortality  
  
In the church they light the candles  
And the wax rolls down like tears  
There's the hope and the hopelessness  
I've witnessed thirty years  
  
We're only particles of change I know, I know  
Orbiting around the sun  
But how can I have that point of view  
When I'm always bound and tied to someone  
  
White flags of winter chimneys  
Waving truce against the moon  
In the mirrors of a modern bank  
From the window of a hotel room  
  
I'm traveling in some vehicle  
I'm sitting in some cafe  
A defector from the petty wars  
Until love sucks me back that way

How do you stop lovers from deceiving  
How do you stop the tide from coming in  
How do you stop the cold, cold wind

Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote ""I love you"" in my finest hand  
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand  
  
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California and talking to you  
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned  
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand  
  
Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green  
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream  
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can  
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

I can't go back there anymore  
You know my keys won't fit the door  
You know my thoughts don't fit the man

Ladies in gingham still blush  
While he sings them of wars and wine  
But I in my leather and lace  
I can never become that kind

Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon  
Beware of the power of moons

No there's no one to name as a traitor here  
The king's on the road  
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year-

Stepping stones or sinking sand  
  
Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime  
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor  
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine  
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her  
  
Oh, I think I understand  
Fear is like a wilderland  
Stepping stones and sinking sand  
  
Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again  
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind  
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane  
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time  
  
Oh, I think I understand  
Fear is like a wilderland  
Stepping stones or sinking sand

I'll try to keep myself open up to you  
It gets easier and easier to do  
Just like Jericho  
Let these walls come tumbling down now  
Let them fall right on the ground  
Let all these dogs go running free  
The wild and the gentle dogs  
Kenneled in me

Just like this train  
Shaking into town  
With the brakes complaining  
  
I used to count lovers like railroad cars  
I counted them on my side  
Lately I don't count on nothing  
I just let things slide  
  
The station master's shuffling cards  
Boxcars are banging in the yards  
Jealous Iovin'Il make you crazy  
If you can't find your goodness  
'Cause you lost your heart  
  
I went looking for a cause  
Or a strong cat without claws  
Or any reason to resume  
And I found this empty seat  
In this crowded waiting room  
(Everybody waiting)  
Old man sleeping on his bags  
Women with that teased up kind of hair  
Kids with the jitters in their legs  
And those wide, wide open stares  
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars  
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar  
Jealous lovin'lI make you crazy  
If you can't find your goodness  
'Cause you've lost your heart  
  
What are you going to do now  
You've got no one  
To give your love too  
  
Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind  
I've got this fold up sink  
And these rocks and these cactus going by  
And a bottle of German wine to drink  
Settle down into the clickety cIack  
With the clouds and the stars to read  
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have  
Watching your hairline recede  
(My vain darling)  
Watching your hair and clouds and stars  
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car  
This jealous lovin's bound to make me  
Crazy  
I can't find my goodness  
I lost my heart  
Oh sour grapes  
Because I lost my heart

Off a rattlesnake

They don't stand a chance  
First, you unfold them  
Then you pigeon-hole 'em

Good natured self-control

You're so cold, so cold

Why do you keep on trying to  
Make a man of me  
Couldn't you just love me  
Like you love cocaine  
Cocaine head games  
  
Cross my heart I swear  
I'm not trying to trick you  
No tricks  
Ladies' man  
It's just a straight ahead feeling  
I have for you  
Nothing slick  
Ladies' man  
I guess you learn to refuse  
What you think you can't handle  
You're acting like a vandal  
Wrecking the dream  
At the first bad scene

Sewing lace on widows' weeds  
And filigree on leaf and vine

And her coat's a secondhand one  
Trimmed with antique luxury  
She is a lady of the canyon  
  
Annie sits you down to eat  
She always makes you welcome in  
Cats and babies 'round her feet  
And all are fat and none are thin  
None are thin and all are fat  
She may bake some brownies today  
Saying, you are welcome back  
She is another canyon lady  
  
Estrella circus girl  
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls  
Songs like tiny hammers hurled  
At beveled mirrors in empty halls  
Empty halls and beveled mirrors  
Sailing seas and climbing banyans  
Come out for a visit here  
To be a lady of the canyon  
  
Trina takes her paints and her threads  
And she weaves a pattern all her own  
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads  
And she gathers flowers for her home  
For her home she gathers flowers  
And Estrella, dear companion  
Colors up the sunshine hours  
Pouring music down the canyon-  
Coloring the sunshine hours  
They are the ladies of the canyon

Lay down the reeking ore!  
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?  
Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore  
Every time you skin her all things weep  
Your money mocks us  
Restitution, what good can it do?  
Kenneled in metered boxes  
Red dogs in debt to you

Fighting among ourselves  
All we can say with one whole heart  
Is we won't sell,  
No we'll never sell  
We want the land!  
The lonely coyote calls  
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer  
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls  
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years  
You think we're sleeping--but  
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars  
We have seen the trampled rainbows  
In the smoke of cars

Standing on sacred land  
We never sold these Black Hills  
To the missile-heads,  
To the power plants  
We want the land!  
The bullet and the fence, broke Lakota  
The black coats and the booze, broke Lakota  
Courts that circumvent, choke Lakota  
Nothing left to lose  
Tell me grandfather  
You spoke the fur and feather tongues,  
Do you hear the whimpering waters  
When the tractors come?

That gets you tough  
Guru books-the Bible  
Only a reminder  
That you're just not good enough  
You need to believe in something  
Once I could in our love  
Black road  
Double yellow line  
Friends and kin  
Campers in the kitchen  
That's fine sometimes  
But I know my needs  
My sweet tumbleweed  
I need more quiet times  
By a river flowing  
You and me  
Deep kisses  
And the sun going down  
  
Maybe it's paranoia  
Maybe it's sensitivity  
Your friends protect you  
Scrutinize me  
I get so damn timid  
Not at all the spirit  
That's inside of me  
Oh baby I can't seem to make it  
With you socially  
There's this reef around me  
I'm looking way out at the ocean  
Love to see that green water in motion  
I'm going to get a boat  
And we can row it  
If you ever get the notion  
To be needed by me  
Fresh salmon frying  
And the tide rolling in  
  
I went to see a friend tonight  
'Was very late when I walked in  
My talking as it rambled  
Revealed suspicious reasoning  
The visit seemed to darken him  
I came in as bright  
As a neon light  
And I burned out  
Right there before him  
I told him these things  
I'm telling you now  
Watched them buckle up  
In his brow  
When you dig down deep  
You lose good sleep  
And it makes you  
Heavy company  
I will always love you  
Hands alike  
Magnet and iron  
The souls

Concealed behind their rosaries

The city grated through chrome-plate  
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon  
Through the tunnel tiled and turning  
Into daylight once again I am escaping  
Once again goodbye  
To symphonies and dirty trees  
With parks and plastic clothes  
The ghostly garden grows  
  
He asked me for a dollar more  
He cursed me to my face  
He hated everyone who paid to ride  
And share his common space  
I picked my bags up from the curb  
And stumbled to the door  
Another man reached out his hand  
Another hand reached out for more  
And I filled it full of silver  
And I left the fingers counting  
And the sky goes on forever  
Without meter maids and peace parades  
  
You feed it all your woes  
The ghostly garden grows

In a big blue moon  
There comes a night like this  
Like some surrealist  
Invented this fourth of July  
Night ride home  
  
Hula girls  
And caterpillar tractors in the sand  
The ukulele man  
The fireworks  
This 4th of July  
Night ride home  
  
I love the man beside me  
We love the open road  
No phones till Friday  
Far from the overkill  
Far from the overload  
  
Back at the bar  
The band tears down  
But out here in the headlight beams  
The silver power lines  
Gleam  
On this fourth of July  
Night ride home  
  
Round the curve  
And a big dark horse  
Red taillights on his hide  
Is keeping right alongside  
Rev for stride  
Fourth of July  
Night ride home

She's undercover from the dawns advance  
That girl is travel-drained  
And the neon mercury vapor stained  
Miami sky  
It's red as meat  
It's a cheap pink rose  
Otis in the driver's seat  
Watches the street lights fade away  
On louvered blocks in green sea air  
In fluorescent fossil yards  
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs  
Freckled hands are shuffling cards  
  
They've come for fun and sun  
While Muslims stick up Washington  
  
Otis empties out the trunk  
On the steps of that celebrated dump  
Sleazing by the sea  
Bow down to her royal travesty  
In her ballrooms heads of state  
In her bedrooms rented girls  
Always the grand parades of cellulite  
Jiggling to her golden pools  
Through flock and cupid colonnades  
They jiggle into surgery  
Hopefully beneath the blade  
They dream of golden beauty  
  
They've come for fun and sun  
While Muslims stick up Washington  
  
Marlena, white as stretcher sheet  
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony  
Like it's her opera box  
All those Pagliacci summer frocks  
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial  
All he gets are cartoons and reruns  
She taps her glass with an emery file  
Watching three rings in the sun  
The golden dive, the fatted flake  
And sizzle in the mink oil  
It's all a dream  
She has awake  
Checked into Miami Royal  
Where they've come for fun and sun  
While Muslims hold up Washington  
Dream on  
Dream on

He drank and womanized  
And I sat before his sanity  
I was holding back from crying  
He saw my complications  
And he mirrored me back simplified  
And we laughed how our perfection  
Would always be denied  
""Heart and humor and humility""  
He said ""Will lighten up your heavy load""  
I left him for the refuge of the roads  
  
I fell in with some drifters  
Cast upon a beach town  
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs  
And I wound up fixing dinner  
For them and Boston Jim  
I well up with affection  
Thinking back down the roads to then  
The nets were overflowing  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads  
  
There was spring along the ditches  
There were good times in the cities  
Oh, radiant happiness  
It was all so light and easy  
Till I started analyzing  
And I brought on my old ways  
A thunderhead of judgment was  
Gathering in my gaze  
And it made most people nervous  
They just didn't want to know  
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads  
  
I pulled off into a forest  
Crickets clicking in the ferns  
Like a wheel of fortune  
I heard my fate turn, turn turn  
And I went running down a white sand road  
I was running like a white-assed deer  
Running to lose the blues  
To the innocence in here  
These are the clouds of Michelangelo  
Muscular with gods and sungold  
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads  
  
In a highway service station  
Over the month of June  
Was a photograph of the earth  
Taken coming back from the moon  
And you couldn't see a city  
On that marbled bowling ball  
Or a forest or a highway  
Or me here least of all  
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms  
Or this baggage overload  
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads

Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint  
Mimicking tenderness she sees  
In sentimental movies  
A celluloid rider comes to town  
Cinematic lovers sway  
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns  
Take her breath away  
  
Out in the wind in crinolines  
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn  
Through stand-in boys and extra players  
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair  
She comes from a school of southern charm  
She likes to have things her way  
Any man in the world holding out his arm  
Would soon be made to pay  
  
Friends have told her not so proud  
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling ""not so loud""  
Lovers in anger ""Block of Ice""  
Harder and harder just to be nice  
Given in the night to dark dreams  
From the dark things she feels  
She covers her eyes in the X-rated scenes  
Running from the reels  
  
Beauty and madness to be praised  
'Cause it is not easy to be brave  
To walk around in so much need  
To carry the weight of all that greed  
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands  
Cast iron and frail  
With her impossibly gentle hands  
And her blood-red fingernails  
  
Out of the fire and still smoldering  
She says ""A woman must have everything""  
Shades of Scarlett Conquering  
She says ""A woman must have everything""

Have names they must call me

I came to the city  
And lived like old Crusoe  
On an island of noise  
In a cobblestone sea  
And the beaches were concrete  
And the stars paid a light bill  
And the blossoms hung false  
On their store window trees  
My dreams with the seagulls fly  
Out of reach out of cry  
  
Out of the city  
And down to the seaside  
To sun on my shoulders  
And wind in my hair  
But sandcastles crumble  
And hunger is human  
And humans are hungry  
For worlds they can't share  
My dreams with the seagulls fly  
Out of reach out of cry  
  
I call to a seagull  
Who dives to the waters  
And catches his silver-fine  
Dinner alone  
Crying where are the footprints  
That danced on these beaches  
And the hands that cast wishes  
That sunk like a stone  
My dreams with the seagulls fly  
Out of reach Out of cry

And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear  
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings  
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings  
You looked so grand wearing wings  
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly  
I heard you can! Can you fly  
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky  
  
I followed with the sideshows to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice  
  
I heard your bid once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Pack it in  
I heard you did! Pack it in  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win  
  
So lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news  
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine  
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime  
  
I've lost my fire overtime  
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime  
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired!  
Slowin' down  
And I envy you the valley that you've found  
'Cause I'm midway down the midway  
Slowin' down, down, down, down

With Negro affectations  
I was a hopeful in rooms like this  
When I was working cheap  
It's an old romance-the Boho dance  
It hasn't gone to sleep  
  
But even on the scuffle  
The cleaner's press was in my jeans  
And any eye for detail  
Caught a little lace along the seams  
  
And you were in the parking lot  
Subterranean by your own design  
The virtue of your style inscribed  
On your contempt for mine  
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace  
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory  
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance  
Have a fascination for me  
  
A camera pans the cocktail hour  
Behind a blind of potted palms  
And finds a lady in a Paris dress  
With runs in her nylons  
  
You read those books where luxury  
Comes as a guest to take a slave  
Books where artists in noble poverty  
Go like virgins to the grave  
Don't you get sensitive on me  
'Cause I know you're just too proud  
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now  
Even if good fortune allowed  
  
Like a priest with a pornographic watch  
Looking and longing on the sly  
Sure it's stricken from your uniform  
But you can't get it out of your eyes  
  
Nothing is capsulized in me  
On either side of town  
The streets were never really mine  
Not mine these glamour gowns

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons  
Skated over ten clear frozen streams  
Words like, when you're older, must appease him  
And promises of someday make his dreams  
And the seasons they go round and round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now  
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him,  
Take your time, it won't be long now  
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true  
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty  
Before the last revolving year is through  
And the seasons they go round and round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return, we can only look behind  
From where we came

I'm stalking the slot that's hot

Jingling in the lucky jackpots  
They keep you tantalized  
They keep you reaching for your wallet  
Here in fools' paradise!  
  
I talked to a cat from Des Moines  
He said he ran a cleaning plant  
That cat was clanking with coin  
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp  
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it

Three lemons  
Three cherries  
Three plums

You get a little lucky and you make a little money!

He picked out a booth at Circus Circus  
Where the cowgirls fill the room  
With their big balloons  
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose!  
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears  
And lions, pink and blue there  
He couldn't lose there!  
  
Des Moines was stacking the chips  
Raking off the tables  
Ringing the bandit's bells  
This is a story that's a drag to tell  
(In some ways)  
Since I lost every dime  
I laid on the line  
But the cleaner from Des Moines  
Could put a coin  
In the door of a John  
And get twenty for one

In ice and greens  
And old blue jeans  
And naked in the roses  
Then you got into funny scenes  
That all your work discloses  
  
""Lady, don't love me now I am dead  
I am a saint, turn down your bed  
I have no heart,"" that's what you said  
You said, ""I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you""  
  
Somewhere in a magazine  
I found a page about you  
I see that now it's Josephine  
Who cannot be without you  
I keep your house in fit repair  
I dust the portraits daily  
Your mail comes here from everywhere  
The writing looks like ladies'  
  
""Lady, please love me now, I am dead  
I am a saint, turn down your bed  
I have no heart,"" that's what you said  
You said, ""I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you""  
  
I gave you all my pretty years  
Then we began to weather  
And I was left to winter here  
While you went west for pleasure  
And now you're flying bock this way  
Like some lost homing pigeon  
They've monitored your brain, you say  
And changed you with religion  
  
""Lady, please love me now I was dead  
I am no saint, turn down your bed  
Lady, have you no heart,"" that's what you said  
Well, I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you  
  
When I first saw your gallery  
I liked the ones of ladies  
But now their faces follow me  
And all their eyes look shady

He put her in a ranch house on a hill  
She could see the valley barbecues  
From her window sill  
See the blue pools in the squinting sun  
Hear the hissing of summer lawns  
  
He put up a barbed wire fence  
To keep out the unknown  
And on every metal thorn  
Just a little blood of his own  
She patrols that fence of his  
To a Latin drum  
And the hissing of summer lawns  
Darkness  
Wonder makes it easy  
Darkness  
With a joyful mask  
Darkness  
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness  
No color no contrast  
  
A diamond dog  
Carrying a cup and a cane  
Looking through a double glass  
Looking at too much pride and too much shame  
There's a black fly buzzing  
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice  
Hissing summer lawns  
  
He gave her his darkness to regret  
And good reason to quit him  
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale  
That nobody sits in  
Still she stays with a love of some kind  
It's the lady's choice  
The hissing of summer lawns

Joni Mitchell,The Jungle Line,/j/joni+mitchell/the+jungle+line_20075359.html,"Rousseau walks on trumpet paths  
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz  
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes  
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights  
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews  
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine  
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue  
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line  
  
In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer  
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear  
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive  
They'll eat a working girl like her alive  
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand  
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines  
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band  
He hangs it up above the jungle line  
  
The jungle line, the jungle line  
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time  
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind  
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in  
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke  
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine  
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats  
Charging, chanting down the jungle line  
  
There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb  
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room  
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet  
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit  
And metal skin and ivory birds  
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines  
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge  
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line

And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday  
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe  
You laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes  
They're full of moon  
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you  
All those pretty lies, pretty lies  
When you gonna realise they're only pretty lies  
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies  
  
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed  
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr  
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie  
And she said ""Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close.""  
""Richard, you haven't really changed,"" I said  
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head  
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs  
You punched are dreaming  
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet  
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?  
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet  
  
Richard got married to a figure skater  
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator  
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on  
And all the house lights left up bright  
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out  
I don't want Nobody comin' over to my table  
I got nothing to talk to anybody about  
All good dreamers pass this way some day  
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes  
Dark cafes  
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings  
And fly away  
Only a phase, these dark cafe days

Whenever the words ran dry  
Behind the lash and the circles blue  
He looked as only a priest can, through  
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you  
And my eyes said, let us try  
  
He said, ""You wouldn't like it here  
No it's no place you should share  
The roof is ripped with hurricanes  
And the room is always bare  
I need the wind and I seek the cold""  
He reached post the wine for my hand to hold  
And he saw me young and he saw me old  
And he saw me sitting there  
  
Then he took his contradictions out  
And he splashed them on my brow  
So which words was I then to doubt  
When choosing what to vow  
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine  
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines  
And he asked for truth and he asked for time  
And he asked for only now  
Now the trials are trumpet scored  
Oh will we pass the test  
Or just as one loves more and more  
Will one love less and less  
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in  
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin  
Saying let them lose, crying let them win  
Oh make them both confess

For so many years  
Tethered to a ringing telephone  
In a room full of mirrors  
A pretty girl in your bathroom  
Checking out her sex appeal  
I asked myself when you said you loved me  
""Do you think this can be real?""  
  
Still I send up my prayer  
Wondering where it had to go  
With heaven full of astronauts  
And the Lord on death row  
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones  
Call out and clamour to be found  
Caught in their struggle for higher positions  
And their search for love that sticks around  
  
You've had lots of lovely women  
Now you turn your gaze to me  
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection  
To see if I'm worthy  
Like the church  
Like a cop  
Like a mother  
You want me to be truthful  
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though  
And I need your approval  
  
Still I send up my prayer  
Wondering who was there to hear  
I said ""Send me somebody  
Who's strong, and somewhat sincere""  
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones  
I called out to be released  
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements  
And my search for love  
That don't seem to cease

And no toil or danger  
Just mercy and plenty  
Where peaceful waters flow  
Where peaceful waters flow  
  
Come all you fair and tender school girls  
Be careful now--when you court young men  
They are like the stars  
On a summer morning  
They sparkle up the night  
And they're gone again  
Daybreak, gone again  
  
If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor  
What a killing crime this love can be  
I would have locked up my heart  
In a golden sheath of armor  
And kept its crazy beating  
Under strictest secrecy  
High security  
  
I wish I had the wings  
Of Noah's pretty little white dove  
So I could fly this raging river  
To reach the one I love  
But I have no wings  
And the water is so wide  
We'll have to row a little harder  
It's just in dreams we fly  
In my dreams we fly!

Rent free suite  
Big blue pool that you sun by  
Trips to tropic shores  
Clothes from fancy stores  
You want too much  
You want too badly  
You want everything for nothing  
  
Going to the church  
You chant  
For my downfall  
Chanting for my house  
My friends  
You want it all  
The pillows on my bed  
The visions in my head  
You want too much  
You want too badly  
You want everything for nothing  
  
In the land of litigation  
The courts are like game shows  
Take what's behind the curtain  
The jury cries  
I'm not going to be the jackpot  
At the end of your perjured rainbow  
Not if local justice has even one good eye  
  
Oh it's not like I was blind  
I saw  
But I took no action  
As you began to climb  
Green clawed  
Dissatisfaction  
It wasn't hard to guess  
That the end would be a mess  
You want too much  
You want too badly  
You want everything for nothing  
  
In the land of mass frustration  
The judges are sleeping  
Counting wooly little lawyers  
And grinding their teeth  
Outside my sleepless window  
The hollywood sirens are shrieking  
While down some searchlit alley runs  
Some lost belief  
  
Oh I'm tangled in your lies  
Your scam  
Your spider web  
Spit spun between the trees  
Doors slam  
You want my head  
You'd eat your young alive  
For a jaguar in the drive  
You lie too much  
You lie too badly  
You want everything for nothing

Letters from across the seas  
Roses dipped in sealing wax

Tucked into a paperback  
  
Guess I'll throw them all away

Dark with darker moods is he  
Not a golden Prince who's come  
Through columbines and wizardry  
To talk of castles in the sun  
  
Still I'll take a chance and see  
I found someone to love today  
  
There's a sorrow in his eyes  
Like the angel made of tin  
What will happen if I try  
To place another heart in him  
  
In a Bleeker Street cafe

And that's not easy  
Dragon shining with all values known  
Dazzling you-keeping you from your own  
Where is the lion in you to defy him  
When you're this weak  
And this spacey...  
  
So what are you going to do about it  
You can't live life and you can't leave it  
Advice and religion-you can't take it  
You can't seem to believe it  
The peacock is afraid to parade  
You're under the thumb of the maid  
You really can't give love in this condition  
Still you know how you need it  
  
They open and close you  
Then they talk like they know you  
They don't know you  
They're friends and they're foes too  
Trouble child  
Breaking like the waves at Malibu  
  
So why does it come as such a shock  
To know you really have no one  
Only a river of changing faces  
Looking for an ocean  
They trickle through your leaky plans  
Another dream over the dam  
And you're lying in some room  
Feeling like your right to be human  
Is going over too  
Well some are going to knock you  
And some'll try to clock you  
You know it's really hard  
To talk sense to you

Were supposed to sleep tight  
That's why I got into the vodka one night

Before I came to  
Now do you think I was crazy  
I may have been only three  
But I was swinging

They all laugh at Edison  
And also at Einstein  
So why should I feel sorry  
If they just couldn't understand  
The idiomatic logic  
That went on in my head  
I had a brain  
It was insane  
Oh they used to laugh at me  
When I refused to ride  
On all those double decker buses  
All because there was no driver on the top  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head  
But I said dear doctor  
I think that it's you instead  
Because I have got a thing  
That's unique and new  
To prove it I'll have  
The last laugh on you  
'Cause instead of one head  
I got two  
And you know two heads are better than one.

Sing me that hymn that you so loudly  
Sang in church with mom.  
Sing it again to me and fill me  
With all your words of wisdom.  
  
Comforting words of love when I  
Would get home from school in tears.  
Somehow your songs have stayed within me  
Down through all the years.  
Once when my younger heart was broken  
Your shoulder was there to cry on.  
Sing me those songs I know will linger  
Long after you have gone.  
  
I am standing at the threshold  
Of a chapter in my life  
I am asking for your blessing  
As I'm about to be the wife  
Of a man I know who loves me  
And I'm proud to be his bride.  
Dad the time has come for me to leave your side.  
  
So, sing me a song again, Daddy.  
Sing me a lullaby.  
Wrap me inside your arms, Daddy,  
'Though this is not goodbye.  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart. When times get rough  
The ones I'll most remember  
Are your songs of love.  
  
Jose:  
  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart. When times get rough  
  
Cheri:  
  
The ones I'll most remember  
Are your songs of love.

Until there's nothing but sky

Not the kind that you want to find waiting  
To return you to the night  
Dizzy from the height  
  
Coming from the hat, studying the hat  
Entering the world of the hat  
Reaching through the world of the hat  
Like a window  
Back to this one from that  
  
Studying a face  
Stepping back to look at a face  
Leaves a little space in the way like a window  
But to see it's the only way to see  
  
And when the woman that you wanted goes  
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""  
But the women who won't wait for you knows  
That however you live

Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat  
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat

They won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go where I've longed  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Unclean minds mislead the pure  
The innocent will leave for sure  
For them there is a resting place  
People sinning just for fun  
They will never see the sun  
For they can never show their faces  
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who will take more than he will give  
He will give  
He will give  
He's hardly going to give  
Ohhh  
  
The greed of man will be  
Far away from me  
And my soul will be free  
They won't go when I go  
  
Since my soul conceived  
All that I believe  
The kingdom I will see  
'Cause they won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go  
Where I'll go  
No one can keep me  
From my destiny.

You're still an inspiration  
Can it be  
  
That you are my forever love  
And are you watching over me  
From up above  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for a while to know you're there  
A breath aways not far to where you are  
  
Lie gently sleeping  
Here inside my dream  
And isn't faith believing  
All power can't be seen  
As my heart holds you  
Just one beat away  
I cherish all you gave me  
Everyday  
  
Cause you are my forever love  
Watching me from up above  
And I believe that angels breathe  
And that love will love on  
And never leave  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight

Che sciocco io  
io che ti ho dato tutto di me  
Ora che vai  
stai portando il mio cuore con te.

svaniscono in te

Una storia di amanti  
ma a la fine vai via

Questa citta' che mi penso  
deserto di lacrime  
Sento il cuore affogato in me  
Mentre tu sei con lui

Non perdi mai  
Io mi sento morire ormai

At times I can't move  
At times I can't hardly breathe

When you say you love me

You're the one I've always thought of  
I don't know how but I feel sheltered in your love  
You're where I belong  
And when you're with me if I close my eyes  
There are times I swear I feel like I can fly  
For a moment in time  
Somewhere between  
The heavens and earth  
I'm frozen in time

Tears of faith temper my soul

Somewhere I hear sirens wailing through the night

More to life than black and white  
  
I'd never thought I'd question (thought I'd question)  
The doubt I'm seeing everywhere (doubt I'm seeing everywhere)  
Standing here beside me you're the answer (you're the answer)  
When I lose my faith you're there

Face the fire, in a world gone wild  
You're the fortress in my life  
Seeing the world through a child's eyes  
They can't fool me now  
I don't believe it's all a world gone wild  
  
It's a lie, the more you get the more you want, it leads to nowhere  
Should have learned by now  
What is life without someone to share  
The mountains that you climb to reach the sky  
With everyone uncertain (everyone uncertain)  
The future's never really clear (never really clear)  
Standing here beside me you're the reason  
I found my faith again with you here

They can't bring me down  
I don't believe it's all a world gone wild  
  
Now you can count on me to keep you safe  
I'll be your shelter from the storm  
Come lay down with me, and let our spirits melt us into one

There's loads of things I'd like to do if I could find the time  
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime

Shattering my world again  
Free fall but never can  
Ever reach the ground again  
Dark eyes scanning in  
Feel my mind explode within  
  
Wanting much more  
I implore you  
Near to death's door  
To ignore  
  
The screams of all  
  
Who fall before

Piercing through my brain

Leading me in  
From out of the night  
Staying on course I'm still alive  
I had to confess I never thought I would ever survive  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now I'm found  
  
Focused on my altered state  
I would just disorientate  
Suffering alone amongst the crowd  
  
Drifting on a sea of doubt  
And no one ever heard me shout  
That I was lost and couldn't find my way  
  
No one at hand  
Having no plan  
Stumbled through a barren land  
  
After so long  
Of going wrong  
I found the road  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now I'm found

I had hit the ground  
I was lost but now I found

To survive  
You've got to believe alone  
You'll rise  
  
Starting to run  
Shedding the load  
Now I can see I'm close to home

Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad.  
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see.

All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down

Crushed and bolted all the grain  
At every wind what a stake we're in

We see red and then  
Deep inside our blood begins to boil

Eventides when I'm afraid  
I'll never know when you'll appear

In the dark when I write  
Telling fortunes for my life  
I'm sitting here by candle flame  
When will you arrive again  
  
Embers ignite once again  
I watch them dance around the flame  
Sparks start to fly  
I can't speak  
From seeing answers that I seek  
  
Shapes start to form as I stare  
The shadows taunt as if to dare  
Ghostly embrace takes my heart  
Now I surrender and it starts

Visions in the night  
Show me what is right  
Help me through the maze of mystery  
I will sell my soul  
Only I can know  
What the future holds  
And what will be  
  
Slowly my hand  
Turns the page  
It never ceases to amaze  
Fill me with hope if you can  
I will become a better man

Visions come into my mind  
And tell the future of mankind  
  
Only time will prove that I'm right

There's nothing I can do (There's nothing I can do)  
  
Such a lonely night  
Premonitions running wild  
I can see them now  
All alone I fantasize  
  
As daylight breaks  
Through the stars  
I wonder how I got this far  
As I leave my room  
And lock the door  
I know I'll live forever more

That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust  
  
I tried so hard to have you reach  
Another side of me  
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot  
  
So I wander on  
Asking where you might have gone  
From what I knew before  
Some things are worth fighting for  
  
Desert heat can wear you down  
But still I'm rollin' through  
Did I see your figure in the haze  
  
I am driven by a thirst  
To quench myself of love  
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid  
  
Night road leads me to a town of ghosts  
Beckoned by the glow of kerosene and tumbleweed  
They're calling out (They're calling out)  
Forevermore (Forevermore)  
Worth fighting for  
  
I'm leaning in the wind  
Head bowed down from what I saw  
My shadow for a friend  
Still some things are worth fighting for

The beasts of the field,

He worked six days long  
Gettin' it right

""Gabriel,grab your horn and call some friends""  
And then all the saints came marchin' on in

You can give me a little rock 'n roll  
Or even a waltz with the lights down low  
I'll still be dancin' when they close the door

This girl's ready to paint the town

The time has come to take your love-torn hearts off your sleeve  
Look, look about you, what, what do you see?  
Love-sick, love-lorn, love-wrecked, love-worn, boo-hoomanity  
There'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse  
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe  
Are we mice or are we men? Can't you see the light?  
Come you fellow victims lets unite  
Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes  
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues  
Down with things that give you that well-known pain  
Take that moon and wrap it in cellophane  
Down with love, let's liquidate all it's friends  
Moon and June and roses and rainbows' ends  
Down with songs that moan about night and day  
Down with love, just take it away, away  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds and the bees and the Viennese  
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with signs, down with Cupid  
Ruttle that stuff that duff  
Down with love  
Down with love  
Down with love  
Down, down, down with love

Soon the whole street starts to shake  
When you hear they hear the drummer boy!

He's so nimble on the symbol  
Bing bong, ding dong

Every day's a happy day  
Everything will be OK

Watch this cat, spin those drums  
Swing it Brother, beat that hyde!

When the church bells ring,  
Like the angels sing,  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree  
[Repeat]  
For a very merry Christmas time.

Judy Garland,"On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe",/j/judy+garland/on+the+atchison+topeka+and+the+santa+fe_20491986.html,"What a lovely trip  
I'm feeling so fresh and alive  
And I'm so glad to arrive  
It's all so grand  
  
It's easy to see you don't need a palace  
To feel like Alice in Wonderland  
Back in Ohio where I come from  
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travelled some  
  
But I never thought I'd see the day  
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe  
(Wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe)  
I would lean across my window sill  
  
And hear the whistle echoin' across the hill  
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)  
  
With the wheels a-singin' ""westward ho""  
Right from the day I heard them start  
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico  
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart  
  
When I'm old and grey and settled down  
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town  
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
All aboard! (we came across the country lickety-split)  
(Rollin' ninety miles an hour)  
I can't believe I'm here at last  
Woo-oo-ooo!  
  
(When you go travellin', it's best for you  
To take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!)  
I can't believe that anything could go so fast  
Then you pull that throttle, whistle blows  
  
A-huffin' and a-puffin' and away she goes  
All aboard for California, hey!  
On the Atchison (on the Atchison)  
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka)  
  
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka)  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!

Judy Garland,Poor Butterfly,/j/judy+garland/poor+butterfly_20823581.html,"There's a story told of a little Japanese  
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees  
Miss Butterfly's her name  
A sweet little innocent child was she  
Till a fine young American from the sea  
To her garden came  
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day  
And he taught her how to love the American way  
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn  
Then he sailed away with a promise to return  
  
Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting  
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so  
The moments pass into hours  
The hours pass into years  
And as she smiles through her tears  
She murmurs low  
The moon and I  
Know that he'll be faithful  
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by  
But if he won't come back  
Then I'll never sigh or cry  
I just must die  
Poor Butterfly

And all because of the man that got away.  
  
No more his eager call,  
The writing's on the wall,  
The dreams you dreamed have all  
Gone astray.  
  
The man that won you  
Has gone off and undone you.  
That great beginning  
Has seen the final inning.  
Don't know what happened.  
It's all a crazy game!  
  
No more that all-time thrill,  
For you've been through the mill,  
And never a new love will  
Be the same.  
  
Good riddance, good-bye!  
Every trick of his you're on to.  
But, fools will be fools,  
And where's he gone to?  
  
The road gets rougher,  
It's lonelier and tougher.  
With hope you burn up,  
Tomorrow he may turn up.  
There's just no letup the live-long night and day!  
  
Ever since this world began  
There is nothing sadder than  
A one-man woman looking for  
The man that got away,  
The man that got away.
