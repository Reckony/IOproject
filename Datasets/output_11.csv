Justin Bieber,Been You,/j/justin+bieber/been+you_21104166.html,"[Verse 1]  
Feeling the reminisce  
Gone in an instance  
Blink of an eye  
No goodbye  
I had a notion  
Deep as the ocean  
Blue like the sky  
Oh my  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
But we're the blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
(Woah, woah, woah)  
If I had the chance  
If I had the chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Verse 2]  
There repercussion  
Of missing your loving  
Haunts me at night  
The ghosts are alive  
All of the memories  
Of serenity  
Dwindle in my mind  
All the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
Who was to blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no

How could you be so heartless?  
  
You were my sun

But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no  
  
You know why?  
Cause in the night, I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
That's why I said,  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said ""what's up?""  
Yeah, I'm gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh  
  
I want the money, money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose

Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)

And Daddy I live outta town

You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here

When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again

At the table with the family,  
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,  
Then it gave a lil' flicker then  
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,  
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,  
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,  
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,  
I said cool, cool,  
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger,  
Before we work I gotta get this off,  
See the other family members and drop gifts off,  
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,  
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,  
People everywhere and all our twitter followers,  
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!

JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the stand,  
It's crazy how some people say they don't care,  
When there's people on the street with no food it's not fair,  
It's about time for you to act merrily,  
It's about time for you give to charity,  
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,  
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,  
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,  
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,  
So I think some of you need to act bold,  
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,

Running in the same place

Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?

With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out

Showed you how to read a map

Said it ain't over

Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down

From what the world may see

My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me

When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
Never say it, never, never say it  
  
I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)  
I never thought that I could feel this free  
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)  
  
'Cause there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
'Cause this is my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Here we go  
Guess who?  
J-Smith and J-B!  
I gotcha lil' bro  
I can handle him  
Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Never say never  
  
I will never say never (never say never)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
  
And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)

Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck  
  
It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?  
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap  
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica  
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego  
  
It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is  
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us  
Fly walls down in the fly halls  
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall  
All about money tied in a know stand over there  
That's why I make it happen on blocks  
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather  
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta

Where she's going I swear nobody knows

Listen to Wu Tang  
Trying crazy suits on  
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's

Open up the door when you take her to the movies  
  
When you meet the parents you tell De Niro  
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo  
Next show they gotta up the zeroes  
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old  
  
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me  
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me  
The young youth rocking the gold tooth  
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules  
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'  
You looking good fly color Asian  
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia  
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia  
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's  
(Sweet runaway love)  
Guess that's the day she became a runaway love  
  
I'm runnin outta time  
Where is my runaway love  
Searching low and high

I give it all up for her  
I'll never be enough

My runaway love  
  
Why can't I find, the love of mine,  
When you're standing in front of my face  
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine  
How did I let you get away  
  
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly  
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck  
Grabbing em on set  
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get  
Take that queen assure to ya  
We can live every month baby girl just call me up  
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes  
Even the stress  
  
My mind is a terrible thing to waste  
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss  
Me my lady left my homies  
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony  
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling  
I need my honey in my life get that film it  
Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine  
My runaway love give me mine come on

She dances 'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep...  
  
She dances at the break of dawn

She can't be late, can't take too long  
The kids must get to school

For a man who just won't appreciate  
  
And don't know it takes  
And was all in vain.  
Still she could not stop,  
Couldn't break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore she'd dance no more  
But then she did, she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home, home

And maybe I could change my everyday, but baby I don't want to

To take my mind off missing you  
And I know in my heart, you can't say that you don't love me too  
Please say you do, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What will I do if I can't be with you  
Tell me where will I turn to, baby who will I be  
Now that we are apart, am I still in your heart?  
Baby why don't you see that I need you here with me?

Justin Timberlake,Hallelujah,/j/justin+timberlake/hallelujah_20869243.html,"Well I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the lord  
But you don't really care for music, do ya?  
  
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Maybe there's a god above  
All I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
And it's not a cry you can hear at night  
Not somebody who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hi, my name is Bob, and I work at my job  
I make forty-something dollars a day  
I used to be the man in my hometown  
Till I started to lose my way  
  
It all goes back to when I dropped out of school  
Having fun, I was living the life  
But now I got a problem with that little white rock  
See, I can't put down the pipe  
  
And it's breaking me down  
Watching the world spin 'round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friends around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
[Bridge]  
Can anybody out there hear me?  
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself  
Can anybody out there see me?  
'Cause I can't seem to see myself  
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere  
Can you save me from this hell?  
Can anybody out there feel me?  
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself  
  
[Chorus]  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way?  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way?  
  
Now you gotta understand I was a family man  
I would have done anything for my own  
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch  
So I ended up all alone  
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz  
See, I thought I was living the life  
And the craziest thing is  
I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes  
  
And it is breaking me down  
Watching the world spin 'round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friend around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?

[Chorus]  
  
Oh my god, please forgive me  
(Father, hear my prayer)  
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life  
If I could do it all again  
Have just one more chance  
To take all those wrongs and make them right

You was pink as ice single need to think it twice  
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night  
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice

Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening  
Cat got your tongue?  
  
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone  
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone  
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along  
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own  
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character  
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender  
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders  
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired  
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder  
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter  
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad  
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag  
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport  
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy  
When it came to dope I was quick to export  
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport  
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport  
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud  
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from  
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne  
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms  
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns  
I shed a tear before the nights over  
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh  
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over  
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller  
I'm makin' love to the angel of death  
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps

What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent  
What is you talking, man? That ain't important  
Illuminati, High society  
We in this party and nobody invited me  
We going crazy and I always use my best sense  
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince  
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and  
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and  
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and  
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre  
You just look stupid to be ignoring  
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium  
And parties at Richie is getting risky  
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me  
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed  
Ah, get out my fucking head  
It's just me and my bad bitch  
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt  
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with  
Before I betray them I slit my wrists  
At the top is just us nigga  
Cause I don't really trust niggas  
And we made it through the hurricane  
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane  
We gon' make it, that's on everything  
Truest girls get half naked, every spring  
They saying, ""Hey Kanye  
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""  
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain  
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break  
On the radio, man I miss myself  
I need to just step back and kiss myself  
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt  
A little lower.. that's what's up  
Somebody pour her another cup  
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?  
I swear until my time is up  
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Palms rise to the universe  
As we moonshine and molly  
Feel the warmth we'll never die  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
You're a shooting star I see  
A vision of ecstasy  
When you hold me I'm alive  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
  
I knew that we'd become one right away  
Oh right away  
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays  
I saw the life inside your eyes  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

And have you car twisted like a blunt  
For you faggot a-s n-ggas that like to front

In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron  
You hating and you want to erase it  
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it  
My flow interupts your homeostasis  
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis  
You talk street sh-t it sound like sweet sh-t  
Straight liquorice you n-ggas sound ticklish  
80k large for the Hermes dream  
Coke n crop in all your magazines  
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine

High off life this high technology, Devry  
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology  
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived  
So gimme that, gimme that, keep going  
Where my city at, I'm like steak and fries but never die  
They wanna Ghostface wanna be me  
But they will post haste follow me into the after life  
That means you going right after I've  
But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow  
So some way some how I have survived  
Who is he that we see coming over the tides  
In a speed boat, boat load of pride  
Full of rum, dress shirted and mastermind tie  
He what happens when rappping and fashion collide  
So omg is the ""C"" from the C-are-S lol'ing at you haters

Loud as a badass child level

Could you explain how high is your zone  
We'll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine  
There's hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame  
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants  
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France  
Diamonds blue, business manager's Jewish  
And if I get sued my lawyers Jews  
Some girls do, grab the cojones  
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us  
Brand new ferrari's I gotta make the donuts  
C-are-S is like a hip hop Chris's bonus

I was too busy flying, parasail!

Half of that's to Cindy's  
Hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy  
Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me  
Props in New York but Chi town's the city  
Get my city hoochie's Gucci, Monica Bellucci's

Somebody please say grace so I can save face

Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it

Who knew that life would move this fast?  
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?  
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it

And keep your face to the risin' sun

Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch  
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon  
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room  
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom

We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz

Before you ask me to get a job today,  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars

But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars

(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only

They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'  
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'  
And Jesus, one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'

Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation  
I was really makin' myself, they competition  
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game  
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains  
Just picture man, no snitchin' man  
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man

'Til I pulled out my map  
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas  
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more  
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game

I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all  
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'  
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses  
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'  
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard  
Man look at your haircut  
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks

Kanye West,Homecoming,/k/kanye+west/homecoming_20447623.html,"I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
I met this girl when I was 3 years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me  
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""  
And from that point I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking 'bout me  
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you  
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you"" and I just got through  
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
Maybe you, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oh, now I'm coming home again

Or here to convert atheists into believers

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape  
But if I talk about God my record won't get played  
Huh?  
Well let this take away from my spins  
Which will probably take away from my ends  
Then I hope this take away from my sins

A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi

Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt

When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off

My life's work to the friends I make,  
I give them what they want to hear.

But my love was young, and felt  
The world was not cruel, but kind.  
  
Where Lagan's light fell on the hour,  
I saw him far below me--  
Just as the morning calmed the storm--  
With no one there to hold him.  
  
My loves have come, my loves have gone,  
And nothing's left to warn me,  
Save for a voice on the traveling wind,  
And the glimpse of a face at morning.

They're setting fire to the cornfields  
As you're taking me home

Will now mean you and here

At you happy without me

Out of my mind  
Trying to keep him at home  
Out into Rome  
In the early hours  
Leaving me here  
Like Tamlaine in her Tower  
You are going  
To the empty bullring  
Taking your red cloak  
To regain something  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, you rolling matador  
Kill in your eyes  
For the toro  
That shut the door  
To glory and gore  
The throw of the rose  
It's all you lived for  
But you've lost it all  
  
Your red streak  
On the plot where many feet  
Left it incomplete  
But you kept the meaning  
You feel him charge again  
And you feel him cut you down  
Right on the spot  
Where you thought  
You were ground for good  
These flights of fantasy  
Make your wounds more sore  
But you've every right  
To even grab at the last straw  
Oh, Lord

Kate Bush,The Handsome Cabin Boy,/k/kate+bush/the+handsome+cabin+boy_20216416.html,"'Tis of a pretty female  
As you may understand  
Her mind being bent for rambling  
Unto some foreign land  
She dressed herself in sailor's clothes  
Or so it does appear  
And she hired with a captain  
To serve him for a year  
Her cheeks - they were like roses  
And her hair rolled in a curl  
The sailors often smiled and said  
He looked just like a girl  
But eating of the captain's biscuit  
Her colour did destroy  
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell  
The handsome cabin boy  
'Twas in the bay of Biscay  
Our gallant ship did plow  
One night among the sailors  
Was a fearful flurry and row.  
They tumbled from their hammocks  
For their sleep it did destroy  
And they sworn about the groaning  
Of the handsome cabin boy  
""Oh doctor, dear, oh doctor,""  
The cabin boy did cry  
""My time has come, I am undone  
And I will surely die.""  
The doctor come a-runnin'  
And a-smilin' at the fun  
To think a sailor lad should have  
A daughter or a son  
The sailors when they saw the joke  
They all did stand and stare  
The child belonged to none of them  
They solemnly did swear  
The captain's wife, she says to him  
""My dear, I wish you joy  
For 'tis either you or me's betrayed  
The handsome cabin boy!""

In a corner brooding.

In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy.  
There's something very real in how I feel, honey.

It's in me.  
It's in me,  
And you know it's for real.  
Tuning in on your saxophone.  
  
The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing  
Shadows on your saxophone, a surly lady in tremor.  
The stars that climb from her bowels,  
Those stars make towers on vowels.  
  
You'll never know that you had all of me.  
You'll never know the poetry you've stirred in me.  
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly,  
I've never known or felt in myself so rightly,

Kate Bush,The Seer,/k/kate+bush/the+seer_20622736.html,"Long ago I beard a tale  
I never wilt forget  
The time was in the telling  
On the bank the scene was set  
  
The sky was rolling blindly on  
The daylight had not gone  
She washed her hair among the stones  
And saw what was to come  
  
All this will pass  
There will be blood among the corn  
And heroes in the hills  
But there is more to come my boy  
Before you've had your fill  
  
Men will come and rope the sail  
As though it were their own  
And they will bathe their feet in oil  
As I have bathed my own  
  
All this will pass  
All things must come  
Just as I tell you here  
  
Stones will stand together  
As if searching for the stars  
And all come crashing down again  
Before they reach too far  
  
She turned to face the setting sun  
I turned to walk away  
But then she called my name again  
And beckoned me to stay  
  
All this will pass  
All things must come  
Just as I tell you here  
  
She told me of the famous sons  
Who write their names in peace  
Yet be cut down before the time  
Has come for our release  
  
Just as I tell you here  
  
Even now  
I wait for the coming day  
Even now  
She waits in the dawn  
  
For the tales she tells  
For the gifts that she will sell  
For the sight she knows  
For a vision that still grows  
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen  
  
I listened for so long that day  
That I can hardly tell  
If what she said was heaven sent  
Or brought to bear in hell  
  
That men of hope would stand alone  
And still be cast a lie  
Just as Romans cast them  
On the day they were to die  
  
All this will pass  
  
There is more of what she told  
Much better left alone  
For who are we to question her  
Who stands among the stones

Stuck in a single period  
Can't get out this time

You're Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed  
You fight you break up  
Never kiss or make up  
You don't really wanna say, no  
But you don't really wanna go, oh  
Cos' you're hot n your cold  
You're Connor and Joe  
Been out with Miles and James  
Your love always changed

Futuristic lover  
Different DNA  
They don't understand you  
You're from a whole nother world  
A different dimension  
You've opened my eyes  
Now I'm ready to go  
Lead me into the light  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your lovin  
Fill me with your poison  
Take me, ta-ta-take me  
Wanna be your victim  
Ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien  
Your touch so foreign  
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
Do you ever feel  
Like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
Do you ever feel  
Feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
Do you ever feel  
Already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
Cause there's a spark in you  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the 4th of July  
Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show em what you're worth  
Make em go oh oh oh  
When you shoot across the sky-y-y  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon

Throwin' away things that matter

But soon maybe

Here's what I've learned  
The Lord's not the one to blame  
  
For He's not just a religion  
With steeples and bells  
Or a salesman who will sell you  
The things you just want to hear  
  
For his Love was such  
That he suffered so much  
To cause some of us  
Just to follow, follow  
  
So many laughing at Jesus  
While the funniest thing that he's done  
Is love this whole stubborn rebellious world  
While their hate for him just goes on  
  
And love just like that  
Will bring him back  
For the few he can call his friends  
The ones he's found true  
Who've made it through  
Enduring until the end

And he will divide the nations before him, as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats.  
  
And she shall put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left,  
And he shall say to the sheep come ye, blessed of my father,  
Inherit the kingdom I have prepared for you from the foundation of the world,  
For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat,  
I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink,  
I was naked, and you clothed me,  
I was a stranger, and you invited me in,  
I was sick, and I was in prison, and you came to me.  
Thank you! enter into your rest.  
  
And they shall answer him, yes, they shall answer him,  
And they'll say, lord, when?  
When were you hungry lord, and we gave you something to eat?  
Lord, when were you thirsty? I can't remember.  
And we gave you drink?  
  
Huh, when were you naked lord, and we clothed you?  
And lord, when were you a stranger and we invited you in?  
I mean, we invited lots of people in lord. I could never forget that face.  
  
And lord, when were you sick and we visited you?  
Or in prison, and we came to you? lord, tell us?  
In as much as you did it to the least of my bretheren, you've done it unto me.  
  
Oh yes, as much as you've done it to the very least of my bretheren, you've
done it,  
You've done it unto me. enter into your rest.  
Then he shall turn to those on his left, the goats.  
Depart from me, you cursed ones, into everlasting fire,  
Prepared for the devil and his angels.  
  
For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat,  
I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink,  
I was naked, out in the cold, in exposure, and you sent me away,  
I was a stranger, and I knocked at your door,  
But you didn't open, you told me to go away,  
I was sick, racked in pain upon my bed,  
And I begged, and prayed, and pleaded that you'd come, but you didn't,  
I was in prison, and I rotted there,  
I'd prayed that you'd come.  
  
I heard your programs on the radio, I read your magazines, but you never came.  
Depart from me!  
Lord, there must be some mistake, when?  
Lord, I mean, when were you hungry lord and we didn't give you something to
eat?  
And lord, when were you thirsty, and we didn't give you drink?  
I mean, that's not fair, well, would you like something now?  
Would one of the angels like to go out and get the lord a hamburger and a
coke?  
Oh, you're not hungry, yeah, I lost my appetite too.  
  
Uh lord uh, lord, when were you naked,  
I mean lord, that's not fair either lord,  
We didn't know what size you wear.  
Oh lord, when were you a stranger lord,  
You weren't one of those creepy people who used to come to the door, were you?  
Oh lord, that wasn't our ministry lord. we just didn't feel led, you know?  
Lord, when were you sick? what did you have, anyway?  
Well, at least it wasn't fatal, oh, it was?  
I'm sorry lord, I would have sent you a card.  
Lord, just on last thing we want to know,  
When were you in prison lord? what were you in for anyway?  
I had a friend in levenworth  
Enough!  
  
In as much as you've not done it unto the least of my bretheren,  
You've not done it unto me.  
In as much as you've not done it unto the least of my bretheren,  
You've not done it unto me. depart from me.  
And these shall go away into everlasting fire.  
But the righteous into eternal life!  
And my friends, the only difference between the sheep and the goats,  
According to this scripture,  
Is what they did, and didn't do!!

Without you I'd survive, but I'd have to have the notion  
That I could live this life, just going through the motions  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high  
It's never gonna touch the sky, without you.  
  
Mm, without you  
Without you, baby, baby, baby without you  
Without you.

And whispered in my ear, guess who  
I rattled off names like I really didn't know  
But all along I knew it was you  
  
And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed  
And wondered why we didn't last  
It had been a long time, but later last night  
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early  
To know if this is gonna work  
All I know is you're sure looking  
Good in my shirt  
  
That's right  
You look good in my shirt  
  
Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight  
Every way that we went wrong  
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing  
Every morning from now on

I wasn't in touch with anymore  
There was a way I used to feel  
I knew what was and wasn't real  
  
You built a bridge, I tore it down  
I felt safe on shaky ground  
And I was a master of despair  
Making believe I didn't care

I shouldn't be standing here today  
After all the crazy things I've done  
I'm ready to fall and that's OK  
I ran as far as I could run  
You won  
  
Out of a world turned upside down  
It took some time to come around  
Out of a dream you made me whole  
Yes you did  
You lit a fire down in my soul  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And you won  
  
I'm ready to fall  
I thought I knew what I was doing  
I thought I was in control  
I thought nobody could slow me down  
But what did I know  
I was just a kid, a motherless child  
No one to watch over me I was runnin' wild  
Free of all responsibility 'til my life  
And my love for myself caught up with me  
Yeah, it caught up with me  
And now I'm (ready to fall), yes I am  
So ready

With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate

Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms  
I've been tryin' my best to get along  
But that's okay  
There's nothing left to say, but  
  
Take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But you'll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  
  
I went out driving trying to clear my head  
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left  
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this  
And all the baggage that seems to still exist  
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name  
Is not knowing what we could have been  
What we should have been  
So  
  
Take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But you'll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better  
But you'll think of me  
  
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind  
Don't worry, I'll be fine  
I'm gonna be alright  
While you're sleeping with your pride  
Wishin' I could hold you tight  
I'll be over you  
And on with my life  
  
So take your records, take your freedom  
Take your memories I don't need 'em  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
'Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

'Cause we got nothing left to weather

She was singing to me  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
My daddy said if you want to live  
You better not touch this is not a toy  
The truth is boy I'm a bloody fool  
I left the one I loved behind, singing  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you

You haven't changed a bit  
You didn't think that I'd remember

Made a wish on every star  
In that clear September sky  
One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups  
At three a.m. I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And that's somethin'  
That just don't happen twice  
  
To this day I still taste that first kiss  
How I prayed it wouldn't end  
In a way seeing you like this  
I guess it never really did

He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite  
Seems there was nothing that he didn't know  
And as a kid I believed 'cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He talked Daddy into letting me have my first car  
I thought I was really something 'til Becky Thompson broke my heart  
That first taste of love really did me in  
Getting over her slow  
And I knew someday I would 'cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He said life is made for you to live  
The best love is the love that you give  
There'll be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go  
And I live by those words 'cause Grandpa told me so  
  
I promised him I wouldn't cry when it was his time to leave  
That's the only promise I made him I couldn't keep  
He smiled from his bed and said we'll meet again  
Somewhere down the road  
And I believe 'cause Grandpa told me so

There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true  
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground  
I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down  
  
There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home  
You've got a way of doing little things that turn me on  
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown  
With your hair still up in curlers I still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down  
  
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face  
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place  
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around  
And if I can I know that I'd still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear

A secondhand ""Old Man and the Sea""

And the struggle and the strife, what's wrong and what's right  
Has got me searching for the light and my place of peace

Wrapped around your ring

When I watched it sink

When they started talkin' 'bout the steps you take  
Mistakes you make, the hearts you break and the price you pay  
I almost walked away  
You could hear a pin drop when this ole man  
Stood up and said, I'm gonna say it again like I do every week

Everything you love starts to disappear  
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear  
Have another shot, just one more beer  
I've been there, that's why I'm here  
  
This ole boy stood up in the aisle  
Said he'd been living a life of denial and he cried  
As he talked about wasted years  
I couldn't believe what I heard  
It was my life word for word  
And all of a sudden it was clear

Fell in love in the heat of passion  
Oh, but passion has it's price  
Under all that beauty  
Beat a heart that was made of ice  
God knows as far as I could see she didn't have a flaw

The softer the skin  
The sweeter the love  
The more bitter the end

The bigger the fool the harder the fall  
  
One day she was lovin' me  
The next day she was gone  
And I became another verse  
To a lonesome heartbreak song  
Now that I've learned to face the truth

I'll be flying home a thousand times  
In all my sweetest dreams  
I can see the glow in your eyes  
As we sit by the fire  
Like lovers we knew long ago  
While we watch our angels in the snow  
When december comes  
  
We'll be trying to remember  
Where we packed our woolen winter clothes  
Only heaven knows  
When december comes  
We'll be hanging pine and holly  
Singing all the songs we sing at christmas  
Home is ever near  
Hearts return no matter what we do  
And love  
Will build a bridge  
And I will always be there with you  
When the autumn leaves have gone to gold  
And swallows know  
December's calling  
I'll be flying home a thousand times  
If only my dreams  
And I see the glow in your eyes  
As we sit by the fire  
Like lovers we knew long ago  
While we watch our angels in the snow

Find a little love and let it dawn

And then you filled my world up with laughter

Happening before my very eyes.  
  
Everywhere the cements growing,  
In the street the traffic's flowing,  
Ruining the air up in the skies,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
Near the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine and be free,  
Be free (Be free, be free)  
  
I can hear the cities calling,  
Come on down I can feel you falling,  
Happening for all of us to see.  
  
See the deepening cement hollow,  
Reaching out for those who follow,  
Hunkering on far too many lies,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
In the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine,  
And be free (be free, be free) and be free.  
  
From the winds so far away,  
I've had an inner vision,  
I've seen the universe unfold.

I can hear the school bell ringing,  
From the yard the children singing,  
Merrily life is but a dream.  
  
In the street there go the brothers,  
Selling slow and ship to others,  
Aiding those who's songs have turned to cries,  
Is no surprise.  
  
I want to get away and live my life,  
In the rivers and trees,  
I want to spend my days making wine,  
And be free, and be free, and be free(be freee...)

You give your life away  
For what in return  
One chance to see your name in lights

And working a way  
To keep you on the road  
And moving day to day

You put your money aside  
To call it all your own

And you think you're gonna advance  
Turn around, there's Uncle Sam  
He's got his hand down your pants

This is the time to bring them back.  
What were the promises,  
Caught on the tips of our tongues?  
  
Do we forget or forgive?  
There's a whole other life waiting to live when,  
One day we're brave enough  
To talk with conviction of the heart.  
  
And down your streets I've walked alone,  
As if my feet were not my own,  
Such is the path I chose,  
Doors I have opened and closed.  
  
I'm tired of living this lie,  
Fooling myself, believing we're right when,  
I've never given love,  
With any conviction of the heart.  
  
One with the Earth, with the sky, one with everything in life,  
I believe, we'll survive, if we only try.  
  
How long must we all wait to change,  
This world bound in chains that we live in,  
To know what it is to forgive,  
And be forgiven?  
  
It's been too many years of talking now.  
Isn't it time to stop somehow?  
Air that's too angry to breathe, water our children can't drink  
You've heard it hundreds of times  
  
You say you're aware,  
Believe and you care,  
But do you care enough,  
Where's your conviction of the heart?

Kenny Loggins,Isabella's Eyes,/k/kenny+loggins/isabellas+eyes_20496653.html,"Somewhere out in space  
A moonlit face was watching  
Lookin' to find a time to become.  
Slowly two lovers lay hypnotized  
Holding the moment in their eyes.  
World in changes.  
Lightly one by one,  
We try to hide the mirrors.  
But baby they just keep turnin' up  
And I know you can't look away from you  
When you're lookin' in into  
[CHORUS]  
Isabella's eyes  
Shine your light and make your mama smile.  
All our angels come  
To welcome the awakening one  
Awakening wonder  
(Repeat Chorus after second verse, then go down to 3rd verse)  
(Repeat Chorus after third verse)  
Once I met a man who knew where he was goin'  
And let everybody tag along.  
But suddenly love had another plan.  
Shook him and took him by the hand.  
World in changes.  
'N' there's a boy I know  
Believes that he's in danger  
He'll never give up without a fight.  
If you open your heart  
There's no way to lose  
So just surrender to  
[BACK TO CHORUS]  
Millions of dreams are part of the plan,  
But you are the one dream that's real.  
This changes everything  
Now that I am  
In the spell of Isabella's eyes.

There's only one.

I'll give you more than you've asked for  
  
And there are those who can foresee  
Where we will go

You might think that I've not gone to school on you  
Baby like it or not, I ain't nobody's fool  
My illusion nation become a sound surprise  
You may turn to deny it  
To the place when the clouds stops the wind in the face  
Leaves you dumbfounded there in his waste  
I'm going all the way  
Sooner or later, gotta love somebody  
I don't care how long it takes  
Like a shot to the heart, I've got news for you  
Maybe I'm not so smart, but I'm nobody's fool  
I'm going all the way (Ooh yeah)  
I'm going all the way (Nobody's fool baby, nobody's fool)  
I don't care how long it takes (I don't care... Listen to the right)  
I'm going all the way (Who's fooling who?)

Gentle refrains of summer mornings  
The first rays of sunlight  
And dew-dropped roses  
  
Winds rolling through falling leaves  
Whistling in the sycamores  
These are her songs of love  
  
She needs to be reassured  
of all of the hope you hold for her  
And when the lady loves you  
Don't ever let it go  
Take your world into your arms  
And let your feelings show  
  
And she, never will leave  
Always these memories will stay with me  
And I'll think of her now and then  
  
She, she needs to be reassured  
of all of the hope you hold for her  
And brother, when the lady loves you

Always these memories will stay with me

And I saw, it all there in a different light,  
Just when I thought I was out of the rain,  
Suddenly I'm in a hurricane,  
And all around me voices in the wind.  
  
Say again, what I know I know,  
It's time, it's time, to learn about letting go,  
Why does it feel like I just exist,  
Stuck out here on the precipice?  
  
They say the future's out of our hands,  
So why is it making demands?  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
I knew a man, I held his hand,  
When I was just a child,  
He showed me his dreams  
I watched him let 'em die  
  
If I could stand again by his side,  
I'd tell him that love is why we're alive,  
That's what I tell the world I believe,  
So why can't I listen to me?  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
Welcome to sunrise in paradise,  
The light of the dawn, is burning my eyes,  
And that's just where I want it to be.  
  
If I have to make up my mind,  
Maybe now is the time to decide.  
Every minute makes it harder on me,  
Why must it be now or never?  
  
If I finally get to make up my mind,  
Girl then now is the time to decide.  
Somebody tell me why I do this to me,  
Why must it be now or never?

But now I see what I believe

Whether my world's sayin' I'm wrong  
Wherever my heart goes, that's where I belong

I follow the way that it feels  
And heaven has never been more real  
  
When you looked into me  
And you laid your hands on me  
At once the deaf could hear  
The blind could see  
Now that I Know Love  
  
I was a child alone, asleep  
You came along and cradled me  
You took me in your arms  
And rocked me so sweetly  
I'd prayed for love  
To come to pass  
How do we know if love will last?  
And if it can't then someone tell me  
What we're livin' for  
I don't know what tomorrow holds  
But I know what I know

Tumble down together like the snow

Is melting by the roadside  
On the wind a serenade  
Of children's voices singing I believe

Coming back again this year  
  
Sentimental melodies  
Surround me like an old friend  
Spent a winter here with me  
Silently we watched the seasons change  
And they change so fast  
Fade away

And loving me tonight.  
Somewhere out there,  
Someone's saying a prayer,  
That we'll find one another,  
In that big somewhere out there.  
And even though I know how very far apart we are,  
It helps to think we might be wishing  
On the same bright star,  
And when the night wind starts to sing  
A lonesome lullaby,  
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the  
Same big sky.  
Somewhere out there,  
If love can see us through,  
Then, we'll be together,  
Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true.

When love soaks you to the bone  
'N then those moments leave you wonderin'  
If you'll lose your mind or lose control  
  
Life is nothing without love  
Love is nothing if not freedom  
  
They tell me the gates of hell  
That you shake 'n you rattle  
Are secretly locked from inside  
  
[Chorus]  
You hope 'n pray you'll find  
The one thing on your mind  
Not until you know  
The Art of Letting Go  
'N it may seem to be  
Defying gravity  
That's because they know  
The Art of Letting Go  
  
You may think  
You built a present perfect world  
And you may wonder to yourself  
Does anyone really know what else could ever matter?  
  
But the Man with His hand  
On the hammer  
Wears a velvet glove  
  
Does the rich man know he's poor?  
Does the beggar care for much more than survival?  
  
When you look into the eyes of children laughing  
Do you remember who you were?  
Or who you are?  
  
Life is nothing without love  
Love is nothing if not freedom  
  
They tell me the gates of hell  
That you shake 'n you rattle

And day by day  
The rain turned to snow

What Christmas really means

There was a girl  
Lived around the corner  
With eyes as black as Mary's must have been  
I wonder  
  
Does she miss her friend  
I remember the day  
All the bells were ringing  
As I watched her cross the churchyard in the snow  
  
And all my searching  
for all I lack  
Is just trying to get that feeling back

Too early for my heart,  
To open up again.  
  
But when I see you I just laugh,  
And I believe, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.  
  
Ooh, Darling, welcome to the wind,  
As we sail our ship of dreams into uncharted waters,  
Forget about the stars, and love will lead you higher,  
So girl, let's ride the wind.  
  
Surrender to the sun,  
Surrender to the moon,  
Surrender to the rain,  
Surrender to the stars,  
Surrender to your heart,  
Surrender to the wind.  
Take a chance,  
Open up, let me love again.  
  
Surrender to the sun,  
Surrender to the moon,  
Surrender to the rain,  
Surrender to the stars,  
Surrender to your fears,  
Surrender to your tears,  
Take a chance,  
Open up, let me love again.

The sentimental fool don't see

What had yet to be created once in her life  
She musters a smile  
For his nostalgic tale  
Never coming near what he wanted to say  
Only to realized  
It never really was  
She had a place in his life  
He never made her think twice  
As she rises to her apology  
Anybody else would surely know  
He's watching her go  
But what a fool believes he sees  
No wise man has the power to reason away  
What seems to be  
Is always better than nothing  
And nothing at all keeps sending him ...  
Somewhere back in her long ago  
Where he can still believe  
There's a place in her life  
Someday, somewhere, she will return

By silent walls we build along the way  
Why be alone to learn that your life has more?

Tear down those angry walls. I'll walk with you where you go

I was back in time at our old address  
  
Sitting in the drive  
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves  
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree  
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon  
  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
They added on where we thought we would  
You always said it would sure look good  
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall  
  
Looks like they picked up right where we left off  
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun  
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun  
I could see us there together  
  
Seemed the sky was always blue  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue

Oh, I'd relive my life with you

He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold  
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him  
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.  
  
In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known  
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown  
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart  
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall  
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all  
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light  
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.  
  
He had marched for politicians, served under their command  
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand  
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way  
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt  
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget  
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring  
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.

No matter what the future

Jealousy and hate  
Woman meets man  
And man must have his mate

So the story's told  
We remember Christmas Day  
When winter days grow cold  
  
With the time it passes by  
We put away the trim  
Then we live and wonder why  
We can't remember Him  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
It's Christmas everyday (christmas everyday)  
  
It's not the bells and it's not the snow  
And it's not the gifts we get  
But He was born so long ago  
It's easy to forget  
  
Peace on earth, good will too men  
But men can't go alone  
We get lost along the way  
But He can bring us home  
  
Remember Him throughout the year  
Without the star above  
He left us all a Christmas gift  
He left the gift of love  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
And it's Christmas every day

Kenny Rogers,Coat Of Many Colors,/k/kenny+rogers/coat+of+many+colors_20077860.html,"Back through the years  
I go wandering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall the box of rags  
Someone gave us  
And how my mama put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
""But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be.""  
Now I know we had no money  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
Made just for me

Hurting cause I'm too concerned

I sat down and asked her name  
When the drinks finally hit her  
She said I'm no quitter  
But I finally quit livin' on dreams  
I'm hungry for laughter  
And here ever after  
I'm after whatever the other life brings

And I closely watched him  
I thought how he looked out of place  
He came to the woman  
Who sat there beside me  
He had a strange look on his face  
The big hands were calloused  
He looked like a mountain  
For a minute I thought I was dead  
But he started shakin'  
His big heart was breakin'  
He turned to the woman and said  
  
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille  
With four hungry children  
And a crop in the field  
I've had some bad times  
Lived through some sad times  
But this time your hurtin' won't heal  
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille  
  
After he left us  
I ordered more whisky  
I thought how she'd made him look small  
From the lights of the bar room  
To a rented hotel room  
We walked without talkin' at all  
She was a beauty  
But when she came to me  
She must have thought I'd lost my mind  
I could'nt hold her  
'Cos the words that he told her  
Kept coming back time after time

I'm longing in love, falling apart  
I follow my heart straight to your door.  
  
Face to face with all honesty  
I will be grateful if you'd give to me:  
Just one night to lay in your arms  
  
Give me just one night could it be that I was born  
To make every dream you ever had come true  
In just one night, oh one night with you.  
  
Standing this close the sound of your voice  
Leads me no choice I offer my love  
Am I so wrong to think you might fall  
'cause baby you're all I can think of.  
  
Face to face ....

He felt every word he ever sung  
And when it came to singin', Lord  
He showed them how it's done

With the story of Felina and the cowboy in her arms

He went against the grain  
And he always spoke his mind

Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?  
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down,  
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.  
  
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war,  
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore,  
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be,  
Oh Ruby, I still need some company.  
  
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed,  
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize,  
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around,  
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.  
  
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door,  
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before,  
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground,

Wondering what laid beyond as far as you could see

Or maybe just to spread your wings and feel that you are free.  
  
Runaway girl, there's someone here who loves you  
And understands you, you're not alone  
Runaway girl, I won't stop until I found you  
And put my arms around you and take you home.

Knowing someone down the line has found your heart of gold  
Castles sometimes crumble and too often dreams were shattered

Kenny Rogers,Scarlet Fever,/k/kenny+rogers/scarlet+fever_20175836.html,"I stood outside the Lucky Star  
Staring at the flashing sign  
It read: come on in and watch young  
Scarlet's body come alive  
Let her dance for you and catch your spell  
You'll swear you can believe her  
Be careful not to catch the scarlet fever.  
So I paid my fare and walked down front  
And found an empty chair  
As I settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair  
The moves her body made while the music played  
Were the likes I've never seen  
And she became the envy of my dreams.  
One by one her teasing movements  
Brought the crowd out of their seats  
And all at once young scarlet  
Danced straight up in front of me  
From the moment that her eyes found mine  
I've never been the same  
Scarlet locked another heart upon her chain.  
Now I get scarlet fever every time I see her  
But she's a night club teaser  
Not paid to notice me  
Yes, I get scarlet fever  
If she knew how much I need her  
She'd place her hand in my hand  
And dance away with me.  
She looked 25 but I was told  
That she was just 16  
She had a way of making a man believe  
She danced for only him  
As she tantalized I fantasized  
And felt the sound of my heart beat  
And every night I'd dream  
She'd fall in love with me.  
Then one night while driving in  
My eyes begun to tear  
'Cause the sign outside the Lucky Star said: scarlet isn't here  
she'd left that day to find a life  
of bigger and better things  
and she left behind my chain of broken dreams.  
But still get scarlet fever  
In my mind I still see her  
Out there dancing somewhere  
To another fool like me.

And sometimes all the nights can be so long  
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone  
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light  
And quietly she says how was your night?  
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  
  
[Chorus]  
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me  
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world  
With my little songs, I was wrong  
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully  
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right  
I will find a way, find a way  
  
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite  
Then I see my old guitar in the night  
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end  
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two  
And I'm torn between the things that I should do  
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

The sunshine's quietly standing at my door

My heart is silently breaking  
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor.  
  
Once again the whole town will be talking  
It's more I've seen the pity in their eyes  
They could never understand  
It's her sorrow not a man  
  
No matter what they say I know she tried  
Baby's packed her soft things  
And oh she's left me  
I know she never meant to make me cry  
  
It's not her heart Lord  
It's her mind she didn't mean to be unkind  
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye.

Checks her machine and she feeds the cat  
She's almost asleep, before she turns out the light  
  
In her dreams, she rides wild horses

The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook  
And to d.b. cooper and the money he took  
You can look for answers but that ain't fun

How about them days and now  
You don't know what to say  
Ain't it funny how the sun can shine  
And hide away  
  
And its a long way on a they say highway

A lonesome freeway of uncut my way  
Can you feel me comin  
I'm tombstone ugly and if you judge me  
Bettah wathc for me comin  
In a 59 drop top blood red cadillac  
  
Knock knockin  
Black bob at your door  
Still rockin  
Everybody say that  
Knock knockin  
Lookin for the payback  
  
They used to say ritchie boy  
He got no sense  
But now they say oh bobby man  
He was my best friend  
  
Ain't it funny how the glory and the stories  
And the times can change  
And no sense ritchie just  
Bought himself a big fuckin airplane

Hung in the crack hoods  
Learned to pimp  
Like a mack should  
  
I could have been a rich man like pops  
I never kissed ass  
And those days since passed  
Here I stand like jesus  
  
I don't need this  
Fuck you ho's can squeeze this  
I can't believe this  
I'm so wasted  
  
From all the fruits of life  
That I've tasted  
Never a clone on the microphone  
I got shit built up  
  
'Cause I never felt loved at home  
And all alones how I spend my free time  
Writin' freal rhymes  
Drinkin' cheap wine  
  
Easy whips  
And a cracker  
I'm the master blaster  
No one cuts faster  
  
The king of disaster  
Is who I am ho  
And I'll be rippin the fuckin ryhmes  
And ill make you mother shit her pants bro

My only home was in your soul  
I know that I can't stay here  
And drown in a pool of tears  
Should I pack my pride and face this life alone

Worn and weathered, scared to go home  
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)  
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused  
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now  
Most people don't, but some people do

My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin for a battle  
Out on the plains I'm just a loner  
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin me a boner  
  
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley  
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me  
And we didn't even fuck  
I gave my last gold tooth 'n gold nugget to get my dick sucked  
  
3 days out on the frontier  
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer  
I need a slut for a service  
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous  
  
Man I gotta get my rocks off  
'cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft  
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a desperate rado  
Didn't take any practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote  
Horny as a toad trippin off peyote  
Holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack  
  
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack  
And to the law I'm no stranger  
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger  
And then Tonto tried to get down  
  
So I boned his bitch slit he's throat and then I skipped town  
That's the way I run my show  
Paint towns red  
Fuck hoes and then I lay low  
  
I know you think I'm archaic  
But my dick's like a sword  
I see pussy and want to slay it  
Out on the plains it gets linely  
  
Sometimes I feel homely  
New faces  
New towns no one knows me  
Guns cocked in my holster  
  
You see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster  
I'm always lookin for the quick buck  
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt  
Some say my head's hollow  
  
Fuck em... I'm just a

Desperate rado  
Trottin through the bad lands  
A desperate rado  
Tokin down with all the cowhands  
A desperate rado  
Didn't take much practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow  
In any town I can be found at the local bordello  
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,  
  
And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons  
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin  
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin  
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand  
  
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand  
I'm a low down buckaroo  
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too  
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad  
  
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had  
Known as the ruff ridin Texan  
A bad buck from the day of my inception.  
And I was raised in the poor house  
  
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house  
Now since the day I left the corral  
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal  
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside  
And told me that high was the best way to ride...  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Now I'm a desperate rado  
Always lookin for a fight  
A desperate rado  
Puffin on a peace pipe  
I'm a desperate rado  
On the run from the law  
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw

It seems like freedom has never had a man so scared  
  
Times might change, love it comes and goes  
How I wish I could have shown you how deep for you my love goes  
And I know this might seem crazy, I would end my life for you  
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you  
Hey I'd do it for you

Times they change, love it comes and goes  
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes  
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you  
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you  
Yeah, I'd do it for you  
  
Listen to me  
I wonder how long it takes to see  
There's nothing more I want than you here with me  
Freedom's been knocking, but I refuse to let her in  
  
Times they change, love it comes and goes  
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes

Unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise  
I've realized one thing, how much I love you  
And it hurts to see, see you cryin'  
I believe we can make it through the winds of change  
  
God is great indeed  
If you believe, in the everlife  
Yeah we gotta  
Make some sense of the piece that's not defined  
And if you just hold on, I won't let ya fall  
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change  
  
Though I walk through the valley of darkness  
I am not afraid  
'Cause I know I'm not alone  
  
And if the wind blows east, would you follow me  
And if the wind blows north, would ya stay your course  
And if the wind blows west, would ya second guess  
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out  
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine  
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away  
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be  
And walk this road through life with me  
You know I love youuuuuu

I was running from time my friend  
I've lost another war  
So I poured one more, and went home drunk again  
  
She was up when the key hit the lock  
And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise  
I saw it in her eyes  
She'd be gone before the evening  
  
So I poured another strong one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
With a brand new start  
I swore I'd love from the heart  
I meant to change my ways  
But I've seen better days  
  
Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm  
With a wife and kids at home  
With a job somewhere on some assembly line  
I wish I had that life  
I bet you wish you had mine  
  
So I poured another tall one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
Dude, what station is this, K snooze  
Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass  
He's putting me to sleep  
Nudge me if he gets over five decibels  
I knew his first album was the good one  
  
But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam  
All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand  
Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit  
So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch  
  
I won't switch, won't quit no vices  
Flip the script cause I'm a slice the righteous  
Haven't you heard I don't refrain  
Free as a bird, and so I won't change  
  
Livin' it up, givin' it up, fuckin' shit up, what  
I'm a run the track from the D to Nantucket  
So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it  
Yeah, and it don't, and it don't  
  
With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place  
I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind  
So I'll see you when I'm sober  
I been looking for some reasons  
But I ain't found one down in Texas

I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I've been livin a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time  
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven  
  
And I believe it stems down from my family situation  
I never liked my old man  
I couldn't stand to be around him  
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah  
My heart turns to stone and I think of this  
  
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
You never loved me, you never held me tight  
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night  
You tried to make me think that your ways were best  
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress  
  
Life it's the ultimate sin  
A game with no rules that you're expected to win  
My personal hell's hidden with a grin  
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin  
  
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool  
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool  
You should've went to school like your bigger brother  
But you played the fool with a different color  
  
Runnin' ship with a whip  
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped  
Money made you so wise  
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes  
  
Do as I say and not as I do  
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you  
And oh the pain how it hurts  
It was always your home and your business that came first  
  
You said a man is as good as his word  
But your mind was closed and mine never heard  
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured  
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard  
  
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree  
Look at you then look at me...  
  
You ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me  
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see  
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me  
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free  
  
Now I know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy  
And I know at times I was not always there for you  
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time  
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime  
  
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college  
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all  
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us  
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you  
  
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so  
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so  
  
I always loved you I always cared for you  
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through  
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know  
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know  
Dah  
  
Alright, get down baby

I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I need somebody please, please help me

Hey, hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
Hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
I am, I am  
Tell me who I am, am, am  
Tell me  
Tell me

If it sounds good, you'll hear it...  
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it...

Packed my shit and left home like the prodigal son

I went looking for fame and yo I've never been back  
  
Filled with spite staying high as a kite,  
I was dealin and stealin everything in sight  
Pool hustling trying to make that green,  
I've been ramblin and gamblin since the age of 13  
  
Working like a bitch like a god damn tank,  
Some disagree because my rents had bank  
But all that's gold non't always glitter,  
So I'll take another puff from my one hitter  
  
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,  
Blow all my cash on cheap women and wine  
'Cause money, money, money ain't shit to me,

I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way  
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go  
  
I hope that one she'll see and she come in to my show  
Please God, please I'll pay any cost,  
If you'd just stop the world cause I want to get off  
  
There's too much hardship there's too much pain  
There's too many motherfuckers tryin to get in my brain  
I've been to your mountains I've been to your seaside,

And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot  
'Cause I hold key to my own success,  
And suckers that step willll be put to rest, yes,  
  
I hold the key to my own success,  
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest,  
So pass the buddha,  
The funky tie hooter,  
  
And watch me rip because I'm such a slick shooter.  
Not a generic dime a dozen m.c.,  
Never was in a posse never wanted to be

Now I've been walkin the earth since the beginning of time,  
And won't leave till I've received that 7th sign  
All this talk their gonna drop the bomb,  
  
But life keeps going on and on and on and on  
The world's end don't worry me,  
And I'm gonna get where I'm going just hurry me  
'Cause I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushin,  
  
Everything is slow motion like I'm trippin on tussin  
Fussin with the girls they waste my time,  
Thrashin and bashin going out of my mind  
Crucified by the critics everyday,  
  
'Cause I ain't really got that much to say  
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,  
I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time  
I live my life just like the skipper,  
  
But only at night because I'm a day tripper  
Twitchin-shakin,  
And I kick more bass then John Paul Jones  
Visions of red shoot through my head,  
And I won't stop trippin till the day I'm dead

Many nights she comes to me  
She feels me where I lay  
I hope to God one day she'll see that my love is not that way  
She holds me in the morning time and never lets me go

The times I turned the party out  
And how I stood against an army all alone  
Drinkin' wine and stayin' high  
And realized it couldn't last  
And how I turned myself around  
And went down another path  
And the signs we must observe  
When life's changes do occur

Just how proud I am of them  
And always have a good time

Now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder

When ya first meet em ya think he's O.K.  
  
But then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way  
Hear say here I say through the grapevine  
He squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line  
Just like a little fuckin' fag  
  
He always wants to get high but never has a bag  
Never works says he can't find the right job  
Ain't got a dime and when he does he's a tightwad  
He's the dampest there's no one damp  
  
Huh huh.... he's the mother fuckin cramper  
Now the crampers red, there's no one redder,  
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater  
He's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer  
  
You come home he's at your house drinkin' your last beer  
Pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him  
Always wearin' out his mother fuckin' welcome  
And then sporty's never that cautious  
  
He sips from your forty and he always backwashes  
Talk about a certain subject, he'll jinx it

The desert wind is howling  
Rattlesnakes and romance  
Is filling with the rain  
Candy apple red dress  
Bleeding when she kissed me  
Heaven in a rag top  
Take away my pain

When your highs are low

Pink and dirty neon  
Settle on the hood  
Wrap your arms around me  
Come a little closer  
Stumble in the twilight  
And fell onto the floor  
Loving Mona Lisa  
Dreaming of the free world  
Lipstick on the nightstand  
And demons at the door

When your hopes and dreams  
Lose the will to go

Reaching for the light  
Knowing we can't win

A glorious existence  
A simple celebration  
A place you've never been before  
Tell me that you wanna go  
  
Reaching for the light

When your highs are low

I carried the weight of our last fight  
Elvis singing ""don't be cruel""  
And I wonder if you feel it too  
It's like we're going under  
  
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line  
The question of my heart came to my mind  
  
If I go on  
With you by my side  
Can it be  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about those golden nights?  
  
Maybe a thief stole your heart  
Or maybe we just drifted apart  
I remember driving  
In my daddy's car to the airfield  
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield  
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust  
That paradise is buried in the dust  
  
If I go on  
With you by my side  
Can it be  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about those golden nights?  
(The way it was)  
  
All of our plans have fallen through  
Sometimes a dream, it don't come true  
  
Darling!  
Darling!  
  
If we go on  
Can it be (can it be)  
The way it was  
When we met  
Did you forget all about them golden nights?

Visions to their leaden flock  
Of rainbows' ends and gold.  
Now tales Prince Rupert's peacock brings  
Of walls and trumpets thousand fold  
Prophets chained for burning masks  
And reels of dreams unrolled . . .

A few and distant roads all leading away from here  
Nobody in the streets... decay  
I must follow the wolf again, I must follow her till the end  
  
The end  
The Wolf had turned around, facing higher ground  
And there it was... The House of God  
In awe I looked as time had stopped  
  
Follow me  
I had never seen a church like this before  
""This Place is terrible"" inscribed above the door  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within  
  
A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin  
Nobody in the church... decay  
Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night  
I wonder if God was ever here  
Or did he turn away in fear, did he turn away in fear?

From the candle of fate

The end is near, no more pain, ah you're free  
  
As the candle melts away the spirit of the candle girl  
Emerges from the flame, she doesn't seem the same  
With a smile on her face she starts to speak

You've got the answer, you will endure

Live by the good book  
That's what the wise men say  
But where does it leave us  
Were they right or were they wrong  
Gotta have hope, gotta carry on  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
It's alright, it's alright  
  
They want your soul and your spirit  
Make them understand  
These things they never can have  
Gotta work for your family  
A community built on trust, not money  
If this town was to vanish  
And the office blocks were just turned into ashes  
They'd be you and me, honey  
With the will to survive  
And the spirit lives on  
  
Build those factories  
Plants and cars  
On a planet so desecrated  
There'd better be life on mars  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How time slips away  
Live by the good book  
That's what the wise men say  
But where does it leave us  
Were they right or were they wrong  
Gotta have hope  
Gotta carry on  
  
It's alright, it's alright

I can't help thinking that  
It's only a disguise  
Cause underneath that core  
There's got to be more  
That what we realize  
  
Maybe they're scared  
To let the inside out  
Maybe they're afraid to  
Show what they're all about  
So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else  
Can work them out  
So they pull on all the heaviness  
But it's only an illusion heaviness  
Can't you see  
They're scared to  
Show a little bit of emotion  
In case a little bit of emotion  
Gives them away  
  
Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes  
She'll give you all her body  
That's if you've got the dough  
She'll let you see most  
Anything but there's one thing  
That she'll never show  
And that's a little bit of emotion  
A little bit of emotion  
In case a little bit of emotion  
Gives her away  
But it's a shame she's acting that way  
Somehow she's gotta get through every day  
And the only way  
Is not to show one little bit of emotion  
A little bit of true emotion  
In case of a little bit of emotion  
Gives her away  
  
People learn their lines  
And they act out their part  
Then they talk on cue  
But it's got no heart  
It's all on the surface  
And it's all contrived  
They're scared to come out  
Somehow they've got to survive  
  
Look at that looney  
With a smile on his face  
He knows no shame  
And feels no disgrace  
He's got a look in her eyes  
That makes it seem that he's from outer space  
Maybe that looney knows what's it's all about  
He's got something to say  
But he can't spit it out  
He's uncoordinated so we shut him out  
In case he shows a little bit of emotion  
A little bit of real emotion  
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion  
So we walk away  
Show a little bit of real emotion  
Show a little bit of emotion  
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion

Thought I'd never make, but I made it y'all, 'cause I had...

I know I'm now all I'm supposed to be, I'm gonna get it right, didn't get here
overnight, so while you're waiting please wait patiently

You know you always win cause you're

When I think about your name I go  
Ooh  
How you took away my pain I go ooh  
Every night at the club  
Ain't no wife at the club  
That Jesus he be showing me love  
They said I wasn't gon' make it kirk  
I know how that sound  
It's only by his grace I can say 'look at me now' if you love this joint right
here  
I want you to call your radio station in the morning  
And I want you to tell'em hey Mr. DJ  
Can you play my favorite song? (will you play my favorite?)  
I heard it say it's gonna get better we gon' make it out the hood someday  
Hey Mr. DJ  
I wanna hear that song about Jesus  
I heard my mama crying, I gotta let her know he's gonna wipe her tears away  
You are listening to the sound of a brotha' who should be dead right now  
But I'm so glad god didn't give up on me!  
Ain't you glad he didn't give up on you?

She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul  
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat  
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak  
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream  
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines  
Miss December you remember I bought you twice  
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price  
Had a sister that I barely knew  
Kind of got separated by the age of two  
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it  
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked  
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind  
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time  
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years  
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears  
  
Shout. Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
So come on  
I'm talking to you  
So come on  
  
Sex was how I made it through  
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?  
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man  
Show them you ain't no punk  
Get all the girls you can  
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today  
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way  
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes  
If you listening then remember I apologize  
I was raised falling in the church  
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church  
After service on the parking lot getting high  
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die  
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see  
Years of low self esteem and insecurities  
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues  
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me  
  
See I'm. See I'm  
Soul surviver. Soul survivor  
World survivor  
I just wanna let it go  
World survivor, soul survivor  
Just wanna let it go  
  
Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying  
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying  
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow  
Like that night mama died  
Hard to let it go  
You adopted me  
Cared for me  
And changed my name  
But I cursed at you  
Lied to you  
Left your pain  
It's not strange I can still see it in my head  
To know for hours you were laying in that bed  
If you listening to this record,  
If it's day our night  
If my mama still living treat your mama right  
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away  
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say  
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go  
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know  
The pain was preparation for my destiny  
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me

Tired of runnin?, tired of hurtin?, even got tired of me  
Tired of cryin?, tired of tryin? to forget my mistakes  
Tired of bein? in this storm, how much more can I take  
Many nights in my life, tell me why  
I shed more tears, my eyes would allow  
And after all that

Look at me now!  
I?m stronger this time around!  
Not because I was so good, but somehow  
You looked past where I was  
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me  
Look at me know!  
So many didn?t make it through  
That?s why this heart belongs to only You!  
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through  
Cause it grew me  
Look at me now!  
  
Had no hope, had no future, even too hard to dream  
No one told me, ?boy, you can be whatever you want to be?  
Then You saved me and You gave me reason to breathe again  
Not perfect, ya?ll, but I?m gon? run ?til I make it to the end

And you fight through the lies trying to find what?s for real  
Everyone wants the prize but they can?t stand the pain

To my people in the struggle, all my soldiers and believers  
To my survivors of Rita, Katrina and even FEMA!

Can?t let my past hold down my destiny  
And even though I don?t always know  
Why you allow the night to last so long  
But when I see the sunlight  
It was only to make me strong  
  
Look at me?  
Look at me?  
Look at me?  
Look at me, look at me

Look at me now!

And happiness was all mine  
It's hard to let my feelings show  
But I've got to let somebody know  
About the love that Jesus has given me  
He loosed my shackles and set me free  
Is this a dream or is it reality?  
Have I finally found someone who loves me?

Will you ever love somebody

Could there ever be anyone else  
Who can give me so much joy and peace  
And make everyday oh so sweet

Til I met His only begotten Son  
At first I didn't understand  
Until I saw the nailprints in His hand

Sorry I wish I could fix what's wrong

Sometimes wonder why am I going through

A High Priest who knows  
And who understands what you cannot say  
Just a little longer can you wait

Have you ever asked any of these questions?  
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen  
  
You have the power  
To make the seasons change  
The river flows for you  
The wind whispers Your name  
For me you left Your throne  
And traded crown for thorns instead  
I'm safe within not by Your skin  
But because Your blood was red  
  
Some say You're black, you're white  
They question if you're real  
We treat you like we treat ourselves  
I wonder how you feel  
To see your children fight in spite  
of the tears for us you've shed  
Doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins  
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross  
It doesn't matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
We may be different but  
The God we serve's the same  
Yet every Sunday we separate  
And bring the Father pain  
Your name is higher than any other  
Yet You took my place instead  
And now my sins are washed away  
Because Your blood was red  
  
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins  
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross

That makes me white as snow  
No other fount I know  
Doesn't matter what color you are

Was a little more respect from you  
  
I used to love you  
But now I feel abused  
I was a fool to be blind to the things you do  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
I'll never understand  
The habits of a man out on the town  
And where he hangs around  
  
Now you think it over  
Decide what to do  
I couldn't fall for your story if I wanted to  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
I tried to make you see  
That you were losing me but every day  
You still went out to play  
  
And now I'll say for the last time  
You had the chance  
And I won't dance for you baby like you want me to

The promises I make last nearly all night  
Still in the morning I run and I hide

Lost from the start all the friendships I make  
Single fares only the trails only I ride

It screws up your life and it makes you feel old

But the sun don't shine  
And the snow don't snow  
There's suzy-ann with her tits and curls  
Where mediocrity excels  
For those vicious boys and their boring girls  
You know it makes me sick but it's a bozo's world  
Then there's always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand  
You're in demand  
Your fifteen minutes start now  
City banker looks are in  
The heartless heart, the chinless chin  
And you'd spill your beans for just a pint of gin  
How you got so holy  
And became so thin  
In Sunday papers every week  
The silly words you love to speak  
The tacky photos and the phoney smiles  
Well it's a bozo's world and you're a bozo's child  
Then there's always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand

Autographs now and again  
People who saw you on blankety blank  
Or in the bank

They were wrong

'cause they couldn't stand the patter

Could I make you feel better?

You're much too scared of living  
And to die is a reliable exit  
So you push it and you test it

Got to take it got to grab it  
Got to get it up and shag it

She gets in trouble with the local law and order  
Everybody's happy when she isn't at the door  
She sends out invitations to everyone, they don't come  
And the phone ain't ringing for her now

Well they get older just like everybody else

You can work real hard or just fantasize

But right is only half of what's wrong.  
I want a short-haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.  
Now I'm steppin' outta this old brown shoe,  
Baby, I'm in love with you.  
So glad you came here, won't be the same now,  
I'm telling you.  
  
You know you pick me up  
From where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile  
Replacin' every thoughtless frown  
You got me excapin from the zoo  
Baby, I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here  
Won't be the same now, I'm tellin you  
  
If I grow up I'll be a singer,  
And wear rings on every finger.  
Not worryin' what they or you say,  
I'll live an' love and maybe someday,  
Who knows baby,  
You may comfort me  
  
I may appear to be imperfect,  
My love is sumthin' you can't reject  
I'm changin' faster than the weather  
If you and me should get together  
Who knows baby, you may comfort me.....  
  
I want a love that's yours,  
To miss is really sumthin' I'd hate.  
I'll get an early start,  
Makin' sure that I'm not late (Hey!)  
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue,  
Baby I'm in love with you

I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
Chain smokin' all jokin' aside  
Wishin' and waitin' and hesitatin' tryin' to take it all in stride  
Night flight back home everything's changed  
All night tonight my thoughts rearranged  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
  
Night hawkin' talkin' out of my head  
Hometown show down give me the lowdown  
But please don't tell me what you think I said  
Give me the feeling I'm on the right track  
Catch me a night train I ain't comin' back  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do

Kris Kristofferson,Border Lord,/k/kris+kristofferson/border+lord_20080499.html,"Darkness had us covered  
When we split from Minnesota in the morning  
In the rain  
  
Black as I was feeling  
And the street was slick and shiny as a snake  
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo  
Hangin' over in the brain  
  
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take  
Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard  
And leavin' every yesterday behind  
  
Learning every bridge you cross,  
Is burning down before you're off and  
Running  
Like the devil just in time  
  
Breakin' any ties before they bind you  
Taking any comfort you can find  
Running like you're running out of time  
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding  
When you're headin' for the border lord  
You're bound to cross the line  
  
Good lookin' women every time you stumble  
Waitin' there to catch you when you fall  
Gettin' to you bad enough to let em  
  
Keep you backin' up  
Till just before your back's against the wall  
  
Breakin' any ties before they bind you  
Takin' any comfort you can find  
Runnin' like you're runnin' out of time  
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding

Kris Kristofferson,Bread For The Body,/k/kris+kristofferson/bread+for+the+body_21055129.html,"I built my own chains in the land of the free  
A slave to a job that meant nothing to me  
With three shiny new cars and a split level home  
To furnish the tomb I was dying to own  
  
Then one day I wakened with fear in my eye  
Aware of a world that was passing me by  
And I knew that my savings of silver and gold  
Would mean not a thing when my body was cold  
  
Chorus  
Because life is a song for the dying to sing  
And it's got to have feeling to mean anything  
And a man can get by without silver or gold  
With bread for the body and song for the soul  
  
I'm living my life by the lesson I've learned  
And not looking back at the bridges I've burned  
Cause the time that we travel from cradle to grave  
Was meant to be spent and not meant to be saved  
  
And I know there are some who will say I'm a fool  
But I don't give a damn for the people that do  
Cause if down in a dungeon is where they belong  
Well, that's their misfortune and none of my own

Tellin' strangers who were sleepin'

With a baby on the way,

In the silence at her door

Ain't no fun to sing that song no more  
  
Got a song about a Savior,  
Lookin' lonesome and afraid,  
At a city full of strangers,  
And a cross He never made  
  
And He's sadder than He's wiser,  
And a longer way from home,  
And He wonders why His Father,  
Left Him bleeding and alone.

And a ""do not disturb"" on my door  
I sorta looked for some mess that she'd made  
Or her sweet little socks on the floor  
But all that she left here was too many rooms  
And just enough silence to break  
And I can't look at her picture right now  
Time's about all I can take.  
Last night I sewed up her toys that were torn  
And packed her suitcase again  
She looked so sweet as she lay there asleep  
Smiling and holding my hand  
We didn't talk all the way to the plane  
But she's too big now to cry  
Then when I kissed her, she held me so tight  
I couldn't tell her goodbye.  
Chorus:  
She said, ""I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart""  
It's not so bad out here living alone  
Comfort's a stranger away  
And there's a freedom you find on your own  
That's nearly worth what you pay  
It's just a shame she still wants us to be  
All that we seemed to before  
But we can't blame her for making believe  
Something we don't anymore.

We were friends, me and this old man  
Like desperados waitin' for a train

And an old school man of the world

And our lives were like some old western movie  
Like desperados waitin' for a train  
Like desperados waitin' for a train  
  
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him  
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe  
There were old men with beer guts and dominos  
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played  
  
And I was just a kid  
They all called his ""Sidekick""

I was grown and he was almost gone

And sang another verse to that old song  
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Left us with legends too great to ignore  
Stone-cut survivors of ancient dimensions  
Lost in the wonder they came to explore.

Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses  
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before  
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses  
And silver took it easy as the closing of a door  
  
Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows  
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes  
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows  
Following the line between her laughter and her lies  
  
But silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned  
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms  
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger  
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul  
  
Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him  
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes  
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken  
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise  
  
Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation  
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind  
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken  
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find  
  
And silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger  
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day  
And silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder  
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away  
  
Chorus:  
Because hunger, is the surface, of a darkened pool of sadness  
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below  
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness  
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

I sat me down by a tender young maiden whose eyes were as dark as her hair  
And as I was searchin' from bottle to bottle for somethin' unfoolish to say  
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows and smilingly stole
her away  
I said hey little girl don't you know he's the devil he's everything that I
ain't  
Hidin' intentions of evil under the smile of a saint  
All he's good for is gettin' in trouble and shifting his share of the blame  
And some people swear he's my double and some even say we're the same  
But the silver tongued devil's got nothing to lose I'll only live till I die  
We take our own chances and pay our own dues the silver tongued devil and I  
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him  
She knew in her heart that he'd lied  
But nothing that I could have said could've saved her  
No matter how hard that she tried  
Cause she'll offer her soul to the darkness and danger  
Of something that she's never known  
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger who'll love her and leave her
alone  
And you know he's the devil...
