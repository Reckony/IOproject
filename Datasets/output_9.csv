Horrible Histories,"Work, Terrible Work",/h/horrible+histories/work+terrible+work_20915264.html,"In good old Queen Victoria's day  
Industrial revolution  
Bosses said 'Please, we need more employees'  
We needed a solution  
  
Who will climb our chimneys?  
Who will power our grids?  
Victorian families to desperately poor  
They'll let us employ their kids for  
  
Work, terible work  
From very young ages  
Up chimneys to clean  
Paid pitiful wages  
Work, terrible work  
Pins make you work faster  
If we grow too big  
Get sacked by the master!  
  
Now you're all in my employ  
Cleaning in the factory  
We're not very strong  
And the hours are long  
This work is unsatisfactory!  
  
There not to get caught in spokes  
Or trap our hands in gages  
To stop machines and get you out  
Will cost you a week's wages!  
  
Work, terrible work  
There's no health and safety  
So if we get hurt  
They will just replace me  
Work, terrible work  
  
Now that I am short of cash  
I have to pick pockets  
Wallets from gentlemen  
And lady's lockets  
  
Small enough to get away  
Hardly ever caught  
And if we are, we're kids you see  
To cry is what we're taught  
  
Work, terrible work  
Dangerous and demeaning  
No time to complain  
Get back to your cleaning  
Work, terrible work  
Guess what we are dreaming  
School, glorious school!  
Wonderful school!  
Marvellous school!  
Wish we went to school!

Housemartins,Anxious,/h/housemartins/anxious_20066072.html,"I was walking by the river, I was asking myself questions  
But the answers I came up with didn't fit  
Some have breakfast in bed some aren't properly fed  
The way they talk about it makes me want to spit  
  
And they're raising all their eyebrows at the raising of the pound  
Whilst they raise another city to the ground  
And we're opening the doors and walking 'round on all fours  
Looking for a sense in lost and found  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
  
I really thought I'd have my tongue ties if I stood up to shout  
But all they did was listen without their ears  
And I thought I'd be beheaded if I stuck my neck out  
But they just gave me a hanky for my tears  
  
I have confidence in confidence, I hope that hope pulls me through  
But I think a little more is needed now  
We've got to form a congregation and sink down the nation  
Batter all the sinners to the ground  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious

Housemartins,Bow Down,/h/housemartins/bow+down_20066084.html,"Mother, Father, I think that I would rather  
Stay at home with you for another year  
That building's so tall and it makes me feel so small  
That I might get lost and simply disappear  
  
Evil smiles won't change my mind  
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind  
Why's that man rubbing his hands  
Looking at me writing down his plans?  
  
Today I have been molding plasticine  
and I made a little man who looked just like me  
His limbs were so weak and he couldn't move his mouth to speak  
And I could bend him into any shape I wanted him to be  
  
Evil smiles won't change my mind  
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind  
Why's that man rubbing his hands  
Looking at me writing down his plans?  
  
Those kids with the blazers on  
They went in with names on their elbows  
Came home with medals on  
Spit it out that's the way the story goes  
  
A flying start for the briefcase crew  
Oh, you didn't have to teach me like you did  
But you did  
And you didn't have to beat me like you did  
But you did  
But you did  
You did

Bruising hearts collecting gloom  
Seems no place to hide away  
From the hammer and caress  
Dress with passion  
Fashion for the parking lot  
Make some action  
Pushing time out of the clock  
Take away identity  
Parcel up what's left of me  
Water down the youthful drop  
Call the sane insanity  
  
All I want is to live with you  
All I want is to cry with you  
  
Dance til sunrise  
Reggae til the cows come home  
Fight the bigot  
Champion you're not alone

Juggling the fear and doubt  
Even when it's watertight  
In the end I have to say

Brutal murder (brutal murder)  
All hands to the slaughter  
Mass torture  
All hands to the knife  
  
And I can hear the screams  
With the knife, the jolt, the wring

Carrying a twisted sting  
  
Children's stories with their farmyard favourites  
At the table in a different disguise  
  
Don't talk to me of health  
Or something someone else will do  
We're talking about the act  
Of taking life for me and you

Selfish? Benevolent?  
What was his game

Some say a spy  
A hidden power

If felt quite deserted  
I climbed the stairs to where  
His body lay without motion  
No spirit lives in there  
The cord had been broken  
  
His skin was reptile  
No life in there  
Not young not old  
A long hollow glare  
His breath had stopped  
No hearts beat there

Should I believe hidden power  
They all wondered why  
  
My attention was caught  
By a sound from the door  
Panic gripped the mind  
What lay in store  
A being stared at me  
Benevolent, not cold  
Automaton - he is controlled  
  
His skin was reptile.....

And there's no way to keep a cheery face  
When the sight of your own reflection only breaks your heart  
And all your dreams have given up the chase  
Pick up the telephone  
You know I'm always home  
Any old time of night or day  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know

If you find a time when you just have to walk away  
Because of a call to pastures new  
You're in need of some fresh words to wish you on your way  
You need to fly on up and touch the moon  
Sharing this temporary weight  
No time to hesitate  
I will be everything you need  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first ...  
We're water breaking on an endless wave  
Potential bursting from the sea  
Compassion is what sets our minds apart  
Be cheerful when you break  
The chains of morality  
Oo, sharing this welcome weight

I will be everything you need

Like a thunderbolt out of the blue  
You kinda liked the way I came across  
But it always meant more to me than it meant to you  
  
Recalling a daydream I had as a child  
A half hidden memory from a more innocent time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If your heart is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
On your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So no need to be worrying  
No need to count the cost  
No separating the inside from the outside world  
No finding No loss  
  
I'm remembering something, so distant so fine  
Ancient, eternal and still ahead of it's time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
In your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So love with abandon  
Without judgement. Without fear  
With a confidence in tomorrow  
Love with a grin and a tear  
  
Not always reflected, not always fulfilled  
Love's not out to get you but wants you to build  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the sweetest of ways

At last the breeze began to play  
I drained my glass and turned to see  
Her face she smiled she spoke to me  
I told her my name I asked her the same  
She said they call me sky  
Sky  
Said she is in danger maybe a stranger  
Might know a place near by  
And she talked and she smoked little more than a job  
All the cares of my life went away on that day  
In that room coming out of the gloom  
And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on  
Life goes on  
Now you gone  
Life goes on after sky  
Life goes on after sky  
So much can change without a sign  
A twist of fate two worlds alight  
The words get spoken all worlds were broken  
The wind began to sign  
The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake  
Too soon the last goodbye  
And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies  
For the day of my birth was the last day on earth  
Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light  
I could see what I've done what must be from now on  
Life goes on  
Now you're gone  
Life goes on after sky

I reached for the one with the ultra-modern label, and wondered where the
light had gone  
It had a futuristic cover, lifted straight from buck rogers  
The record was so black it had to be a con  
The autochanger switched as I filled my sandwich  
And futuristic sounds warbled off and on  
  
The black hit of space  
It's the one without a face  
It's the one that doesn't fit  
You can only see the flip  
The black hit of space  
Sucking in the human race  
How can it stay at the top  
When it's swallowed all the shops  
  
As the song climbed the charts, the others disappeared  
Til there was nothing but it left to buy  
It got to number one, then into minus figures  
Though nobody could understand why  
  
The black hit of space  
It's the one without a face  
It's the one that doesn't fit  
You can only see the flip

Sucking in the human race  
How can it stay at the top  
When it's swallowed all the shops  
  
I couldn't stand this bland sound any more so I walked towards my deck to turn
it off  
All I could see was the b-side of the disc  
Which had assumed a doughnut shape with the label on the outside rim  
I reached for the arm which was less than one micron long  
But weighed more than Saturn and time stood still  
I knew I had to escape but every time I tried to flee, the record was in front
of me

It's the hit that's never gone

Talkin' 'bout the death 'n' glory boys  
When your head is on the scaffold  
'N your ass is on the line  
You gotta give it that old religion  
One mo' time  
Get the death 'n' glory boys  
  
Midnight - no light  
Cool sand - like mud in my hands  
Got this feelin' - in my hair  
What's that movin' - I ain't a scared  
  
It's that same old story  
Freak out with the death 'n' glory boys  
When it's down to stealing apples  
'N you been doin' time  
They can buy the hero in you  
For a dime  
You're a death 'n' glory boy  
  
You'd better pack up your troubles  
In your old kit bag  
Say goodbye to your mother  
She's the only friend you have  
  
Long live the leaders  
Long may they reign  
May they live long enough  
To feel every single pain  
  
They don't care about the widows  
They don't give no reasons why  
They just keep on making medals  
You can buy  
  
From the death 'n' glory boys

All the sons and lovers on her mind

Easy money

She needs someone can she please

A shadow limps across the great sunrise  
And steals the hope that lies behind her eyes

And he's inside you - 'n I am too - so here we are - just the three of you""

out of his mess""

How big's the universe - is time - the same for you as my life is to mine""

you would note  
The size of him and the size of me - and that's how big we both shall be""

And we both sit down - and we play the game - when somebody wins it all starts

Like faith 'n superstition stay - to help you pass the time away  
But when you talk of time and life - it makes me think of circles, heights  
Expansion is the clue - your dreams - are nearer than you've ever been""

Turned to dust and I took flight  
  
For those looks they seemed to say  
You ain't nuthin' - go away  
You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed  
I'm gonna be somebody - someday

When she started dating boys - I nearly died  
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand  
I felt I had to crawl away and hide  
In my mother's living room I composed so many tunes  
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say  
Gonna be somebody - someday  
  
Wild as your name I soon left that country town  
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs  
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud  
It's that face in the crowd - didn't dig it - much too proud...

A barker street bus station non affair  
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad

Somewhere in the night he's calling  
And somewhere in your heart you're falling  
  
I'll forgive you when you stay out late and you never phone  
I'll forgive you even though I'll never understand  
I'll forgive you 'cause you're all I've got and I love you  
But I'll never forgive the other man  
No, I'll never forgive as long as I live  
No, I'll never forgive the other man  
I said I'll never never never forgive  
No, I'll never forgive the other man

Breath is my witness and roads are my life  
Just give my future's clean as a knife  
Far on the way from L.A.  
  
The sun heats the saddle, sand in my hair  
Looking for water and there's sweat everywhere  
Know that I'm nearer I smell damp air  
I ain't tasted coffee for days  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunters hunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider  
  
Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall  
Damned if I can't remember it all  
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall  
I paid for the funeral crew  
And it seems like I never reach Mexico  
They're heading me off every place that I go  
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low  
What else can an outsider do  
  
I know they're near to me, I don't have to see  
Just let me be the outsider  
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind  
They won't find the outsider  
The outsider  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunter's haunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider

As I sit 'n' write these words  
And london's gettin' paler  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
You figured for an evening  
And you made it all worthwile.  
It's seldom people have a job  
And even rarer that I smile.  
  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Play me some, play me some,

Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.  
  
And if your songs be classics,  
Throw them to the hurd.  
Truth is where they came from  
And not this theatre of the absurd.  
Some say you wanted to play for me  
But it's only what you've heard  
That made you want to capture me  
In your theatre of the absurd.  
It was not me, I said myself  
And you must do so, too.  
I hope you have the strength to stay  
When I'll be watchin' you.

But they left a lonely flower.  
  
Oh when I got here back home tonight  
Something within me stirred.  
Oh it must have been a different kind of play  
That touched my theatre of the absurd.  
Now I'll be on my way alone  
But an interesting thing occurred  
See nobody ever shared too much  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
And there I was back in london,  
Thought about history.  
It was just like being in school again  
But I felt something movin' in me.  
Hearin' just a bit of the future,  
Oh it's comin' and it's still blurred  
And that's the only thing worth living for  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
  
Come on,  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Oh play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.

Lost children of the night - come catch the candle bright  
I hear a hollow sound - falling to the ground - she's lost before she's found  
  
Sad broken angels takin' rainbows  
Out on the street for all to see  
If we are the chosen few - what ever happened to  
All those things we knew, if this is being free -  
I'd rather search for me  
  
You nearly did, you nearly did, you nearly did  
You nearly did me in, you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide - my weary anger down  
  
Out on some misty distant highway  
Feel like I though a million miles  
Is my search nearly done - I think I see someone  
I get the urge to run on blindly through the rain,  
and I fool myself again

What ever happened to integrity

Oh I can feel a mood coming down on me  
Such a good thing disappears  
I can sense the loss creeping up on us  
And it's deeper than any tears I've known

In the morning we was gone  
Won't you blow a kiss to me baby  
We both gotta be moving on  
Sometimes you see a lover and she's made for love  
But you let that lover slip by  
You believe and yet she's so hard to get  
And you never know the reasons why  
She stepped into your dreams  
She opened up your door  
She stepped into your dreams  
You want her so much more  
She stepped into your dreams tonight yeah

In another time, in another place  
Things might have turned out okay

Sometimes I get just a little insane  
I can feel emotions like the mighty oceans  
They're driving me again, and I know

And let me tell ya a story or two  
About a punk-ass nigga I knew  
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick  
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick  
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot  
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop  
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe  
At that type of shit he's a pro  
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil' nap  
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps  
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay  
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way  
To make some money, why not?  
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot  
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe  
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew  
For the man that was really important  
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan  
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes  
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes  
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out  
Saw, her and her friends sellin' sheepskins  
  
Yo yo I got them sheepskins  
Yo, my empty sheepskins  
Yo baby, what's up with that?  
  
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock  
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock  
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course  
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs  
Saw a fight over colors, too

Lookin' for, the wolf to kill  
They're fucked up and they want revenge  
Them and Humpty used to be friends  
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor  
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him  
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas  
And Mister Rogers is gettin' mighty jealous  
Of the cash that the pigs were makin'  
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon  
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick  
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits  
They said that the motherfuckin' wolf was next  
So Mister Rogers better watch his step  
So he let the wolf know  
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho  
Cause Cinderella is much too fast  
Before twelve, givin' up ass  
Double barrels all loaded and cocked  
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped  
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em  
Little Boy Blue is up front givin' orders

up there lookin' like Super chicken  
At night I see your light through my bedroom window  
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil  
I can't wait till I hear you say  
""I'm going down mayday mayday."" I'm gonna clown  
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me  
y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi  
military force, but we don't want ya  
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher

My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex  
And let me try the four next  
Now the four I was driving was hotter than july  
looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky  
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom  
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""  
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood  
I think I drove through every single hood  
South Central, Compton and Watts  
Long Beach, bust a you, here come the cops  
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes  
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious  
You know that I'm running  
Shit, I hear it humming  
Fuck, I see it coming  
Is it a bird? Yup  
Is it a plane? No  
I hit me a right on El Segundo  
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala  
Let's see if they would folla  
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another  
met me a baby pitbull and his mother  
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window  
I wish it was my ten-four  
had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third  
'cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird  
  
""Just put his hat, ehrrr,  
he combed his hair and then put his hat back on.  
he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115  
miles an hour, with the police chasing him.  
they're not gonna be  
real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh  
They hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""  
  
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't want to see him  
could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?  
See, I didn't want to gank you  
but don't make me bank you, thank you  
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess  
that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus  
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle  
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""  
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park  
The 735 and I'm bailin'  
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,  
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman  
Looked out the window by the black bed  
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed  
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face  
I close the blinds cause I didn't want to catch a case  
All that night, I heard the bird circle  
while I was eating fish and watching Urkel  
She said I could sleep on the couch  
By two A.M. I was digging her out  
Fuck the ghetto bird  
  
""Which way is he going now?""  
""Ok, now, now he's, he's actually southbound, on a service street  
and, uh, Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure

I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to

Money, and got more nuts for ya honey, so  
Come and break me off, this nigga's walkin' soft,

For you ruff necks, I'll check you with my tool and shit,  
Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore  
Role, we still cool, but just make it smooth  
  
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder  
How I keep from goin' under, I'm chocolate thunder,  
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin  
And I blend with the tracks, see I'm black

Niggas hit me up with the see's and be 's  
But you don't want to fuck wit these  
'cause I'll put 'em on ya  
And we'll have to wake ya motherfuckin' ass up with ammonia  
'cause hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop  
Devoid of pop, and if I drop another smooth hit  
It'll still be hard, 'cause I helped start this shit,  
  
So make it ruff (now make it smooth!)

Creepin', ain't no sleepin', ain't a damn thing changed, I hit hoe after  
Hoe with this laid-back shit.)  
Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit, 'cause it's the  
Predator, I edit her, so nigga watch yo step!

Better duck duck or get your ass stuck stuck!

I can show the waterfalls in Spain and Prague  
To the beach in St. Tropes  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But ain't nothing else like L.A.  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But ain't nothing else like L.A.  
Nothing like L.A.  
  
When they come to L.A. they got the wrong impression  
When they come to L.A. they gotta learn they lesson  
When they come to west coast it's such an obsession  
When they come to play it out I'm just an exception  
When it comes to girl I need your affection  
Every time you walk by you get my inspection  
All you gotta do now is make your selection  
And it won't be hard to win this election

I done been around the world I ain't impress  
I can't wait till we hit L.A.X  
Yea Tokyo is cool and yea I feel the UK  
But can't nothing can fuck with California  
Especially L.A. and I'm feeling the bay  
But ain't nothing like rolling down P.C.H.  
Top down west bound it's all good  
You don't go Hollywood when you're from Hollywood  
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters  
Then head to the Staples Center and hang with the Lakers  
Number six is cool but number twenty four is the champ  
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that

The B.E.T. awards and even the Grammy's  
They always pick L.A. over Miami  
I love Miami I ain't dissing Miami  
But where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy?  
Ain't nothing like Sunset Boulevard  
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard  
We got it all what you thought not at all  
If you sick of this shit than take a Tylenol  
It's just me and my woman verses all of y'all  
And we taking a bow for our curtain call  
The angels are lost they don't wanna be found  
If God is looking for 'em I can show him around

I damn near had to wreck a ho  
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""  
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya  
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot  
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot  
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable  
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table  
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'  
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""  
I don't bang I write the good rhymes  
The whole scenery reminded me of good times  
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut  
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up  
He threw up a set and then he was gone  
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on  
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth  
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt  
She said please excuse my house and all that  
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact  
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white  
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right  
She had another brother that was three years old  
And had a bad case of the runny nose  
He asked me who I was then I had to pause  
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers  
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked  
Only thirteen and already pregnant  
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig  
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids  
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin  
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin  
I heard a knock on the door without the password  
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg  
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""  
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo  
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars  
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar  
The girl I was waiting for came out  
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house  
I got my coat and suddenly  
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome  
And I said to myself once again it's on  
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack  
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back  
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up  
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up  
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take  
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake  
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope  
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case  
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge  
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge  
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin  
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin  
She started draggin and all of a sudden  
We all got tossed in the patty wagon  
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point  
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint  
Now the story you heard has one little object  
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!

My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""  
So he soaked me up like Bounty  
Had to do a week in the county  
A piece of cake it was just like a party  
Cause in the county you know everybody  
No I didn't kill or steal or rob  
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob  
  
If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob  
Watch your step cause the gat is kept  
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo  
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no  
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out  
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out  
Get the picture or bitch  
You'll get the eighty-six  
If she want to try and mix  
Business and pleasure make up your own mind  
You gotta be a hoe on your own time  
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep  
Yo the Mob is still deep  
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit  
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with  
So get the noose ready for the lynching  
Now 235 is what I'm benching  
But nowadays it's still not enough  
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush  
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job  
Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob

We got over two million motherfuckers locked up  
(Let me out this motherfucker) Stop snitchin'  
  
Now how many MC's must get booed  
Before somebody say don't fuck with Cube (you know!)  
I'll strip you nude (butt-ass) in your living room  
Face down, paralyzed from the waist down  
I'm a buckin' clown, but don't fuck around  
Doin' movies now, but I'll lay you down  
South Central style, pull them thangs out  
Don't make a millionaire have to send you there  
You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare  
Nigga run nigga run never get there  
I'ma walk, fuck a bitch when I get there  
Nigga this a marathon, ask Farrakhan  
Fuck the cemetery that I'm buried on (fuck 'em)  
The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on (forever)  
Forever what the fuck are they yellin'?  
""Gangsta Gangsta,"" nigga stop tellin' stop snitchin'

You can have whatever you want  
In the hood, it's do's and don'ts  
So when it get hot in this kitchen  
Stop snitchin', nigga stop snitchin'

Microphone master, super rhyme maker  
Gun blaster, who's the life taker (who?)  
Who the fuck is a lifetime Laker?  
I slap the Maybeline off Tammy Faye Baker  
Who the fuck got more than an acre?  
In Los Angeles I got to have paper  
I'm a nigga, don't talk to my neighbors  
Straight asshole, always up in Vegas (yay yay)  
Lay it out for these niggas to follow  
Get the point, but these points is hollow  
Now this here, is hard to swallow  
But if you do it's like hittin' the lotto  
Little nigga with big bravado  
Hit the throttle niggas hit the bottle  
Can give a fuck if they life is hollow  
Where the fuck was you, when I rocked the Apollo, bitch?  
  
Ay, who put this thing together? Me, that's who  
Who I trust? Who I trust? me, thats who!  
  
Nigga nigga nigga, can't you see  
Somehow your words incarcerate me  
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee  
Lock me up in my prime, Muhammad Ali  
Get out whoop yo' ass like Muhammad Ali  
Rumble in the Jungle, nigga don't play Dumbo  
In the hood nigga known as Columbo  
Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble  
Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it  
Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart  
She say she had the hoe cookin' deep dish  
She say Martha fuckin' cook fish and eat fish  
Westside y'all niggas got to peep this  
That's your weakness, can't keep a secret  
Don't say shit, boy that's basic  
They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship  
Stop snitchin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can have whatever you choose  
But out here, it's don'ts and do's  
So after we finish this mission  
Stop snitchin', nigga stop snitchin'  
  
OK, OK

Got a little problem with the redneck cracker  
Get the polly, whack her, ? is a devil shit-packer

Ice Cube,The Product,/i/ice+cube/the+product_20066698.html,"I was told cause I didn't witness the whole act  
In and out was the movement of the bozack  
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin  
Then the nut came gushin  
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary  
With nothin' but the Lord lookin' over me  
I was white with a tail  
But when I reached the finish line young black male!  
One cell made two and two cells made fo'  
And so on so now I'm a embryo  
Then I got a hunch  
That I'ma be on lock down, for nine months  
Chillin', with my mother to guide me  
And nothin' but a stomach to hide me  
From all that worry and bullshit  
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick  
Cause my time is up and I don't care  
With one big push, I'm outta there  
June 15th, it's just my luck  
In 1969, a nigga is the product  
  
""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,  
And you ain't gon' never be shit!""  
  
I learned how to walk and talk and all that  
They put me in school, but it don't matter  
Cause I'm sittin' in history  
Learnin' bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me  
They try to shape us  
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin' rapist  
So I stopped payin' attention  
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention  
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways  
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's  
A high school dropout  
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out  
But I got tossed, he's the boss  
I'm out of there and mad cause I lost  
Now bein' on my own is a factor  
So I become, the neighborhood jacker  
Gimme your car, run your jewels  
Makin' a livin' robbin' fools  
And if I let my nine rang out  
You know, it'll make your brains hang out  
So what's your fate?  
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?  
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled  
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red  
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck  
Stuck up by the motherfuckin' product  
  
""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job  
If you want to stay in my motherfuckin' house""  
  
""Many young men reject the traditional values  
That are important to their parents.  
Church, school and family  
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.""  
  
Twenty-one now, and paid in full  
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled  
On people back in the day  
Plus, I got a little baby on the way  
So I'm tryin' to go straight  
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date  
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate  
Now I'm on a bus upstate  
  
""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""  
""Sittin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace""  
  
Sent to a concrete hoe-house  
Where all the products go, no doubt  
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven  
Livin' in a five by seven  
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out  
Of seein' young boys gettin' they assholes torn out  
And then he got shanked with a spoon  
And he was 'sposed to get out soon  
Is it my fault, he was caught in production  
Where a young black life means nothin'  
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar  
You say I'm better off in the slammer  
And it's drivin' me batty  
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy  
I'm ashamed, but the fact is  
I wish pops let me off on the mattress  
Or should I just hang from the top bunk  
But that's goin out like a punk  
My life is fucked!  
But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin' product

Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine  
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood  
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers  
Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers  
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff  
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast  
And get away nigga fast  
You ain't gonna have me face down no more  
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more  
To the boys in blue, I got kids too  
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no  
On my way to the store  
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over  
But where oh where is the ticket?  
You got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked  
You don't like the face of the original man  
But you gotta treat me like an individual man  
Talk right and I'll talk right back  
Show some goddamn respect to the black  
Cause I gotta get back to my wife  
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life  
  
Just because you got a badge  
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?  
Cracker please, you can yell freeze  
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees  
You think you can do anything you want to do  
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you  
Shooting up South Central  
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show  
Could have popped you off, one dead cop  
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot  
I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized  
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize  
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot  
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop  
Cause every time you see me sagging  
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon  
Try to play me like a trick  
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick  
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10  
But nowadays you got the black skin  
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice  
But you ain't gonna take my life  
  
You man let's get an understanding  
I know that your job is demanding  
But I only got me one life to live  
You only got about six shots to give  
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip  
So why should we trip?  
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?  
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?  
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw  
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law  
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up  
Never never never gonna sock me up  
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden  
To fuck with a nigga for nothing  
Think about me, a brother that's 23  
I got a son and a J-O-B  
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice

Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew  
We can't enjoy ourselves  
Too busy jealous  
Of each other's wealth  
Commin' up is just in me  
But the Black community is full of envy  
Too much back stabbin'  
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin'  
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood  
Build a store, and sell their goods  
To the county of recips ?  
You know us po niggas, nappy hair and big lips?

Too busy buyin' gold an' Caddilacs  
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'  
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did

We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man  
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo  
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you  
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice  
No Ice Cube, just Vannilla Ice  
And y'all sit and scream and cuss  
But there's no one ta blame, but US  
  
US will always sing the blues  
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes  
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button  
""Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'  
Just like a beast  
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out (peace, black man)  
I beat my wife and children to a pulp  
When I get drunk and smoke dope  
Got a bad heart condition  
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's  
Bet my money on the dice and the horses  
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces  
Go to church but they tease us  
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus  
They used to call me Negro  
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe  
No respect and didn't know it  
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford  
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother  
Held back in life because of my color  
Now this is just a little summary  
Of US, but y'all think it's dumb of me  
To put a mirror to ya face, but trust

Cause I see your homies starting to look  
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks  
And I'm feeling like a baller  
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller  
Now you want to go and scheme  
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team  
So I pick up my money and start walking  
Cause now I let the gat start talking  
Now since ya'll lost you want to go out like a sucker  
Take that motherfucker

Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat  
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?  
Rolling in a fucked up Lincoln  
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking  
Into that leopard interior  
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior  
To his tongue get a dumb bitch sprung  
As she's selling more butt  
Don't even get a cut of the money  
His name is Sonny  
And he know the play  
And hope to god that he don't find a runaway  
That's looking to become a star  
He'll have your ass in and out of every car  
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick  
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked  
You don't like it but you still call him hunk  
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk  
You want to leave but Sonny started talking fast  
And it make you want to go and sell more ass  
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the mack?  
Who's the mack?  
  
It is that fool that want to pump the gas  
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?  
He starts macking and macking and you sucking  
Quick to say I'm down on my luck  
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way  
Then you see his sorry ass the next day  
Are you the one getting played like a sucker?  
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?  
Every day, the story gets better  
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater  
He claims he wants to get something to eat  
But every day you find yourself getting beat  
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways  
'cause he's in a daze  
And almost get his ass hit for the crack  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the mack?  
Who's the Mack?  
  
Is it that nigga in that club asking  
Have you ever been in a hot tub?  
I know the game so I watch it unfold  
When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe  
He's talking shit and you crack a smile  
When he tell you that he can go buck wild  
For a girl like you and make it feel good  
You know it's drama but it sound real good  
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E  
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over  
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover  
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back  
Now ask yourself  
Who's the Mack?  
Macking is the game and everybody's playing  
And as long as you believe what they saying  
Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay  
They are gonna get all the play  
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma  
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a  
Mack in my own right  
When it comes to rhyme and rap  
'cause all I do is kick facts  
Unlike Iceberg Slimm  
And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.  
No, I'm not going out that way  
I'm just a straight up N I double G A  
Next time you get over on a fool  
And you did the shit like real smooth  
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts

What's the date and time it don't matter  
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort  
To make a long story short  
Ran into this girl named Carla  
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala  
She said what's up yeah what's the deal  
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real  
Then I looked down she was fat in the front  
I asked how long, well about seven months  
Oh how time flies when you're having fun  
She said yeah but the damage is done  
Where you been, on a little vacation  
Oh by the way congratulations  
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue  
Then she said the lucky man is you  
I dropped my brew  
And everything looked fuzzy  
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy  
She said yeah remember that date  
I thought back and tried to calculate  
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine  
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times  
She said that day no I wasn't whoring  
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring  
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court  
Paying a gang on child support  
Then I thought deep about giving up the money  
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy  
Naw cause then I'd really get faded  
That's murder one cause it was premeditated  
So what I'm a do  
I don't have a clue  
How many months left damn only two  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
No cigar, G  
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded  
  
It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her  
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her  
See the booty and the front was all in place  
But the girl had the pitbull face  
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid  
Oh lord god forbid  
My homies see me at the motel  
Cause those fools would love to just go tell  
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep  
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept  
And hold your big fat butt steady  
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready  
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey  
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque  
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing  
That I'm a hate myself in the morning  
I got drunk to help me forget  
Yo another day another hit shit  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
Ay yo you know what time it is  
  
Nine months later she's ready to drop the load  
And everybody in the hood already knows  
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me  
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G  
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her  
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger  
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up  
I'm gettin' fed up bitch  
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me  
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me  
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot  
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two  
That night she went into labor  
And the shit is getting kinda major  
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver  
Looking like my next-door neighbor  
She said it was mine that was her best guess  
But let's check the results of the blood test  
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative  
Damn why did I let her live  
After that I should've got the gat  
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap  
But no I just told the hoe who laid me  
Excuse me bitch it's a switch  
You can't fade me  
  
Naw baby not this way  
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger  
I don't fall for the okey-doke  
And before I fall for the okey-doke  
I let the pistol smoke  
Now sing it  
Yeah baby you can't fade me  
Naw unfadable baby

Across the sea as midnight comes, it may not last till daylight comes  
And the trip is long  
And the waves are strong  
But then again, it might be up there forever  
I've heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And if I'm touched by someone's careless hand  
Asleep on the wind  
Our lives might last until the journey's end  
Alive  
Alive  
  
Our lives are just bubbles of time  
They're rainbow-colored and shining in the sun  
They drift above the treetops now  
In danger that the breeze drops somehow  
And darling, that's all it would take  
Yet we threaten not to break  
Then again we could be up here forever  
I've heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And I'm untouched by someone's careless hand  
Asleep on the wind

That when they pull you too far  
You must learn to forgive and ask your heart  
Will I lose a friend  
Striving to contend?  
Will I destroy this trust  
When I want the best for us?  
Should I hold your hand  
No matter what you plan?  
For every hour you need  
I will follow, if you lead  
  
In this home  
There is family and just familiar faces  
In this pilgrimmage  
We disavow our brothers and confide in strangers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you have believed  
That the earth was flat or round?  
Would you have bet you lived before  
Or is this your first time around?  
Do you believe we're here to learn?  
Do you dream in black or white  
Or are you colouring your lost and found  
To make it bright?

Idina Menzel,Fool Out Of Me,/i/idina+menzel/fool+out+of+me_20196353.html,"Hey,  
Just when you think you are the shit  
Well, you look down and your fly is unzipped  
That's when you take a moment to say,  
""Well, sometimes I'm so totally unhip.""  
  
Just when the great ones inspire you  
To throw caution to the wind  
That's when the mirror, mirror on the wall says,  
""Babe, you better throw your towel in.""  
  
[Chorus:]  
All that I don't know  
Paralyzes me  
But somehow I keep going on  
Just settling for this mediocrity  
And I wonder if God is trying to make a fool out of me  
[Repeat]  
  
There are legends who die  
And I've never even heard their songs  
And there are heroes of a generation  
Whose poetry is not on my shelf  
And my soliloquies would make Shakespeare  
Turn over in his grave  
And voyagers would forbid me  
To join in their crusade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wish I could fight against Ali and win  
I wish I could write with Joni Mitchell's pen  
Sail the Atlantic on a paddle boat  
I wish I could smile like Bobby de Niro  
I wish that the lotto was the number of my telephone  
I wish I could sing a duet with Bono  
'Cause I don't want to sound like  
Anyone else, you know  
  
I just want to take you under my spell  
Excuse me for saying  
What I know down deep is my sin  
But maybe I'll fool everybody into thinking  
I know just what I am doing

In your old tighty-whities

And the minuet between the heart and the breath  
Is gonna rock me every time  
And the minuet between the heart and the breath

My movie rental addiction  
They can be antisocial just like us and  
They can choose their very own religion  
They can climb into bed in the  
Middle of the night and  
Sleep in your arms, as if hypnotized

A one hit wonder  
I'm pretty sure we'll be okay

Still feels that way  
From the sandalwood oil  
That you dab in the middle

We'd miss it, a little.

And tried painfully to jump up he wagged his tail nervously  
Since the beginning he hadn't touched his bowl once  
He had lost a lot of weight  
  
I helped him to settle on my lap  
For a few seconds he looked at me  
With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology  
Then, calmed, he closed his eyes  
Two minutes later he gave out his last breath  
  
I buried him beside the residence  
At the western extremity of the land  
Surrounded by the protective fence  
Next to his predecessors  
  
During the night a rapid transport  
From the Central City dropped off an identical dog  
They knew the codes and how to work the barrier  
I didn't have to get up to greet them  
  
A small white and ginger mongrel  
Came toward me wagging its tail  
I gestured to him  
He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me  
  
Love is simple to define  
But it seldom happens in the series of beings  
Through these dogs we pay homage to love  
And to its possibility  
  
What is a dog but a machine for loving  
You introduce him to a human being giving him the mission to love  
And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid this human being might be  
The dog loves him, the dog loves him

Adds a truth to the heart  
And a light to the face  
  
It's good when you don't give as  
Much of a fuck  
As you did when the threats mount  
To make you suck  
A burst of rage  
A lively cry

My death is certain alright  
But death is certain no cure  
'Cause death is certain  
'Cause death is certain so why?  
  
Gotta die  
A bone and a skull  
In a conjugal hell  
A mall full of gall  
And the music jerks off  
Pale and fate  
  
At the table they sat  
With their necks choking tight  
In their collars dead white  
Liquor and food 'till  
They spin and explode  
In a shower of crap  
In America's lap  
A pliceman's numb  
A lazy bum

And your mama's good looking

She's not the colt

She's elegant  
But youth is lost  
Still she has ways to make me talk  
I love you Nazi Girl  
  
Her French is perfect  
So's her butt  
She wears two crosses  
Tangled up  
She's independent  
She's not dumb  
Tough little Nazi Girl  
  
So now I've fucked her on the floor  
Among my books of ancient lore  
And I have made a full report  
About a Nazi Girl

Until day is night  
  
They're gonna push it baby

And they can beat my brain  
With houses and wars and chains  
  
They are insane

They won't pull a fucking plug  
They won't pull a fucking plug  
And give the skies  
Back to the birds and bugs

Although she's dressd up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun

Running around trying everything new

All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions  
They promise to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me

Hearing is believing music is deceiving  
Hard as lightening soft as candlelight  
Dare you trust the music of the night  
  
Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange new world  
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before  
Close your eyes, and let music set you free  
Only then can you belong to me  
  
Floating (floating), falling (falling), sweet intoxication  
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me), savour each sensation

Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight.  
  
Whenever I carry jars of regret  
I stumble over and over again  
The slip breaks me  
And that kills your heart  
When you feel like falling apart  
I'd come running to catch you.  
  
You give me this  
You give me that  
And this kiss is getting wild  
And just maybe, just maybe.  
  
When I get to my room  
I'm still drowning from your stare  
How could I now sleep  
When love is in my hair?  
  
Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight.  
  
Oh you give me so much hope  
All the stars have agreed  
Let my dreams somersault  
Paint your rainbows here.

Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown  
Communication begun thru the incarnated body  
Of the spiritual leader  
Questions are asked, answers correct  
But they don't the real horrors  
Behind the spirit of the dead  
Ceremony is over now  
Relatives left in satisfaction  
Knowing that he's resting in eternal peace  
Days have passed  
Then there was a knocking at the door  
Live in the flesh  
The missing one that they thought was dead  
Memories coming back  
Realizing what they have heard  
Was nothing but a malignant force  
Telling them nothing but lies  
Chorus  
Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown

Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed?

And now we are feeling the effects  
That the forces of nature has brought  
The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions  
It's getting worse than ever before  
We can see the revenge of this planet upon us  
As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air  
Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen  
Causing death rate and we wonder from where  
People are dying in civilizations of different lands  
Because of drought  
Occurrences of flooding everywhere  
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair  
Abomination because people fear that all these events  
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly  
Men subjugate the forces of nature  
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly  
The animals are becoming extinct  
Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste  
Combustible smoke  
Factories are creating acid rains  
That is burning our skins, damaging plantations  
And soon it will us to death  
Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere  
Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth

Won't exist anymore  
Because we won't be able to recreate  
Some of the beauty that we had before  
Nobody seems to care  
About the future of our children's civilizations  
We better act now  
So they won't have a life of torment and frustration  
Stupidity  
Causing pain

He's never left me, and He never will  
  
Verse 2  
On a cross, Jesus died  
For my sins He gave His life  
Stone they rolled o'er His grave  
Crushed the hopes of men that day  
But He rose, praise His Name  
Now I'm free from guilt and shame  
Because He loves me, and I love Him too  
  
Verse 3  
Trials I've had, battles I've fought  
But through Your Word, Lord, You have taught  
If I don't go left, don't go right  
If I just stand, I'll win this fight  
The battle's not mine but the Lord's  
He will be my shield and sword

You got to ask a Tuesday's child  
And we're back together again  
And I'm never gonna lose you as a friend

Thinking crazy thoughts like it was going to set me free

Indigo Girls,Birthday Song,/i/indigo+girls/birthday+song_20983267.html,"I couldn't think of a thing to write  
On your birthday card  
Considered the poets  
But they didn't know what  
Lay quite inside my heart  
I thought of Atlanta  
I thought of Toronoto  
And all of the places we've been  
I filled up my tea and looked into the trees  
And still came up empty again  
So I guess the next time you see me  
In a world of partial truths  
You will fully believe me  
I have nothing to give except but to live  
Like the person you know me to be  
I can clean up the kitchen  
And fold up your clothes  
Neatley as I am able  
Wrap a box up with ties for a surprise  
And order you flowers for the table  
I could book us a trip  
On a plane or ship  
I know how much you love the sun  
You could gamble on me  
Like the lottery  
And I'll make you feel like you've won  
And I'll bet the next time you see me  
In a world of partial truths  
You will fully believe me  
I have nothing to give except but to live  
Like the person you know me to be  
Life is short and so on  
I'd like to give you something to go on  
Grow on  
They recently paved the walk on our street  
We looked at the shiny cement  
We stopped the car ready to carve  
Our names into permanence  
For a moment we're kids  
Intent on a whim  
There is no shadowy past  
But even so the urge is to go  
And put something down  
That will last  
So here goes  
The next time I show up for you  
You will know  
And believe  
I am ready to give  
Ready to live  
Like the person you know me to be.

Will you get better  
Then will you leave us?  
How you mixed with the darkness  
At such a young age  
Until in your chemistry

Silence to rage

One shoe off and a bridge to cross over  
And where is your taxi fare,  
Are you left by yourself or left by your lover?  
For three nights straight now I dream I keep both of my shoes  
But I've forgotten my lines  
And I've misplaced my cues  
And there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,  
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from  
  
There were the secrets  
The big bang and the bigger joke

And injustice makes you red with choke  
You love like your desperate  
You don't know what love is

One thing I could give you,  
Maybe it was this

The anguished repeat  
The sweat of our sadness  
The twist of the sheets

Where will I be when you've found it?  
I pray a lot about these bad feelings inside  
But I can't pray my way through or around it

You headed back down that track.

Her cup and the embers of a dying fire glow.

Touch you know I'll miss you so much and I hope we get out  
Of this town.

Playing your story in fists ans starts. You take your prospects  
And your pick axe and you trudge down to the stream.  
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream.

easier. You learn how to breathe or you lern how to grieve the past.  
You study the masters and their books giving in to the barbs and hooks.  
Till you execpt it with grace when your true love doesn't last.

Indigo Girls,Fare Thee Well,/i/indigo+girls/fare+thee+well_20067355.html,"Fare thee well my bright star  
I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness  
But you were long gone before I ever got to you  
Before you blazed past this address  
  
And now I think of having loved and having lost  
But never know what it feels like to never love  
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost  
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes  
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day  
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise  
  
Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings  
For a cool evening I began to yearn  
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire  
Waiting to see if I would burn  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive  
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life  
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive  
  
And I caught you then in your moment of glory  
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage  
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me  
My once in a lifetime star of an age  
  
So fare thee well my bright star  
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around  
And this strange season of pain will come to pass  
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down

I was gambling away my last dime  
Well I pulled down the lever  
And I sent up a prayer  
That my luck would not be denied

Roll out the head of Faye Tucker  
And never you mind what they say  
You may be reborn but it's all just for scorn  
And that's what you'll take to the grave  
That's what you'll take to the grave  
  
Well the minister wants you to live now  
And the governor wants you to fry  
And whatever it was that you thought might occur  
They got something else in their minds  
  
The got something else in their minds  
  
If you live they gonna make you a campaigner  
If you die they gonna make you a grave  
Either way it goes down  
Well your life's not your own  
  
And that's why killin' don't pay  
That's why killin' don't pay  
  
I thought I heard the angel's bells  
But they were just the hounds of hell  
  
What did you learn Faye Tucker  
What will take from this world  
  
Well mercy could prove us  
But nothing would move us  
  
To rise above just being cruel  
To rise above just being cruel

Indigo Girls,Feed And Water The Horses,/i/indigo+girls/feed+and+water+the+horses_20983268.html,"Tell me dark heart of my deep sleep  
Where the past drops in like unwanted guests  
Rattling their chains of thought, shuffling their feet  
Peering into things I thought I'd laid to rest  
And for all I've left undone there's another dream to come  
  
Once there were wars fought over spice and salt  
And the stick of gold became the standard measure  
Nothing much has changed in this modern age  
And it won't until the pain's not worth the pleasure  
  
And for all we've left undone  
There's another war to come.

Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you, we'll come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses  
Where they lie.  
  
I miss the smell of ink on paper and it's morning pull  
All the news comes via link now all so virtual  
I don't know what to think  
I don't know what to feel  
The beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel  
  
And for all we've left undone  
We are still evolution

I realize that the beast lie there in our plans  
Peacefully sleeping, but faithfully keeping  
They're ready for the burden man  
  
But if you knew something (peacefully sleeping)  
They'd take you to something (faithfully keeping)  
You are dying for your burden man (they're ready for the burden man)  
  
Wouldn't you need it? (Wouldn't you need it?)  
Wouldn't you feed it? (Wouldn't you feed it?)  
Wouldn't you praise it evermore?

Lost my something and I can't get it back  
Or a kill on your trophy rack  
I checked my schedule now my train is rolling down a track  
Past the sadness of the salt flats  
To the prospect of the land fat  
Or just a lazy orange house cat  
On the sofa where I'll be put up  
You've been the hole in my sky, my shrinking water supply  
Before my well runs dry  
I'm going round round round the bend  
Fill it up again  
  
I'd like to say that it was clear to me  
Love triangle geometry  
But in the end it's still a mystery  
The placement of affection and the disarray  
I gathered up the courage that it took  
Made that bed and took one last look  
And you could hear the pages flapping in the wind blown  
Book of my days, my days  
One tank gone second thoughts are on my mind  
What's this trip gonna cost me this time  
The devil I know is starting to look awfully kind  
But the new road is an old friend  
I fill it up again

In other lands are beating  
With hopes and dreams  
As true and high as mine  
  
My countries skies

On clover leaf and pine

Indigo Girls,Fleet Of Hope,/i/indigo+girls/fleet+of+hope_20789925.html,"The fisherman comes up  
Puts his two poles in the sand  
He stares out at the sea  
Just exactly like me  
But I've got a book in my hand  
We will have caught on to something by the end of the day  
But mostly we think about the one that got away.  
  
I've seen like a bird  
What pleasures the surface can bring  
I've lost my best craft  
Going foolishly back  
To where to Sirens sing  
I've stared up at the place where the water meets the sky  
And though I stopped breathing I still believe I should try  
Maybe a boat in search of lost treasures will pass by.  
  
'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When she's shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day.  
  
I've walked through the desert  
Climbed over mountains so high  
Through jungles and plains  
I took buses and trains  
And airplanes across the sky  
But none as seductive as ocean before me alone  
And now I know why  
You layered your pockets with stones.  
  
'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When she's shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day.  
  
When I was a girl  
All of my fancy took flight  
And I had this dream  
Could outshine anything  
Even the darkest night  
Now I wait like a widow for someone to come back from sea  
I've always known  
I was waiting for me  
  
'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When she's shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day.

Now one of us is changing  
Or maybe weve just stopped trying  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
No  
  
It used to be so easy living here with you  
You were light and breezy I knew just what to do  
But now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
No  
  
Therell be good times again for me and you  
But we just can't stay together don't you see that its true  
Still I'm glad for what we had  
And how I once loved you  
  
But its too late baby, now its too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
Its too late baby  
Its too late now darling  
Its too late

Lately waking up I'm not sure where I've been  
There was a table set for six and five were there  
I stood outside and kept my eyes upon that empty chair  
And there was steam on the windows from the kitchen  
Laughter like a language I once spoke with ease  
But I'm made mute by the virtue of decision  
And I choose most of your life goes on without me  
Oh the fear I've known  
That I might reap the praise of strangers  
And end up on my own  
All I've sown was a song  
But maybe I was wrong  
  
I said to you the one gift which I'd adore  
The package of the next 10 years unfolding  
But you told me if I had my way I'd be bored  
Right then I knew I loved you best born of your scolding  
When we last talked we were lying on our backs  
Looking at the sky through the ceiling  
I used to lie like that alone out on the driveway  
Trying to read the Greek upon the stars  
The alphabet of feeling  
Oh I knew back then  
It was a calling that said if joy then pain  
The sound of the voice these years later  
Is still the same  
  
I am alone in a hotel room tonight  
I squeeze the sky out but there's not a star appears  
Begin my studies with this paper and this pencil  
And I'm working through the grammar of my fears  
Oh mercy what I won't give  
To have the things that mean the most  
Not to mean the things I miss  
Unforgiving the choice still is  
The language or the kiss

The absent sound of another day as it recedes  
Into the shadows  
Until it's nothing  
  
Fax papers slipped under the hotel room door  
Like food for the prisoner or the prospect to the whore  
Well fed and halfway drunk I ache myself for more  
Until I'm shadows of myself  
Until I'm nothing  
  
Sixteen black churches burning on the tv  
All the way from Texas to Tennessee  
And a politician locks my eye and says to me  
There is no crisis here  
There's no conspiracy  
  
I crave inertia every move made so I can stop  
Whatever this madness is in me spinning like a top  
On a bed of anxiety over a deep dark drop  
Down into nothingness  
Into without-you-ness  
  
Was it ever so the evil creep like ivy  
A toe hold on the stronger half of nature's dichotomy  
I'm beating back a path through nothing more than pure insistence  
Until here becomes  
The distance  
  
Hold my head love I'm sick tonight  
Find the open hole and press your fingers there with all your might  
Before the last ounce of my spirit bleeds  
Onto the pristine sheets  
Of the hotel bed in Leeds

With affected conversation trying to pry inside your mind  
You are as beautiful as truth and empty as a shell  
And I came to you one night and it made me feel like hell  
  
Oh, to reach through all your surface  
Just to find an empty pool  
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side  
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool

Antithesis of everything inside theirselves they hate  
But you'd better close your eyes when it's time for them to die  
Cause you'd hate to think the life we built upon them was a lie  
  
Oh, to reach through all your surface

And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side

No one ever has to know who the hero took for lover  
But it comes to mind as you blaze on as brilliant as a star  
How many you've left behind, how many casualties there are

So the darker the ages get  
There's a stronger beacon yet

In the turn of the cheek

In the face of your fear

Is their only power  
When we stand like spotlights  
In a mighty tower  
All for one and one for all

Not content to blow and bend

Eating us away, eating us away  
Eating us away to our extinction  
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me  
I'd still have two of the same to live  
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal  
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift we could give  
Tell all the friends who think they're so together  
That these are ghosts and mirages, these thoughts of fairer weather

Were a generation running out of time  
There's a bomb, there's a man  
There's a gun in his hand yeah  
Nobody smiles at strangers were scared from birth  
Afraid the mans gonna take us for all that were worth  
Strip us of our pride  
Make a strike from inside  
Come on and tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Even lovers have trouble at hand  
What's your preference where do you stand  
You get all uptight about it  
Wanna fight about it  
Wanna fight about love  
No no no  
Wanting independence separate but equal  
A lover here another there  
One more for the sequel to the heartache  
How much more can we take  
Wont you tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Now Im talking about  
Altruism and unification  
We forgotten what that means  
Cynicism in this mighty nation  
And hatred is spitting us right at the seams  
  
Oh but I still believe that good will prevail  
And if we don't ever try  
Its damn sure that well fail  
Lose another day  
The american way  
So come all believers  
Come all races  
Start looking at the souls  
Not at the faces  
And were there  
And were learning to care  
I want to know baby  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family

We get together periodically and  
I got a bad case I can't shake off of me  
The fevered wanderin round wondering how it ought to be  
You work in the system  
You see possibilities and you're glistening  
Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em  
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman  
I dream like a mad one  
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can  
I'm a psychic and a laywoman  
I see love and I like to make it happen  
What we get from your war walk  
The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock  
I want the pendulum to swing again  
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind  
It doesn't come by the bullwhip  
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips  
It's not the company of gunslingers  
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger  
She is she is she is  
It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit  
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit  
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it  
Too hard just to go by a blind faith  
But they left out the sisters  
I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her  
The goddess of benevolence  
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left  
Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress  
Relegated by the Vatican  
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again  
If we're a drop in the bucket  
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it  
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light  
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right

See the water lap along the shore line  
The buried forest of a man made lake  
Cemeteries are laying underneath it  
Your heart like a dam when it breaks.  
  
We are floating, we are swimming  
And in this moment we are forgetting  
What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way.  
I'm okay, if I don't look a little closer  
I am driving with the tank full  
I'm OK if I don't see beyond the shore  
The sun is blistering this black top road.  
I'm OK if I don't have to do the killing  
We are talking, cellular and mobile  
OK know what the killing is for.  
As if its some kind of cure for this world of woe  
  
We are talking, we are driving  
And in this moment we are denying  
What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
It's one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
Its one perfect world  
  
If you can't see beyond the myth of isolation  
And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore,  
Connect the points and see the constellations  
As the night comes down on the reservoir.  
  
We are swimming, we are floating  
And in this moment we are beholden to  
What it costs, and what it takes  
For one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
It's one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
Its one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another world?

And your hand's upon my knee

Chase all the ghosts from your head

Smarter than the tricks played on your heart

I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road that fancy and fast ends  
Ends in a fatal crash

Something new instead of something old  
(But keep the old)  
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
(But remember what is gold)  
And it's fools gold  
(What is gold)  
Fools gold

And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse

Now the steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
The closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free

Its not me and its not you  
There was one more time when I should have said I love you  
One more time when I should have told you I care  
When we sit here in silence  
And we miss the ones we love that cant be here  
Its the love we leave behind  
  
I tried to lose this restless spirit in a mission of regrets  
But I cant survive without this war  
And your eyes reflect the visions that I cant forget  
I find balance on a darkened highway  
I find truth by the side of the road  
And someone elses tune to lift me high above the line  
That leaves me running from the cold  
Running from the cold  
Running from the cold

Through the thunder I could hear you scream,  
Solid to the air I breathe,  
Open-eyed and fast asleep.  
Falling softly as the rain,  
No footsteps ringing in your ears.  
Ragged down worn to the skin  
Warrior raging, have no fear.  
  
Secure yourself to heaven.  
Hold on tight, the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens,  
You have just begun.  
  
Kneeling down with broken prayers,  
Hearts and bones from days of youth,  
Restless with an angel's wing,  
I dig a grave to bury you.  
No feet to fall,  
You need no ground,  
Allowed to glide right through the sun,  
Released from circles guarded tight,  
Now we all are chosen ones.  
  
Secure yourself to heaven.  
Hold on tight, the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens,  
You have just begun.

I say let's put on some tunes sing along do little all day  
Go sown to the riverside take off our shoes wash these sins away  
  
The river said la la la  
Shame on you  
  
I go down to Chicano city park because it makes me feel so fine  
When the weeds go down you can see up close in the dead of the winter time  
But when the summer comes everything's in bloom and you wouldn't know it's
there  
The white folks like to pretend it's not but their music's in the air  
  
You can hear them singing la la la  
Shame on you  
  
You can feel them dancing la la la  
Shame on you  
  
My friend Tanner she says you know me and Jesus we're of the same heart  
The only thing that keeps us distant is that I keep fuckin' up  
I said come on down to Chicano city park wash your blues away  
The beautiful ladies walk on by  
You know I never know what to say  
  
They'll be singing ooh la la  
Shame on you  
  
Let's go road block trippin' in the  
Middle of the night up in Gainesville town  
There'll be blue lights flashing down the long dirt road  
When they ask me to step out  
They say we be looking for illegal immigrants can we check your car  
I say you know it's funny I think we were on the same boat back in 1694

Somebody lit a cigarette

Backbreaking pickers in the patches  
Everythings burning down to ashes  
And down to the ground  
She's saving me

I try to put it aside  
But it's too much bigger than me  
There's a big brown hawk in the tree  
Lighting and leaving  
And there's tea leaves tossing  
Heads up pennies in my pocket  
Dead star like a rocket  
The arc of my grieving  
She's saving me

Then days so still the beauty gives you pain  
The heatwave kills the green  
And she remains unseen  
But colors up my dreams  
With all things blooming  
  
This is not all there is  
It's not a kingdom  
It's not an angry god  
It feels like her  
It feels like no fear  
It feels like no doubt  
It feels like inside out

And I hunger for your laugh  
Do the craziest things like look around  
When I know youre nowhere near me

From a song I haven't finished since last summer  
Cause I never could decide how much was gin  
How much the sea  
Or other incidentals clouding what was really me  
  
Everything I am is bare feet and burning sand  
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the sea  
  
A madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect  
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort me

Lord knows I've tried  
  
I might let it go and take a long long run  
Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun  
Then again I might just make big plans  
And leave them on the table

And the words I am unable  
I will always be unable to express

To lay his heart on the bathroom rug  
He drank his coffee in the same old mug  
And sat in silence 'til the world fell numb  
  
Until the day when a girl came by  
She had eyes like the rising tide  
He felt a sharpness deep inside  
The kind of ache that can't be satisfied  
  
We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes  
But how we love when it washes our cars  
We love to love when it fills up the room  
But when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars

And he went to a picture show  
Tried to find someone else who knows  
All the hurt that a heart can hold  
  
She smelled like cinnamon and winter clove  
And sparked like firewood inside a stove  
Wanted to ask her just to sit and stay  
Instead he watched as she walked away

But how we love when it washes our cars  
We love to love when it fills up the room

Nu conteaza cat de lung e drumul  
Spre o alta viata!

Stateam fata-n fata amandoua,  
In oglinda, si-mi spunea  
Ca viseaza la o lume mult mai mare ca ea

Ochii, parul, toate trasaturile ei le-aveam  
Era prima data cand ma privea.

The red of blood I seen it come in 25 shades  
Just your ordinary average homicide days  
Long ago a homie told me, yo that crime pays  
No I'm in the hot pursuit, I'm riding sideways  
I know my life ain't worth the bullets in your '45  
But you ain't hitting me, I jump into a sporty dive  
Before you know I got my shank inside your throat and sides  
24's on 84 Regal as you was flooring right  
Pilling, chrome creeping, through the ghetto zone  
9 milli-milli bang for the metal tome  
Send you back to your mama wrapped in cello-phone  
You seen the lights of the flashy berretta chrome  
Slice your ass with this hatchet like we Tom and Jerry  
Knock your shit out, get you paid by the tooth fairy  
When you die you're getting wet up like your bloody Carrie  
Tuck your ass nice and cozy for the cemetery  
When I burry your ass

Money to my mamma, I'm sending that  
Corners full of drama I'm bending that  
24's on a 84 Regal, and I'm grinding

I'm fixing to save the underground like Neo. People  
People, there's no equal  
Fuck the sequel  
This is it  
A hit is a hit  
You're about to get your wig split  
It's the real deal no counterfeit  
Nigga's check my style, my paint jobs gleaming  
My rims is beaming  
My hoes swallow my seamen  
Oops I was just peeing  
Let me re-start fuck going to court  
Live in the fast lane cause life is to short  
Hoes quote my rhymes  
Fiends cop my dimes  
My shit is so clean  
I only ride when the sun shines  
Read between the lines  
Fucking with mine you lose your mind  
And I ain't lying, nigga's is dying

Grip the stearing wheel tight bitch I ain't crashing it  
Barry's in the rearview what the fuck?  
Again? Push him out the window pealed out on his head  
I ain't scared, fuck what he talking  
Talking about my Regal, illegal cause flawsing  
So it's back to the land to get my dime bags  
Not to mention my hatchet to deal with these fags  
I'm back in my home turf, Southwest  
Where the hoes got they man's name tatted on they chest

Twenty-fours on a eighty-four

I had a brain, but life had to ruin it  
Dissinfected, Disected, Don't Respect It  
When you put me in a cage full of animals  
Savages and cold blooded canibals  
I can't help but come but abouts me  
try to run but they found me, surround me  
Then they choke ya, and provoke ya  
try to smoke ya, turn you into a joka  
I tried to rub it off, but its all I know  
the only thing I ever knew, so what to do  
look at you, a bigot till your growin old  
your growin mold, with a soul that's freezin cold  
so I confess, but even if I'm all wrong  
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone  
Chorus  
I confess, this lady had a purse, so I took it  
I took it home, opened it, I shook it  
she had papers, lipstick and nail polish  
credit cards and about 27 dollars  
I bought a 5th, drank it and laid there  
it seemed like, I could see the purse everywhere  
on the light post, by this mail box  
I tried to run from it, I ran a couple blocks  
but there it was, on the side walk, waitin for me  
it tried to lure me to it, I had to fuckin' do it  
I picked it up, and stuck my fuckin' hand in it  
it was full of rats, and they fuckin' bit it off  
father I confess, I'm a criminal  
but my worlds too subliminal around me  
look at them, all the wicked masses  
that's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes

Insane Clown Posse,Cotton Candy,/i/insane+clown+posse/cotton+candy_20067711.html,"(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
My name is Shaggy  
But some call me Shaggy Balls  
'cause you can me my ball sac  
Hangin out my drawls  
I wear short shorts  
Bitches stop and stare  
Later on you see me partin through the Cotton hair  
I meet a bitch  
I always gotta check and ask  
""How many corndogs been to the Cotton patch?""  
And when I fuck bitches ask what i'm tryin to do  
My nuts is people so i try and stuff em in there too  
Cotton Candy is wasn't made for the mouth  
Don't believe me just take a look down South  
Rottin Candy is what you'll find with out a doubt  
I stick my wang in the Cotton hole and then I'm out  
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, nad Nate the Mack  
They huntin Cotton  
And Shaggy Shaggs knows where it's at  
So don't be stingy  
There's more than one Wicked Clown  
And bitch you got enough Cotton here to go around  
Now some bitches want to go and shave they Cotton off  
Straight to the Candy  
I'm wit it  
I won't get lost  
That's why I bring da clippers wit me  
They comin in handy  
When you fuckin round wit the Cotton Candy  
(Chorus) x2  
HHHHHHEEEEEEYYYYY Cotton Candy  
Yeah Hey Hey  
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in yo mouth she told me  
(Violent J)  
My name is J  
The kids call me Jiggy pants  
'cause I can play the flute  
And make my dick start ta dance  
Like a snake I make it shake, rattle, and roll  
And this year my balls made it to the Cotton Bowl  
Unlike Shaggy  
He scared of the Cotton Pie  
I ate so much Cotton Candy  
I got pink eye  
I can remember the first time I had a taste  
She pulled her panties down  
And shoved her Cotton in my face  
I said ""Your daddy's home""  
She said ""So fuckin what""  
I tried to take my ding-a-ling and stick it in her butt  
I tried to push it in  
I couldn't turn it out  
She said ""Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in yo mouth""  
OH SHIT!  
So what was I ta do  
Run like a bitch  
Or have the Cotton Stew  
I thought for a moment  
Then I said ""What The Fuck!""  
I ate so much Cotton that my tongue came out her butt  
BBBBWWWW Bitch  
I'll have another bowl  
My boys had to come and get me  
'cause I lost control  
On the way home I had a new attitude  
I'm like  
""Hey let's go eat some more pussy dude""  
(repeat chorus)

I walked into the church, dressed up as an altar boy  
I seen a preacha, he said ""little boy I'mma teach ya""  
Put his hand up on my shoulder, felt the claw of the beast  
I never thought it'd be so fuckin' easy murderin' a priest  
We went into the confession booth, he took off his clothes  
And cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose  
I jammed a butcher's knife, 12 inches into his gut  
He looked me right into my eyes while I was yankin' it up  
Preacha killas.  
[Hook]  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)  
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)  
Crooked preacha killas  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I walked into the sermen, strapped with an iron crowbar  
I beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunk of my car  
How the fuck she got fake titties and a pussy ring? bullshit!  
She sucked the preacher dick in the pulpit  
I know the goin's-on, I've witnessed it while pushin' my mop  
And blood gushin' no stop when my hatchet go chop  
I ain't no fuckin' holy rolla, I'm outta controlla  
Face painted, fuckin' preacha killas gone off that yola.  
[Hook]  
Crooked preacha killas (cola!)  
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)  
Crooked preacha killas  
[Verse - Violent J]  
We shootin' for the preacha, fuck I missed and hit the reverend  
But it doesn't matter though, they say he's goin' to Heaven  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
And then I for the preacha, I blew his ear off  
We in the balcony bustin', gone off PCP and Smirnoff  
[Violent J]  
Shot again, I missed and hit somebody in the choir  
They fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I shot again, I finally caught the preacha in his dome  
[Both]  
Then we put our barrels to each other's heads and took it hoome.  
[Hook]  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)  
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)  
Crooked preacha killas (leave the fuckin' kids alone!)  
Crooked preacha killas (faggots!)  
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)  
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)

Insane Clown Posse,Crop Circles,/i/insane+clown+posse/crop+circles_20383423.html,"The sun rises and sets on time every day of the year  
But sporadically the circles appear  
Baffling all through the history of known man  
Since fuckin' with the mystery of stone hedge  
Aliens, cults, witches with lawn mowers, mind blowers  
Nobody knows what for sure  
Bloody nose when I walk in the vicinity  
But I can read them and I believe that I need them  
I'm runnin' through a wheat field, chasin' a ghost that loves circles  
Use it for portals and time holes  
And dance backwards, and chant with the crow people  
At the crop circle, I've come to know people  
Under moon rays lighten up my new ways ?  
They mow them in two days, 100 years from now we'll pay for that mishap  
With another motherfucking hurricane bitch slapped  
  
[Chorus]  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something

Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
  
This ball of mud that we live on is alive  
You try to wipe its mouth, it's gonna wipe us out  
I lay in a field alone in the middle of the night  
Try to get my life right, pray for bright lights  
Set flames to the wheat rows during an eclipse  
And the spirits will come out, dance, catch you a glimpse  
They're like artists, connecting the stars in rare fashion  
Intricately placed with secrets of white magic  
I'm running through the moon lit fields  
Following a little orb light hoping it might reveal any secret  
Its dancing, and I can't catch up  
And I almost ran head first into a truck  
No compass will work, and I'm lookin' for answers  
Why the sands of my hour glass fall off backwards?  
Have I lost you, cause I've lost me too  
But if you're hiding in the crops I will come find you  
  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
Something solely meant just for me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
  
40,000 years ago, the stoning of a young man  
His story written in the crops near Spokane  
In England the face of a dead woman shown  
Etched out a wheat field uniquely woven  
  
Hieroglyphics, mathematical genius, predicting the orbital patterns of Venus  
In the grass behind your grandpas wood barn  
Complex designs drops seconds before dawn  
  
Dead birds, scattered throughout the patterns of art  
No explanation left by the shadows of dark  
Batteries drained of they power in seconds  
I'm layin' in the crop circle countin' my blessings  
  
And my heart, tho?, headaches, and nausea were creeping  
And your nose will bleed while you're sleepin'  
  
Don't go near there, don't dare, be ware  
Unless your like us, and don't care

Insane Clown Posse,Dead Body Man,/i/insane+clown+posse/dead+body+man_10144908.html,"""This is a Channel 7 news brief because the news is happening now!  
Good evening Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and  
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four
dead bodies from the  
Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief
entered  
through the basement window but how they eluded the security and alarm system
is still a  
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would
steal four  
dead bodies anyway? Details at 11.""  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street.  
55-65, bodies at least.  
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn.  
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn.  
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven.  
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'.  
Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried.  
I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied.  
I just ate my first dead body last week,  
Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth.  
Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name,  
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane.  
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall.  
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall.  
I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck.  
And my mother's like, ""What the fuck?!""  
He said I was born of an alien race.  
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face.  
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand.  
I'm just a dead body man.  
  
""We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females,  
hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies!  
WOO!""  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van.  
All the little kiddies love the dead body man.  
I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell.  
Some people run cause they don't like the smell.  
Others line up just as quick as they can.  
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man.  
It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh.....  
Just don't look in the trunk.  
I drive down central kickin' the bass.  
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face.  
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head.  
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead.  
I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut.  
A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut.  
Riding in the back is my dead body crew.  
Only they can never think of nothin' to do.  
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself.  
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf.  
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand.  
I'm just the dead body man.  
  
""We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people,  
or you yourself are planning on dying soon,  
we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!  
We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!""

Call me the dead body man (Just sell 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (You can mail 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (But, Bring 'em to me!)

and then he got the lawnmower, and then he.....""  
Dick or treat, bon appetit  
All the little kiddies running down my street  
Gathering candy treats door to door  
But they walk past mine, what for?  
Probably 'cause the pumpkins on my porch are real  
Real human heads carved out with steel  
Cut out the eyes, man, it takes but a minute  
Rip out the be -be -be -be -brains and put a candle in it  
Maybe they run 'cause I take 'em inside  
Come and meet Mother, two years ago she died  
Little boys laugh, 'cause they think it's just a dummy  
But then the smell hits 'em, MMMMM..... smells yummy  
Open your bags and I'll give you my treat  
Crusty yellow toes off a dead woman's feet  
Take me by the hand, and I'll lead you downstairs  
And that, little chickies, is where you'll spend the next seven years  
Starving and weakening, chained to a wall  
Staring at a roach, hoping it will crawl  
Into your mouth for a tasty cuisine

Well, I love all the kiddies, but I can't fuck around  
Don't come to my door dressed as a clown  
'cause you never know, I might take it the wrong way  
'cause I'm the real wicked juggalokaro Violent J  
All year 'round, but I love my Halloween  
You'll never get an apple or a purple jelly bean  
Dropping some chocolates, a licorice snack  
Instead you get a deep-fried French poodle nutsack  
Peeking out my door, I see no children in sight  
Perhaps they're all dead, yesterday was Devil's Night  
They burn down the city and they leave it crispy-charred  
I light myself on fire and I dance around my backyard  
Hungry bellies, I can see where you're at  
Sitting on my window, I can turn into a bat  
Watching you remove all your little clothesies for bed  
I crash through the window and land on your head  
Drinking the blood, blood is gone to the bone  
But now, I must leave, Mother's calling me home  
Up to the moonlight, I'm gone from the scene  
Peace to Detroit City and have a Dead Pumpkins Halloween  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
""Yeeeeeeeeah, I'm gonna smash your little candy bags,  
only I'm gonna tie 'em around your muthafuckin' necks  
and choke you with 'em Wicked Clown style, muthafucka!!!!!""

It's Friday night, dark, scary  
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery  
And its foggy, cold and smoggy  
Hear a dog, a howling doggy  
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun  
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one  
So I watch my back, and what's that  
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback  
Better run, hide, quick, fast  
He's coming for my ass with a shovel  
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit  
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit  
Took a fall, deeper than six foot  
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door  
Into a whole new world of stiffs  
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks  
Club lights, sounds, bass  
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face  
And what I saw next then really took me  
Uh, they did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Hey yo, I heard that you died  
Fuck that, it's time to get live  
Dead bodies let's all take a ride  
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)  
""Oh yeah, we dug up the finest  
Bitches in the graveyard  
So come on down  
And if you ain't come to get your funk out  
Then get the fuck out, bitch""

They all stand straight and swing to the side  
No heads, but they feet still glide  
Take a step back, twist and dive  
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)  
No heads, but they all funky  
And drunk, drinking old Spunky  
Don't be shy, everyone's able  
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table  
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off  
If you're dead, your legs might fall off  
The whole time I can't believe  
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave  
I'm kicking into a freak with no head  
No face, but the rest is straight  
She's with it, I hit it like a G  
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me  
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein  
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine  
Dead stiffs coming through the door  
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor  
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up  
I want to be the headless clown  
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw  
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie

You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos  
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off

If I was a Serial Killer  
They would find all my victim's heads  
In funky ass gas station toilets  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would be strange and deranged  
And I would never change  
If I was a Serial Killer  
I'd be known as the smoker  
Cause I'd cut off and smoke all they hair  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would sleep on broken glass and thumbtacks  
And I would smoke mad crack  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
First thing I would do is kill a couple hotties  
They'd always get some mustard up decapitated bodies  
Dumped on State police law just before dawn  
To let em know my ritual had begun  
I'd crack a 40 with the devil tell him dig me a hole  
Cause I'm coming when I die until them I'm in control  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I ain't  
But if I was I'd do my walls all blood red with blood paint  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I ain't  
But if I was I'd never stop cause I know I can't  
(Violent J)  
If I was a Serial Killer  
I would drive a black van  
And I would ride around on college campus  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would walk among us and gain trust  
Until I needed that rush  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
I'd park outside these bitches homes and then drive away  
Then come back with my lights off this time I'm here to stay  
I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies  
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis  
You know what's all up in my trunk  
So don't ask me to pop it  
Once I get out to my cabin  
Then I'll finally unlock it  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not  
But if I was I'd snap a photo once they died on the spot  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not  
But if I was I'd know that I can't so I would never stop  
(Violent J)  
And I don't know myself anymore  
(and I don't know who I am anymore)  
And I don't know who to be anymore  
(and I don't know who I am anymore)  
And I don't know what to think anymore  
(and I don't know who I am anymore)  
Except that I am strange and deranged

And I will never change

And this gutter is who I am  
Take me back home to my gutter  
And I swear I won't ever leave again!

Hey, I'm coming home  
Home to the criminals and crooks  
Home to the gangbangers shooting dirty looks  
Home to the killer cops beating on my ass  
Home to my '72 Velarick, praying it will last  
Pass by the rich bitches trying to play me out  
Dawging on my neighborhood, don't know what it's about  
So now I'm clockin dunkets, never hang out with the rich  
I'd rather hang out with the crooked at the party store, bitch  
Give me codey, dawg, with a little smog  
'cause it tastes better than the poisonous fog  
Seeping from the sewers in my slummy neighborhood  
But the ghetto got love and the love is all good  
So I don't give a fuck about your mansion by the lake  
You can suck my dingaling until your neck breaks  
'cause all I want to do is hang with the zombie  
In the zone, break out with the Faygo, I'm coming home

Home to the creatures, home to the crooks  
Home to the fools readin witchcraft books  
Home to the monsters roaming the land  
I want to come home but ya don't understand

Jokers and freaks, and their dead body bones  
Every single thing that you never want to see  
Add it all together and you got me  
I know nobody gives a fuck about your punk ass rules  
Keystone coppers and your hypocrite schools  
I'd much rather lay around the streets of the gutter  
And make dirty phone calls to your rich mother  
Caught her passed midnight and I'm waking up the dead  
Then we playin kickball with somebody's head  
We got skinny dipping in the barrels of toxic waste  
After that I pour myself a little taste  
So tell your daughter that she's nothing but a fat bitch  
And all my homies don't care if the hoes rich  
Somebody out here, please, let me know where there's a phone  
I need to call my mother and tell her I'm coming home  
[Chorus (1x)]  
[Violent J]  
And I'm coming home, chicken chicken bones  
Sugar prom bushes, and ice cream cones  
All these fake people sayin hi to one another  
Then they sit around and talk shit about each other  
Watering they grass, digging in they ass  
Trying to make sure they didn't lose any cash  
Working hard, all your life, and now you're finally rich  
But look at you, you're just another whack bitch  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Crawl in the slum that's where I'm from  
Murderers and slaughterers, so that's what I've become  
Spare a little change 'cause I just ran out of gas  
Reach for your quarter and I'll stick your fuckin ass  
[Violent J] Nobody wants to be around the ghetto breed  
But the ghetto got each other and that's all we really need

Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage. This ongoing event has been  
Upgraded to a national emergency. It has been a sleepless night here in Metro  
Detroit as panic and terror has swept the streets. It seems much of Detroit  
As well as the rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable  
Cloud that still clutches the sky. From New York to Honolulu, Miami to  
Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided but a wall of darkness and  
Artificial night still grips the land. Witnesses now tell us that thousands  
Upon thousands of people are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are  
Painted and they look like CLOWNS!!! The people are running and screaming but  
Eye witnesses say they're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy  
Has overtaken them. At this time we do not know where or why the people are  
Running but there seems to be an organized plan directing there action. Its  
Like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina. The immense crowd  
Of clowns are now on the move all in unison moving in one direction towards  
An unknown destination. Its almost as if they see what others cannot heeding  
An inaudible call that silently pierces this calm before the storm.

You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this,  
only I never really thought about how horrible it really is,  
laying in a coffin, in the pitch black dark,  
The only sound being that of my heart if I'm alive.  
But I've got no pulse or even breath for days,  
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze,  
But I do recall my funeral, them lowering me in,  
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in.  
I tried to move my fingers or somethin, got nothin,  
But dirt hitting the top from them shoveling, n I'm fucked.  
It's been at least two weeks but I don't keep time,  
I just lay here motionless in this rotting body of mine,  
I tried fantasy realms and dreaming my way out,  
It only leads to mind panicing and torturing thoughts about running and
breathing  
will it ever really happen again?  
Please God, heaven or hell just let something begin

Don't know,

Moms yelling cuz pops got his fists flying  
Its nine in the morning and he's drunk  
One day, I feel that I'm gonna shoot that punk  
My bitch laying next to me in the bed  
I honestly don't give a fuck if the ho is dead  
The only honor in my life is my rag  
Without it, zip me up in a body bag  
Grab my brothers unloaded forty-four  
Take the money-back bottles and head for the store  
My neighborhood your life is a dare  
Cuz there's factories pumping out black air  
And I'm breathing this shit everyday  
Living crazy, cuz I'm dying anyway  
I see this tramp hangin under the bridge  
I tell her go home and watch her kids  
You listen to them cry and sob  
Take your sorry ass and find a motherfucking job  
See my homies hanging at the liquor store  
40s in the catch, dice rollin on the floor  
They say my friendsll never be any good  
But the president wouldn't of been shit  
If he was raised in my neighborhood  
My friends say the same old shit  
The southwest side have a hit on me  
I guess everyones seen it  
When I slammed johnnys head into the cement  
It started all this crazy shit  
And now we never set out without a loaded clip  
And we headed up to the dunk rim  
Little boys on the court so we punked them out  
And I was thinking of my brother  
When he was pushed off the court he wanted to kill them fuckers  
Now I'm standing in the bad guys shoes  
Payin my dues  
And I don't have no where to be  
Just another street hood in the inner city  
And a man is gonna ask for some change  
Give him a dollar, so he can go and fry his brain  
Fuck no, I push him out the way  
Cuz that sad motherfucker got shit to say  
My homie was known for the mackin  
Now they got him doing 10 for car jackin  
And I'm thinkin that I'm next to go  
What the fuck I already live on death row  
So many out there want me  
Everybody wants to put a bullet in my head  
But I don't give a fuck if I die today  
Everyone alive is gonna die anyway  
What the fuck is life about  
Come home late and daddy blow your mouth out  
That's in the past now, I aint soft  
Daddy hits me today and I'm a blow his fuckin head off  
For now the bullets close but miss  
Livin my life at a risk  
You know, j, man, you're right  
Too many motherfuckers out there are fake  
People need to understand  
That if you get hit enough times  
Then you start hitting back  
All we are are pawns in the game board  
And if this is the way everyones playin it  
So be it, motherfuckers

I told my mother one day I'd be wealthy  
Can't forget my first day at school  
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil, but it's cool  
Get my education  
A job and a family, a good reputation  
And what about grade two?  
Got shot in the neck and the bullet went straight through  
But I'm packing a textbook  
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm going to grade three  
Thank god it's lunch in a minute  
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it  
And it cut my tongue off  
But I know how to multiply so what's up, boss  
Finally had to step out  
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out  
Who knows where the road led?  
Seen a man with a briefcase and no head  
So I'm like fuck that  
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack  
And I'm straighter than a fucking lightpost  
I sold a lot of crack but I bought the most  
Now I'm a basehead down on my luck  
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack Truck  
And thrown about a block  
But I'm thinking nothing but gimme a rock  
Holding my sign I'll work for crack  
With my old-ass E.T. shirt on my back  
And I'm sleeping in the gutter  
Right next to Jam Town's mother  
I'm eating dead rats in the street  
I keep on checking for my ownheart beat  
Now I'm weighing at a buck-o-five  
Twitchy little neck and I'm barely alive  
Got my first taste of life in hell  
I ate a dead, shh, but don't tell  
Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change?  
I'll cut your face off and eat your brains  
You know all about me  
You act like you ain't seen penatentiary  
Spitting and cussing and you know I'll piss  
With these iron braces on my fucking wrists  
And I'm heading for the slammer  
Serial killer, all on the camera  
First day, they broke my back  
Next day, they broke my neck  
Third day, they broke my leg  
Fourth day, they broke my head  
Swallowing kept on trucking  
But there'll be no fucking  
That's strictly for the soft  
Seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off  
So I'm finna escape  
How much shit can one clubno take?  
""Stop, fool. Stop or I'll fire""  
Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire  
I'm all tangled up, cut cut cut slit slit cut cut  
You don't love me, I really don't care  
Tie my ass up in the electric chair  
I got no family, I got no friends  
I pray to God that my life ends  
They thought that they had killed me  
They took me to the morgue  
I'm just a little stiff that's all, like a board  
I lay there in my coffin, just chill and wait and chill  
But then I jump out knife swinging all about  
And motherfucking-mother-mother-mother-motherfucking kill  
I used to wonder what life's about  
Until it chewed me up and spit me out  
Your ghetto created a psycho nut  
Not just psycho psycho nut  
Now I'm living in the walls of your house  
And I'll die there and lay and rot like a dead mouse  
I'm packing a sickle I'm on your roof and I'm playing the fiddle  
You want me in a straight jacket  
'cause when I see a throat, I'm a hack it  
Where I'm at? What's my name?  
Somehow, somewhere, I got hit by a train  
And it ripped my legs off  
Huh, nothing but a minor coft  
You can't get me I swing from a tree  
Shouting and cussing and shooting at me  
Everybody's end make two cents  
A branch broke and I fell on a picket fence  
I'm stuck and they're coming to get me  
Rip myself off and I took my lungs with me  
I'm stuffing them back in  
Fuck! They won't go back in  
Now my life's gettin' dense  
'cause my heart's still beating on a wooden fence  
They shoot me up and down  
Thinking thinking thinking clown  
Wicked wicked wicked clown  
You want to know all about a wicked clown I never had it made...

Insane Clown Posse,Ol Evil Eye,/i/insane+clown+posse/ol+evil+eye_20067683.html,"""Start tha movie.""  
  
""I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult.
For  
his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes it was this. One of his
eyes  
resembled that of a vulture. A pale blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it
fell upon me my  
blood ran cold. And so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the
life of  
the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever.""  
  
So I'm headed door to door  
With my grandmother's cookie jar.  
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar.  
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any.  
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny.  
Anybody, everybody, they hate me.  
I can tell when they spit and degrade me.  
There's only one house left, the last on the block.  
Old Man Willie on the hilltop.  
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open.  
And there it was starin' and scopin'.  
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'  
I was trippin'. ""Ahh, seeya!""  
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking  
About his eyeball winking and blinking.  
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh!  
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker.  
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me.  
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me.  
Creepers, where'd you get that ball?  
And tell me how it even fits in your skull.  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in.  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard.  
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!  
  
[Chorus]  
Evil eye...  
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! Die-die-die-die-die-die-die)  
Evil eye...  
Oh Oh  
  
""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you  
should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with caution
with  
what  
foresight, with what patience I went to work. I was never kinder to the old
man  
than  
during the whole week before I killed him.""  
  
A day gone pass since I heard about J.O.  
Met up in this sleigh, 'cause I don't fuckin' play.  
Anyway, I gotta do him in. Got a rusty revolver  
Put the silver bullets in.  
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget.  
Down my drawers with the bucket.  
It's time to go, fuck it.  
I stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door.  
I really didn't know what I was in for.  
First the cold man stared, no a gaze, no a stare.  
Kinda like there was no one there.  
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye.  
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine.  
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break.  
I gotta try to make.. my way to the gate.  
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground.  
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound,  
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face.  
This little old man's eye's a make me a mental case.  
That's when I felt the pain deep inside,  
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide.  
  
I want a big long knife to stick it in.  
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard.  
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hands on the heart
and  
there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye will  
trouble me  
no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer.""

I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping  
I was over there mowing the grass  
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass  
And then, I went inside to make a phone call  
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra  
One thing just led to another  
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother  
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately  
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.

When she spread my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud  
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin

She's freaky  
Her nipples look like peanuts  
Your mama's one of my favorite sluts  
She likes licking from the back of my balls  
to the tip of my dick with one big lick  
She calls me her big teddy bear  
Roooaaaaarrrrr!!!!!  
I chase her around on my underwear  
I'll admit I like spanking her butt

It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though  
And I ain't trying to diss her either  
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some  
Every hair is like a foot long

It's all right with me though  
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole

For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes  
So now the criminal they launch right in our face

Can you really tell me what life is?

Something vivid comes again into my mind  
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place

Iron Maiden,Fear Of The Dark,/i/iron+maiden/fear+of+the+dark_20067979.html,"I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's

You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.  
Times change very quickly,  
and you had to grow up early,  
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll die as you lived  
In a flash of the blade,  
In a corner forgotten by no one.  
You lived for the touch  
For the feel of the steel  
One man, and his honor.  
  
The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.  
He taught you all he knew  
To fear no mortal man  
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men.

A birdsong shatters the still.  
  
His eyes are ablaze,  
See the madman in his gaze.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly and touch the sun.  
  
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears  
Looks the old man in the eye  
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd  
In the name of God my father I fly.  
  
His eyes seem so glazed  
As he flies on the wings of a dream,  
Now he knows his father betrayed  
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,

Or a man of holy war  
Too many sides to you  
Don't know which anymore  
So many full of life  
But also filled with pain  
Don't know just how many  
Will live to breathe again  
  
A life that's made to breathe  
Destruction or defense  
A mind that's vain corruption  
Bad or good intent  
A wolf in sheep's clothing  
Or saintly or sinner  
Or some that would believe  
A holy war winner  
  
They fire off many shots  
And many parting blows  
Their actions beyond a reasoning  
Only God would know  
And as he lies in heaven  
Or it could be in hell  
I feel he's somewhere here  
Or looking from below  
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is  
Please tell me now what love is  
Well tell me now what war is  
Again tell me what life is  
  
More pain and misery in the history of mankind  
Sometimes it seems more like  
The blind leading the blind  
It brings upon us more famine, death and war  
You know religion has a lot to answer for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand  
They find its ashes that are  
Scattered across the land  
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind  
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins  
  
And all because of it you'd think  
That we would learn  
But still the body count the city fires burn  
Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man  
Tell me why, tell me why

For the greater good of God (x8)

To die for all of those  
Who never mourn his loss  
It wasn't meant for us  
To feel the pain again

The minds of the men who are on their way home  
  
I'm scarred for life  
But it's not my flesh that's wounded  
So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say 'don't worry'  
Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war

Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore

I feel that my spirit's broken  
I wonder if I've the strength

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun

And this is what it means

And we'll dream for evermore  
  
And the fragment remains of our memories  
And the shadows remain with our hands  
Deep gray, came to mourn  
All the colors of the dawn  
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

All the past years not so strange  
Our winter times are like a silent shroud  
And the heartbeat of the day  
Drives the mist away  
And winter's not the only dream around  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun

Selling them whiskey and taking their gold  
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Sensing the change in the tide again  
Brought by the storm that is brewing  
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear  
Some of the doubt in the things you believe  
Now that your faith will be put to the test  
Nothing to do but await what is coming  
  
Why then is god still protecting me  
Even when I don't deserve it  
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength  
Some they would call it a penance  
Why am I meant to face this alone  
Asking the question time and again  
Praying to God won't keep me alive  
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise  
  
They'll be saying their prayers  
when the moment comes  
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day  
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes  
They'll be coming to claim,  
take your soul away  
  
The sign of the cross  
The name of the rose  
a fire in the sky  
The sign of the cross  
  
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame  
They'll be bringing us all immortality  
Holding communion so the world be blessed  
My creator my God'll lay my soul to rest  
  
Lost the love of heaven above  
Chose the lust of the earth below

Then took the wall

The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again  
  
Being at the wrong place  
And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Can't name no names  
  
Some strange yellow gas  
Has played with their minds  
Has reddened their eyes  
Removed all the lies  
  
And strange as it sounds  
Death knows no bounds  
How many get well  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell

But what did you bring to the table  
Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept

To reveal the facade of faceless men

Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

Iron Maiden,The Thin Line Between Love And Hate,/i/iron+maiden/the+thin+line+between+love+hate_20067952.html,"When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?  
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost  
  
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win  
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
We all like to put the blame on society these days  
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings  
  
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart  
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad  
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane  
  
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn  
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Iron Maiden,The Unbeliever,/i/iron+maiden/the+unbeliever_20068095.html,"When you start to take a look within  
Do you feel at ease with what you see  
Do you think you can have peace of mind  
And have self-belief or be satisfied  
  
Do you think you even like yourself  
Or really think you could be someone else  
Is there something that you'd rather be  
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see  
  
All my life I've run away  
All my life I've tried to hide away  
  
Fell the paranoia creeping in  
Like a cancer eating at the skin  
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem  
And your self respect, what can you expect  
  
All my life, I've run astray  
Let my faith, slip away  
All my life, I've run astray  
Allowed my faith, to drift away  
  
Are you scared to look inside your mind  
Are you worried just at what you'll find  
Do you really want to face the truth  
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose  
  
Try to release the anger from within  
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins  
Do you really care what people think  
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails  
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails

Irving Berlin,The Hostess With The Mostes' On The Ball,/i/irving+berlin/the+hostess+with+the+mostes+on+the+ball_20221408.html,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land  
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand  
One day father started digging in a field  
Hoping to find some soil  
  
He dug and he dug and what do you think?  
Oil, oil, oil  
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high  
Washington was my destination  
And now who am I?  
  
I'm the chosen party giver  
For the White House clientele  
And they know that I deliver  
What it takes to make 'em jell  
  
And in Washington I'm known by one and all  
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
They could go to Elsa Maxwell  
When they had an axe to grind  
  
They could always grind their axe well  
At the parties she designed  
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call  
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
I've a great big bar and good caviar  
Yes, the best that can be found  
And a large amount in my bank account  
When election time comes 'round  
  
If you're feeling presidential  
You can make it, yes, indeed  
There are just three things essential  
Let me tell you all you need  
  
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall  
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
Entertaining vodka drinkers  
Is a job they give to me  
Making nice guys out of stinkers  
Seems to be my cup of tea  
  
What they really need behind the iron wall  
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
There's a book of regulations  
As to who sits next to who  
  
But there might be complications  
When the blue blood's not so blue  
So the priestess with the leastes' protocol  
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
An Ambassador has just reached the shore  
He's a man of many loves  
An important gent from the Orient  
To be handled with kid gloves  
  
He can come and let his hair down  
Have the best time of his life  
Even bring his new affair down  
Introduce her as his wife  
  
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall  
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
I've been highly complimented  
And I thank you what is more  
You'll be damned well represented  
By your new ambassador  
  
For my one ambition is to make them fall  
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
In the handbag that I'll carry  
There's a precious little note  
  
To their highnesses from Harry  
Introducing me he wrote:  
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small  
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""  
  
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes  
To make friends across the sea  
I'll make being smart an important part  
Of my foreign policy  
  
I'll cement our good relations  
When I give my first affair  
There'll be special invitations  
To the Duke and Duchess there  
  
Who's already written asking them to call  
Not the priestess with the leastes'  
But the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

A moment of bliss we spent  
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance  
As into the night we went  
And sang to our hearts' content  
The song is ended  
But the melody lingers on  
You and the song are gone  
But the melody lingers on  
The night was splendid  
And the melody seemed to say  
""Summer will pass away  
Take your happiness while you may""  
There 'neath the light of the moon  
We sang a love song that ended too soon  
The moon descended  
And I found with the break of dawn  
You and the song had gone  
But the melody lingers on

Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the
cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show  
  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men because  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause.  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?  
  
There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so  
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on
opening nights  
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there
in lights  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's
no attack  
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show  
  
(There's no business like show business like no business I know)  
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there
you are  
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the

For each beat of my heart  
For every breath I breathe  
Thank you, sweetie  
For the best times of my life  
Through the good, through the bad  
You were always by my side  
I never thought I meet someone  
Who loves unselfishly  
But I appreciate the way you loved  
And sacrificed for me  
  
Chorus  
I can't hold back these tears  
Let me cry  
(although a man's not suppose to cry)  
If I hold back my tears  
I'll just die  
(you've given so much to my life)  
  
Thank you, lady  
For the joy you bring to life  
When I thought all was lost and gone  
You brought hope back in sight  
Thank you, honey  
For being my best friend  
When I thought no one understood  
You would always understand  
I used to think that I knew love  
And what true love should mean  
Now I know that I did not know much  
'Cause you taught me everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
God so loved the world  
That he blessed us all with you  
And then he gave me a heart  
Now I'm giving it to you  
And these tears I cry are tears of joy  
My happiness, I do rejoice  
In the love you give unselfishly  
Your constant sacrifice for me

Liar dari yang terliar...  
  
Setiap detik lidah-lidah liar  
  
Rakus menjulur lapar...  
  
Tangis bayi adalah lolong  
  
Srigala... Di bawah bulan...  
  
Lengking tinggi merobek  
  
Batu-batu tebing keras dan kejam  
  
Bernafas diantara sikut  
  
Licik dan garang  
  
Bergerak diantara ganasnya  
  
Selaksa karat...  
  
Kota adalah hutan belantara  
  
Akal  
  
Kuat dan berakar...  
  
Menjurai...  
  
Di depan mata... Siap

Menahan dingin tanpa jas hujan  
  
Di simpang jalan Tugu Pancoran  
  
Tunggu pembeli jajakan koran  
  
Menjelang maghrib hujan tak reda  
  
Si Budi murung menghitung laba  
  
Surat kabar sore dijual malam  
  
Selepas isya melangkah pulang  
  
Anak sekecil itu berkelahi dengan waktu  
  
Demi satu impian yang kerap ganggu tidurmu  
  
Anak sekecil itu tak sempat nikmati waktu  
  
Dipaksa pecahkan karang, lemas jarimu terkepal  
  
Cepat langkah waktu pagi menunggu  
  
Si Budi sibuk siapkan buku  
  
Tugas dari sekolah selesai setengah  
  
Sanggupkah si Budi diam di dua sisi

Orang waras jadi ganas  
Hawa gerah hidup susah  
Ngomongnya ngaco di anggap gila  
Rumah kontrakkan belum terbayar  
Uang habis utang numpuk  
Pemasukkan belum jelas  
Pengeluaran sudah jelas  
Ooh . . . . . . . . . . apakah ini  
Siapa yang tahu  
Tak ada yang tahu  
Seringkali kita terpaksa berfikir  
Melihat orang yang menjadi gila  
Sebab tak sanggup lagi menanggung  
Beban hidup yang semakin berat  
Nasib baik belum datang  
Angin surga sering datang  
Kepala pusing kepanasan  
Mau menangis tidak bisa

This is my canvas  
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong, only a song  
I like to write alone, be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home  
But the only thing like home I've ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome  
Had no clue what you was goin' through  
How could you be so strong?  
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together

Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right  
I got two bitches playin' on my trombone  
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me  
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies  
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these  
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga  
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga  
Uh, couldn't resist  
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed  
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon  
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch  
Like thanks for the view  
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist  
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget  
Cole is your phone on zero percent  
Going off, now niggas showin' off

Voice gone and sh-t, I think it's gonna make it sound a little ill, just a
little iller  
Yup, Fayettenam, n-gga  
  
Yea, Carolina blue kicks pedal to the medal  
Feeling like a puppet and the devil is Geppetto  
Letter to the ghetto-hold ya head high  
You can pick apart my raps I ain't told ya na' lie  
I want a little darker, like to f-cking tan line  
Go on, look for a better n-gga, girl you can't find  
Fine young man with an old man mind,  
No time for the tickle, f-ck the whole mankind  
Aw no ma'am, I'm an old land mine  
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time, now I'm armed and I'm-  
Fayettenam's finest, Carolina saviour, marijuana blazer  
Only on occasion cause my mind be racing  
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian  
Thinking how these rap n-ggas got to be faking  
Whole style obviously copied, pasted-plagiarized swag  
May arrived last but when it's all said and done I'ma be ahead of them  
Way that I describe it, prescribe a n-gga medicine  
Way that I be fly-I be higher than the Jet-e-sons  
Moving on up, n-gga higher than the Jeffersons  
All about the Benjamin's, bad chicks send em' in!  
Basic hoes toss em out! Can't even get waffle house  
Hating n-ggas chalk em out! Go and get the coffin out  
What chu talking bout?  
Little man, my sh-t hair burning you not even a little tan  
I'm I'll enough to kill cancer, baby I'm Chemo  
Down in Miami, and I throw like Marino  
Get a whole lot of you know, and she bald like an eagle.  
No, not up top, but down there  
She said she want to hop on top girl I don't care  
You better get yours before I reach mines cause then I'm throwing peace signs  
If you a freak I can take you to ya peak, girl I do it to the maxima-Nissan  
And I hope you a believer  
I'm quarterbacking trynna get cha open like receivers  
Far from an overnight achievers, Cole is like the leader of the new n-ggas!  
To tell the truth, I'm only f-cking with a few n-ggas, if that!  
The rest of ya'll n-ggas get lapped  
I sit back, and reflect on the rap game I came from out of no where  
N-gga, I swear them lames ain't know how to prepare  
Got n-ggas shouting out ""The Ville-I got to go there! ""  
Boy, don't you know you get shot over there?  
I say my prayers cause this life ain't fair,  
A bunch of backstabbing n-ggas hope the knife ain't there  
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain't there  
Yea late at night, when I got the phone call and made her right  
When my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head, hit it then I quit it
'fore she even made the bed  
Damn I'm no good  
But damn it's so good  
I'm picturing that body like a camera phone would  
Something like Rihanna while I'm up in that vagina  
Type of chick that only dress in something that's designer  
I could give a f-ck long as there's something that's behind her  
Got the type of bump that make a dog want to hump her  
Back to the topic-actually forgot it  
Hoes, money, I'm the shit... Oh yea I'm reminded  
The way I put the words together cleverly align them  
These other rap n-ggas shouldn't never be a problem

So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying
to pull away. At no time di the officer said that he was going to do anything
until he pulled out his weapon was drawn and he said, ""I'll shoot you"" or,
""I'm going to shoot"" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We
looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took
off running.

Something's got me down  
I was there my ground,  
Don't just stand around  
Don't just stand around  
  
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for
my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend,he kept running, he
feared for me too. So as the officer was trying to get out the car he pursued
my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him
or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn.
He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his
hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached
with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died.

Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho  
But temptation stays round  
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?  
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend  
A little freakin', but them niggas holla  
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'

Living fast you wouldn't mash the brakes for me""

Let me holla at you,  
Yeah I know it's been a while, but ain't no better time then now  
Can I holla at you,

Ay, let me holla at you  
Yeah I know it's been a while, but  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
You betrayed me,  
The day you played my momma you played me  
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga  
I should've, followed my instincts a stranger in my house  
Only five years old but sense danger in my house  
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ain't want to  
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you  
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops  
Put me on to 'Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops  
Who would've thought you'd leave my momma high and dry  
Last words to a bitch nigga ""why you lie?""  
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled  
When you left I watched that lady crumble  
I know probably by now you a old man,  
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands  
For all the ass whoppings  
Heard you tryna' talk to that punk don't call me  
You ain't shit and I'm scared it rubbed off on me  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain't true  
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through  
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you  
Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew  
And plus you act like you don't know me  
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name  
See me do my thing, you expecting me to act strange  
Hey holla but you on my mind nigga  
I don't forget the good times nigga  
White tee's in the club, jeans baggy as fuck  
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff  
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality  
You know that old kill or be killed mentality  
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality  
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me  
Chasin' hoes like the old days,  
But now we overseas, dawg  
Congratulations on your seat  
Yo my nigga can I holla at you

J Cole,Chaining Day,/j/j+cole/chaining+day_21032199.html,"Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought  
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result  
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart  
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought  
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes  
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby  
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet  
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet  
This is everything they told a nigga not to do  
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do  
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe  
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave  
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you  
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you  
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do  
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you  
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another  
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother  
My partner said that's just the game my nigga  
Swear I heard my jeweler say, ""Here go your chain my nigga""  
  
This is chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair  
  
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy  
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly  
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at  
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at  
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you  
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you  
And I ain't got no investment portfolio  
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo  
I know back home where niggas sit today  
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say  
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake  
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break  
But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it 'til you make it""  
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it  
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up  
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks  
I gave it up, for what  
  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear  
  
Lord  
This is the last time  
Told my accountant, It's the last time  
I swear this is the last time  
I know that I said that last time  
But this the last time  
Mama I swear this is the last time  
So don't take my Chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I chose this slavery  
This is the last time  
Don't take my chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I love this slavery  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me

And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all  
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more  
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight  
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all  
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved  
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall  
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle  
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble  
Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary  
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae

I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry  
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly  
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me  
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue  
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew  
See, when you're spittin' so real  
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal  
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal  
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell  
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' bout diplomacy  
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see  
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be  
I think they scared of me, and they should be

That aunty sippin on, we missin ya  
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up  
This is us  
Got some niggas that never call me unless they need something,  
But I pick up, like, ""whassup, what you need cousin?""  
My niggas know that I love 'em  
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em  
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow  
Used to borrow your digital scale  
Flippin' them sales  
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past  
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger  
The swishers and dutch fill up  
Bitches in lust with us  
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way  
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing  
Had a talk and she remark: ""you so engaging""  
Running game, it's all the same

Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and  
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then

Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now he buggin'

And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't

And I'm showing love saying ""yo look what I did,  
Ain't nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big""

Shit what about me, nigga what about me?

Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track  
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back

I see you headed to the top you need to let me catch up  
Please let me catch up  
Won't you let me catch up man""

And fame a part of history no longer known  
Done did a lot of dirt I'll bury with me when I'm gone  
When my story's told, how will they tell it?  
Will they say I was a giver or will they say I was selfish  
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint  
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon paint  
Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter that's one thing I know I aint aint  
Will they tarnish, will they taint?  
Glorify me, overthink, say they know me, say I'm great  
Say I'm phoney, I was fake  
Say the things about me they never told me to my face  
I was loved I was hated  
Just a n-gga with a dream  
I'm a liar I was honest, I was all of these things

Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin  
Keeping demons buried in my closet  
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account  
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out  
Those were truly my best days  
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid  
Gradually turn into me stressin' how the hell to get paid  
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played  
Ok, I'm blowing up quickly  
I guess the flow is sickly  
But yet I can't forget my past and hope it won't forget me  
Got good grades but age can't stop strays so pray for me  
Pour liquor for my n-ggas but hey, don't wait for me  
Cause I'm trying to cheat death, she had to bury my ass  
You know the cliche ""lifes a bitch"" well I'm gon marry that ass  
And sign a pre-nup  
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up  
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club  
Gave mean mugs to n-ggas but we winked to all the girls  
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the World  
No way, came a long way from having mom chauffer  
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure  
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back

Said that's for busters that heard my sh-t and I made it cool  
This aint to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping  
I got gangsta n-ggas that lining up in that missions office  
And possibly cause all the hoe n-ggas scrape  
And I sh-t up on my plate so you know a n-gga late to my first class  
I'd much rather sit up in first class  
Should I admit that a slutty b-tch was my first smash  
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out  
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about  
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout  
I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind  
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind  
Was just a young boy staring out my blind  
Till I got free from my momma leash  
Running loose through the streets  
Like a stray dog in heat  
And we looking for some freaks can you play  
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame  
No not me  
She do hours on the team cause she seen how tall I'd be  
In the club dappin' n-ggas, even til he are-I-P  
Damn, you win some, you lose some  
That just how it's happens  
And if a n-gga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em  
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom  
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping  
Cause see some n-ggas was haters that I viewed as clowns  
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around  
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now  
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down

Strictly for the survivors  
The 800 number dodgers  
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone  
When the number unknown  
Tell them people I aint home  
Half black learning white lies  
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys  
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirls'll clown like  
""Girl I aint know you like 'em bitesize""  
She embarrassed now  
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now  
They probably think I'm no good for 'em  
Too dark, too thick, too hood for 'em  
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I'm doing here  
They got me feeling like a job interview in here  
They asking questions about a 5 year plan  
She saying ""who I'm foolin', they could never understand""  
They could never understand

The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere  
Still I'm wathcing cnn tryna keep up  
In my interviews maybe I should speak up  
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time  
And keep 'em niggas walking blind all the time  
But the same niggas think I'm fucking dimes all the time  
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time  
And I feed into it  
I'd rather make tracks where I bleed into it  
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book  
I can only pray that one day you'll read into it  
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems  
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums  
I zone out, that old sound that I've grown out of  
Was born out of being broke with hope  
But it don't matter I'm on Saturn now and I won't shatter  
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I'm gonna gather my thoughts  
As sharp as a bow and arrow  
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel  
My flow's thorough, now I'm more aware of the? A nigga face  
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake  
That's why I call the shit a race  
Tha gony of defeat, w ish the elite could get a taste  
  
[Chorus:]

I Just can't believe

A lot of sh-t been changing the time you've been gone  
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner  
And went and got baby's the day they got a diploma  
Damn, there'll be some n-ggas missing when you fly back  
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq  
Old buddy that we hoop with, with a bad chick and a fly lac  
Anda gold chain, caught him on a merc, tryna buy crack  
Damn homie, sh-t, in high school you was the man homie  
F-ck happened to you,  
Used to beat n-ggas down at the buses after school  
Now you looking like a muthaf-cking fool

Say I'll be home for the holidays  
So when you see me, better holla at me  
I gotta get up put this city 'fore it try to trap me  
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay  
But I'll be home for the holidays  
And to those that I used to know  
From way before, keep your head up  
Come lets get this bread up  
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay  
But I'm coming hme for the holidays

But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love  
Although now I'm on my grown sh-t

Dressed like a black man in college sh-t  
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics  
But I still gotta holla at my old chick  
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me  
She said ""we aint homies no more""  
You go to college and you act like you don't know me no more  
Girl, we got history semester seem so long  
The last time I seen ya baby you aint have no clothes on  
So if history repeats itself  
When I get home, girl it's on, you aint gone need ya belt  
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind  
Just don't give it up in the meantime

I know you know them act a fool days  
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed  
That trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly  
But a n-gga had a shot you'd have thought that's where the bulls play  
Wished this freshman could used a little Kool-aid  
Crushing on them upper clansmen but it was tool late  
Buddy she was dating he had the freshest shoes  
But the n-gga was graduated but he never made two a's  
Hey if you're listening we got in to school  
But who will pay our tuition man  
These n-ggas crazy  
One year cost about the same as a Mercedes (benz)  
Four years cost white crib and a baby  
Ay maybe this aint for me  
If only I could be Lebron with the strength to leave  
The worst part about growing up man the shit just aint for free  
Maybe I can be someone people pay to see  
And maybe I should move up outta here to the place to be  
To get from a to z ay what you think I'm crazy

By the time I'm back on the streets like a bachelor  
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman

Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole  
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying

Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit

Through out the years, she'd tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better

Chain like a kaleidoscope, see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler, how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie, I ain't making rules up  
Started from the bottom, same way you lace your shoes up

But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas

Free from pain, free from scars  
Free to sing, free from bars  
Free my dawgs, you're free to go  
Block gets shot, the streets is cold  
Free to love, to each his own  
Free from bills, free from pills  
You roll it loud, the speakers blow  
Life get hard, you eat your soul  
It clears your mind, learn to fly  
Then reach the stars, you take your time  
And look behind and said what I can  
Look how far I done came  
They say that dreams come true  
And when they do that there's a beautiful thing  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free

We talked about her dreams you gotta start off with somethin'  
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustlin'  
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck-in  
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went  
She said your guess is good as mine  
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time  
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga  
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga  
Well, movin on  
Funny cause I only know a couple of your songs  
But I love when they come on  
Word?  
  
Ill take it, baby I'll take it  
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mind play?  
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick  
This is superstar dick

That's a little egotistic  
My amigos be hocking in Toledo  
Niggas winning off me, it's all G,  
Cause he know bitches can't get the Michael  
So they settling for Tito  
We know, yeah nigga we know  
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino  
Niggas so thirsty it irks me  
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though  
Nah nigga, the game is to get  
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit  
I swear if niggas put half  
Of what they put in chasing ass into a craft  
By now you'd be famous and rich  
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch  
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,  
She thinking she got a first round pick  
She thinking bout all the things she can get  
She thinking you got a range for a whip  
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause  
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her  
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word  
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver  
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word, wanna ride my nouns  
Let her suck my verbs aye  
  
Ill take it, baby I'll take it  
Why I'm starin' at you cause I'm picturing you naked  
Know whats on your mind embrace it, do not fake it  
Tonight is what you make it, take it do not waste it  
Take a shot you not wasted, look in the blocks with mind play?

This may be the last time you see me free ma  
Don't spend it cryin'  
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'  
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police  
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep  
A drunk and high fool  
Skip a class, fluncking high school  
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned  
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned  
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed  
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned  
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy  
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me  
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me  
At times I wonder 'bout my father  
Would it change for me if he was around?  
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's  
Bum ass n-ggas no jobs, no life  
Seen them n-ggas killed for no price  
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light  
I pulled the trigger momma  
Tryna be hard, I aint mean to kill the n-gga momma  
But what's done is done  
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer  
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer  
  
Yeh, now I'm a killer  
Guess I'm a killer  
They got me in here with the killers  
Yeah I mean the killers  
  
I wonder what's in store for me  
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me  
Than just a simple life  
N-ggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life  
Gave up the jump shot  
Work on the john shot  
Who woulda thought I used to block this n-ggas lay ups  
Now he's in a cell layed up  
I wish you well, stay up  
Like insomniacs  
This life can make a n-gga fold like a laundry mat  
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain  
And so that I react slow, in this fast world  
Slow n-ggas, fast girls  
Hoes give up ass while these ho n-ggas hold triggers  
Blast on 'em  
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign  
It's deep, all these cold hearted n-ggas holding heat  
I'd rather blast before they steal a n-gga  
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer  
  
Yeah, into a killer  
Don't make me turn into a killer  
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh  
  
To those who had love for me in the past  
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast  
I remember back in class we used to make believe  
Like it was draft day  
Swore that we would make the league, be rich  
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time, the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary  
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary  
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary  
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary  
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict  
And he stay on with that thriller

Now realizing when I hit she never forgets  
So every time I ignore the telephone call  
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call

You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!  
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac  
When he slept with Madonna  
Hey, this is death before dishonor  
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama  
She got enough to stress about  
My nigga gonna get me out  
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors  
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records  
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?  
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it  
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it  
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it  
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?  
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set  
It goes tick-tock, game on lock  
Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop  
Oh no!  
  
If I should die before I wake  
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take  
My soul to take, my soul to take

And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays  
You can keep that shit, I just made a million  
Call me when reach that shit  
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light  
One time for my granny up would happen tonight  
And a young boy from a show down in hampton  
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer  
Didn't know what to say, I just froze  
Little too deep I suppose  
But after a year of review  
I figured it out it wasn't me  
It was you nigger, congratulations

I'm blessed nigga, I'm blessed

Turn 'em into poems, they worship, I'm the best

Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest

Unimpressed with you niggas  
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas

I told niggas on the low, but they ain't hear it though  
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle  
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow  
We eating better than we was a few years ago  
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's May day  
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors  
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn't fade us  
Bitch I made straight A's, go 'head, try and degrade us, haters  
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones  
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody's got a story dog  
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog  
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog  
With hits like a porno blog  
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour  
Ain't judging though, to each his own  
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home  
More power to you, but a message to you f-ck niggas  
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna f-ck with you  
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time  
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine  
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new  
Same old, f-ck it though, what's up with you?  
If you made it this far listening without skipping  
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting  
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission  
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position  
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen  
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate  
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!  
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping  
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?  
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life  
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right  
I find myself fiendin' for a spot to go at night  
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite  
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life  
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up over night (Boom!)  
  
[Outro:]  
Hey, yo, it's happening fast  
I say it's happening fast  
All the drama that I had to get past  
Will it last? Or will it pass?  
Just as quick as it came  
Hoes knowing my name  
Dog, welcome to fame  
I pray to God we don't change  
But even if you don't  
Most niggas look at you strange

As I do so well  
  
[Verse 1]  
Wasn't nothin' like that  
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time  
She was in my math class  
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass  
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes  
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes  
It started off so innocent  
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it  
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool  
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school  
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her  
Got me daydreaming, man what  
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it  
Make it hard for me to stand up  
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and  
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'  
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before  
She wrote a note that said ""You ever had sex before?""  
Damn  
  
[Hook]  
And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before,"" knowing I was frontin'  
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'  
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son  
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one  
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me  
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me  
My mama gone for the weekend  
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""  
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'  
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up  
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed  
Teacher, please don't make me stand up  
I wrote back like ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan""  
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man  
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned  
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin  
Fuck  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know that feeling when you you finna bone for the first time  
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time  
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with  
And most of all I'm praying, ""God don't let me bust quick""  
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right  
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right  
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'  
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection  
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing  
And a nigga roll over on top  
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing  
On me, ooh girl don't stop  
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I
practiced  
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said  
""I wanna get something off my mental  
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause""

Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass  
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass  
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight  
Was he stressing you, wasn't fucking you right  
Well one man's trash is another man's treasure  
One man's pain is another man's pleasure  
One damn thing you can't change is the weather

Nope, I'm peeking at your ass, winking at your ass

And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough  
Whole time, a little more girls

Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer  
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther  
Love my women with high heels and high standards  
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers  
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat  
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads split my pole  
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners

Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop

No check back, in debt yep  
Loud in my jay, y'all smoke that gallaudet  
Higher than I need to be

Jackson Browne,Knock On Any Door,/j/jackson+browne/knock+on+any+door_20068564.html,"Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Baby knock on any door  
Knock on any door  
Is there any place you want to go  
Baby who you lookin' for  
  
Yeah, yeah, baby now you know  
It's a cold world like they told you so  
  
Knock on any door  
Save your tears for some occasion  
Keep your heartache to yourself  
Knock on any door  
It's a simple operation  
Just trade your memory for your health  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
  
It's insane girl, you can't run away  
It's the same world it was yesterday  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
  
Now, now, now how do you survive  
With a pain so real, in a world so jive  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Peek through any shade  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on

Jackson Browne,Late For The Sky,/j/jackson+browne/late+for+the+sky_20068622.html,"The words had all been spoken  
And somehow the feeling still wasn't right  
And still we continued on through the night  
Tracing our steps from the beginning  
Until they vanished into the air  
Trying to understand how our lives has led us there  
  
Looking hard into your eyes  
There was nobody I'd ever known  
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone  
  
Now for me some words come easy  
But I know that they don't mean that much  
Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch  
You never knew what I loved in you  
I don't know what you loved in me  
Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be  
  
Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone  
And close to the end of the feeling we've known  
  
How long have I been sleeping  
How long have I been drifting alone through the night  
How long have I been dreaming I could make it right  
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might  
To be the one you need  
  
Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone  
And close to the end of the feeling we've known  
  
How long have I been sleeping  
How long have I been drifting alone through the night  
How long have I been running for that morning flight  
Through the whispered promises and the changing light  
Of the bed where we both lie  
Late for the sky

His woman is his bass and he is loving her, loving her  
Listen to the sounds he's giving  
As he is living  
True to lavender  
  
Listen to the things my friend is saying now  
A poetry of notes as he is playing now, playing now  
Listen to the tales he's telling  
Magic bass compelling  
Lavender  
  
Listen to my bass man, he is lavender  
His fingerboard's a highway, he's a traveler, traveler  
Listen to his fingers making music  
Hear his soul embarking

Olive green pillows on ebony floors

Promises kept and promises broken  
They're all the same whether silent or spoken  
They're not worth a penny  
I didn't make many  
I didn't break any  
  
Roads that are leaving and roads that have gone  
Oh every road moves but the one that I'm on

And I should be leaving  
Why am I not leaving

I think my heart must just be slowing down  
Among the human beings in their designer jeans  
Am I the only one who hears the screams  
And the strangled cries of lawyers in love  
God sends his spaceships to America, the beautiful  
They land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful  
Eating from TV trays, tuned into to Happy Days  
Waiting for World War III while Jesus slaves  
To the mating calls of lawyers in love  
Last night I watched the news from Washington, the capitol  
The Russians escaped while we weren't watching them, like Russians will  
Now we've got all this room, we've even got the moon  
And I hear the U.S.S.R. will be open soon  
As vacation land for lawyers in love

Jackson Browne,Linda Paloma,/j/jackson+browne/linda+paloma_20068657.html,"At the moment the music began  
And you heard the guitar player starting to sing  
You were filled with the beauty that ran  
Through what you were imagining  
  
Dreaming of scenes from those songs of love  
I was the endless sky  
And you were my Mexican dove  
  
Now the music that played in your ears  
Grows a little bit fainter each day  
And you find yourself looking through tears  
At the love you feel slipping away  
  
Though it's not the kind  
Of love you might hope to find  
If tears could release the heart  
From the shadows preferred by the mind  
  
Like a wind that comes up in the night  
Caressing your face while you sleep  
Love will fill your eyes with the sight  
Of a world you can't hope to keep  
  
Dreaming on after that moment's gone  
The light in your lover's eyes  
Disappears with the light of the dawn  
  
But the morning brings  
Strength to your restless wings  
And some other lover sings  
To the sun's bright corona  
  
I know all about these things

Fly away

Jackson Browne,Looking Into You,/j/jackson+browne/looking+into+you_20068547.html,"Well I looked into a house I once lived in  
Around the time I first went on my own  
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of  
And my friends and I were one  
Now the distance is done and the search has begun  
I've come to see where my beginnings have gone  
  
Oh the walls and the windows were still standing  
And the music could be heard at the door  
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions  
Asked if I came very far  
And when my silence replied they took me inside  
Where their children sat playing on the floor  
  
Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on  
And it left me so warm and so high  
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun  
I heard that highway whisper and sigh  
Are you ready to fly?  
  
And I looked into the faces all passing by  
It's an ocean that will never be filled  
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles  
That even love cannot rebuild  
It's a hotel at best, you're here as a guest  
You oughta make yourself at home while you're waiting for the rest  
  
Well I looked into dream of the millions  
That one day the search will be through  
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions  
Looking into you  
  
The great song traveler passed through here  
And he opened my eyes to the view  
And I was among those who called him a prophet  
And I asked him what was true  
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone  
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own  
  
Well I looked into the sky for my anthem  
And the words and the music came through  
But words and music can never touch the beauty that I've seen  
Looking into you -- and that's true

Jackson Browne,My Opening Farewell,/j/jackson+browne/my+opening+farewell_20068548.html,"Baby stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching her restless day  
  
She turns from her window to me  
Sad smile her apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
And still she spares me the words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting her feelings  
Struggles to speak, but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind  
So I'm offering these to her as if to be kind:  
There's a train everyday leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
There's a way to go  
And you'll soon be gone, it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk lying, on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To Lock you safe behind this open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd asked you to see what you may never see  
And now my kind words find their way back to me  
There's a train everyday, leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
You got a way to go  
And I'll soon believe, it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell

You've got to be free  
But to go on attempting to break into the prison  
You'd have to be me  
  
I wait for the sun to rise over the mountain  
I wait for your touch  
I wait for your angels to carry me home  
But I wait too much  
  
Waiting for you  
I have no problem telling right from wrong  
Fiction from what's true  
No problem telling the dream from the dawn  
  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you  
  
I wanted to live in the realm of the senses  
You've got to know how  
And for some kinds of pleasure there are no defenses  
I know that now  
  
Our love is a crackling ladder of lightning  
Our love is a fire  
Our love is a wave moving deep in an ocean  
Of need and desire  
  
Waiting for you  
I have no problem with this crooked world  
I play the cards I drew  
No problem with the changes life has hurled  
  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you  
  
I need your wonder and I need your light  
I need your tender touch to heal the night  
I need you laughing and I need you free  
And I need to lock you away deep inside of me  
Waiting for you  
  
I have no problem telling right from wrong  
The way some people do  
I know exactly where these arms belong  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you

I got a broken white line (I'm still sober)  
There ain't nothin' but time between this Silver Eagle  
And that New Jersey line  
  
Well it's a rock and roll band or a movie you can take your pick  
And it ain't bad work if you can get it  
But you gotta make it stick  
But getting any kind of sleep on this rolling motel, that's the trick

Jackson Browne,Of Missing Persons,/j/jackson+browne/of+missing+persons_20068531.html,"Your father was a rounder

A leaper and a bounder  
Down to his gypsy soul  
The music was his angel  
And sorrow was his star  
And those of us who follow  
Might hope to reach as far  
  
They're walking slow in Houston  
Speechless in D.C.  
There's no way I could tell you  
What he meant to me  
  
Your mother's a survivor  
She'll do what must be done  
Her children will revive her  
And help her see the sun  
She almost knew that unison  
But the singing stopped too soon  
Now she shares the silence  
With a man up in the moon  
  
To speak of missing persons  
Tonight there's only one  
And we all carry with us what the man's begun  
  
And you can sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
In the sunny south and the frozen north  
It's a day of loss, it's your day of birth  
Does it take a death to learn what a life is worth?  
  
Your brothers are all older  
And they'll take it in their stride  
The world's a little colder  
But manhood's on their side  
Now you're the little girl-child  
And you look so much like him  
And he's right there inside you  
Each time you want to sing  
  
Sing of missing persons  
Tonight there's only one  
But he's where you can find him when it's said and done  
  
And we will sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
From the sunny south and the frozen north  
This will always be your day of birth  
May you always see what your life is worth

Across my home has grown the shadow  
Of a cruel and senseless hand  
Though in some strong hearts  
The love and truth remain  
And it has taken me this distance  
And a woman's smile to learn  
That my heart remains among them  
And to them I must return  
  
But it's a long way that I have come  
Across the sand to find you here  
Among these people in the sun

Running on, running blind  
Running on, running into the sun

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive  
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive

Running on, running into the sun

If I can get you to smile before I leave

The stars above and the lights below  
Among those there to test their fortunes and their wills  
I lost track of the score long ago  
  
Pages turning  
Pages we were years from learning  
Straight into the night our hearts were flung  
Better bring your own redemption when you come  
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from  
  
Childhood comes for me at night  
Voices of my friends  
Your face bathing me in light  
Hope that never ends  
  
Pages turning  
Pages torn and pages burning  
Faded pages, open in the sun  
Better bring your own redemption when you come  
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from.  
Better bring your own redemption when you come  
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from.

Jackson Browne,The Fuse,/j/jackson+browne/the+fuse_20068659.html,"It's coming from so far away  
It's hard to say for sure  
Whether what I hear is music or the wind  
Through an open door  
There's a fire high in the empty sky  
Where the sound meets the shore  
There's a long distance loneliness  
Rolling out over the desert floor  
  
And the years that I spent lost in the mystery  
Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum  
Like a part of me  
It speaks to the heart of me  
Forget what life used to be  
You are what you choose to be  
It's whatever it is you see  
That life will become  
  
Whatever it is you might think you have  
You have nothing to lose  
Through every dead and living thing  
Time runs like a fuse  
And the fuse is burning  
And the earth is turning  
  
Though the years give way to uncertainty  
And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will  
There's a part of me  
That speaks to the heart of me  
Though sometimes it's hard to see  
It's never far from me  
Alive in eternity  
That nothing can kill  
  
Oh Lord  
Are there really people starving still?  
Look out beyond the walls of Babylon  
How long will their needs go unfilled  
I want to say right now I'm going to be around  
I'm going to be around  
When the walls and towers are crumbling  
When the towers are tumbling down  
And I will tune my spirit to the gentle sound  
I want to hear the sound  
Of the waters lapping on a higher ground  
Of the children laughing

Knowing she never could pass on a dare  
And knowing it sounded more desperate than reckless or bold  
I just put it out there cold, too far gone to care  
  
My eyes on the road, she slid herself down in the seat  
And a vision of paradise swung into view  
Across those five lanes not one driver glanced over to see  
The beauty known only to me, and a big rig or two  
  
On that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty, a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home  
  
With the trace of a smile and that defiant look in her eye  
She hurtled through space in a world of her own  
And turning aside my caress spoke of all that she'd not yet done  
As if I was the doubting one who would have to be shown  
  
On that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty, a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home  
  
She gathered her clothes  
And ran through the yard in the dark  
Up onto the porch like a flash, and inside  
Then one room at a time  
I watched every light in our house come on  
Like the truth that would eventually dawn,  
Forcing me to decide  
  
But on that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty, a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home

Girls in daddy's car  
You sing about the nights  
And you laugh about the scars  
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons  
You talk about the weather  
And you grin about the rooms  
Phone calls long distance  
To tell how you've been  
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins  
  
And when you stop to let em know  
You've got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
The ladies come to see you  
If your name still rings a bell  
They give you damn near nothin  
And they'll say they knew you well  
So you tell em you'll remember  
But they know its just a game  
And along the way their faces  
All begin to look the same  
And when you stop to let em know  
You got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
Well it isn't for the money  
And its only for a while  
You stalk about the rooms  
And you roll away the miles  
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars  
You're right about the moon  
But you're wrong about the stars  
And when you stop to let em know

And returned again when you smiled  
And how the light would invade and divide

Hidden from our view

Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields  
This prison is opening

Though they don't know why  
They hope and try -- live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery,  
Can you hear the choir?  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Abandon your sad history  
And meet me in the fire  
Our angels wait  
To take us higher and higher  
Higher and higher

No baptism, no reprise and no sweet taste of victory  
All the stars have fallen from the sky  
And everything else in between  
Satellites have closed their eyes  
The moon has gone to sleep  
Unloved... Unloved... Unloved... Unloved...  
  
Here I am inside a hotel  
Choking on a million words I said  
Cigarettes have burned a hole  
And dreams are drunk and penniless  
Here I am inside my father's arms  
All jagged bone and whisky dry  
Whisper to me sweetly now and tell me I will never die  
Unloved... Unloved... Unloved... Unloved  
  
Here I am an empty hallway  
Broken window, rainy night  
I am nineteen sixty-two and I am ready for a fight  
People crying hallelujah  
While the bullet leaves the gun  
People falling, falling, falling  
And I don't know where they're falling from  
Unloved... Unloved... Unloved... Unloved  
  
Hoping that the kindness will lead us  
Past the blindnes and  
Not another living soul  
Will ever have to feel  
Unloved... Unloved... Unloved... Unloved

Bought in a supermarket  
  
Streets I ran, through wind and rain,  
Around this place amongst streaming sunshine.  
Scared I was, sweating now.  
Feeling of doom, my bowels turned to water  
  
I felt hot breath whisper in my ear  
I looked for somewhere to hide but every wheres closed  
I shut my eyes pretend not to be here  
This feelings much to real to ever disappear, oh no

And I'm so scared dear  
My love comes in frozen packs

I was alone, no one was there  
I was alone, no one was there  
I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children  
I got a feeling of optimism  
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture  
The streets below left me feeling dirty, and  
I was alone, no one was there  
I was alone, no one was there  
Something's gonna crack on your dreams tonight...  
You will crack on your dreams tonight

And mans supposedly is made of sand  
It seems that man cannot survive at all

Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone  
The times inside I spent screaming at you  
Release me please from this mortal jail  
One shrug or smile can determine my fate,  
I'm lost for days and have myself to blame

Something like sunlight, love is a spotlight

A mirrored image, of what you wanted to be.

You can't remember, what it was you wanted anyway.  
The fingers feel the lines, they prod the space,  
Your aging face, the face that once was so beautiful,  
Is still there but unrecognizable,  
Private hell.  
  
The man who you once loved, is bald and fat,  
And seldom in, working late as usual.  
Your interest has waned, you feel the strain,  
The bed springs snap, on the occasions he lies upon you,  
Close your eyes and think of nothing but,  
Private hell.  
  
Think of Emma, wonder what she's doing,  
Her husband terry, and your grandchildren.  
Think of Edward, who's still at college,  
You send him letters, which he doesn't acknowledge.  
cause he don't care,  
They don't care.  
cause they're all going through their own - private hell.  
  
The morning slips away, in a Valium haze,  
And catalogs, and numerous cups of coffee.  
In the afternoon, the weekly food,  
Is put in bags, as you float off down the high street  
  
The shop windows reflect, play a nameless host,  
To a closet ghost, a picture of your fantasy,  
A victim of your misery, and private hell  
  
Alone at 6 o'clock, you drop a cup,  
You see it smash, inside you crack,  
You can't go on, but you sweep it up  
  
Safe at last inside your private hell.  
Sanity at last inside your private hell.

We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.

The structure never seems to get any higher  
Because we keep kicking out the foundations  
And stand useless while our lives fall down.

But the world in which I live in - keeps trying to prove me wrong.  
  
Out in the pastures we call society

Only young but easily shocked  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -  
  
Just like sheep - little lambs into the slaughter  
Don't fully grasp what exactly is wrong -  
Truth is you never cared - still -  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -

And stop reveling in rejection  
And follow yourselves, not some ageing drain brain  
Whose quite content to go on feeding you garbage
