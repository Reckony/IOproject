Glee,All By Myself,/g/glee/all+by+myself_20909390.html,"When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
Living alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
When I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
Hard to be sure...  
Sometimes I feel so insecure  
And loves so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore

I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see baby  
Standing right outside my door

Glee,An Innocent Man,/g/glee/an+innocent+man_21072632.html,"Some people stay far away from the door  
If there's a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know you're only protecting yourself  
I know you're thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But I'm not above  
Making up for the love  
You've been denying you could ever feel  
I'm not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
I'm only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that it's easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you don't want to hear what I say  
I know you're gonna keep turning away  
But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
I'm not above going through it again

Fight I  
Can lose

Innocent

Was a little nappy headed boy

Was for Christmas what would be my toy  
Even though we sometimes  
Would not get a thing  
We were happy with the  
Joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door  
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine  
Greeted at the back door  
Boy I thought I told you not to go outside

Tryin' your best to bring the  
Water to your eyes  
Thinkin' it might stop her  
From woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?  
I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?  
Cause I love them so  
  
[Verse:]  
Brother says he's tellin'  
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl  
Just don't tell and I'll give you  
Anything you want in this whole wide world  
Mama gives you money for Sunday school  
You trade yours for candy after church is through  
  
[Verse:]  
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)  
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall  
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right  
But while you were doing it-it sure felt outta sight

To a far away city  
Trying hard to forget abou-out you

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all.  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her  
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so  
She just didn't know I would really go.

As something comes into her mind  
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood  
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
The photograph album she takes from the closet  
And slowly turns the page  
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower  
The first one he gave her now withered today  
  
She closes her eyes and  
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears  
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown  
That broke all their minds back so many years

Told of the lawmen left dying or dead  
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame  
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game  
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day  
Their odds growing smaller with each get-away  
The end getting closer the harder they fought  
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught  
  
They drove back from town on one bright summer day  
When a man they be-friended stepped out in the way  
With no thought of dying they both took his side  
But the death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde  
Now two years of running was ended that day  
For robbing and killing they both had to pay  
We'll always remember how they lived and died

Two heart's become one with a love like that

I was head over heels in junior high  
And it lasted a week or two  
When my heart was destroyed I cried and cried  
'Til I found me somebody new  
  
Life without a real love is tragedy  
That's why I'm gonna find a love that's right for me  
I've gotta look beyond what my eyes can see  
Until my dreams are reality  
  
There's gotta be more to fallin' in love  
Than fallin' away when the stayin' gets tough

And if time could heal the wounds  
I would tear the threads away  
That I might bleed some more

Her laughter was the steeple bells  
That ring to greet the morning sun  
A voice that called to everyone  
To love the ground we walked upon  
Those were good days  
The last time I held her hand  
Her touch was autumn spring  
And summer and winter too  
The last time I let go of her  
She walked away into the night  
I lost her in the misty streets  
A thousand months, a thousand years  
When other lips will kiss her eyes  
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is  
The last time I saw her face  
Her eyes were bathed in starlight  
And she walked alone  
The last time she kissed my cheek

Upon the autumn covered hills  
Resting on the frozen ground  
The seeds of love lie cold and still  
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten

Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for  
And here we stand in a box of sand  
Where's the playground Susie?  
  
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
The carousel has stopped us here  
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here  
And still you're not content with something about me  
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me  
To take your hand ?  
How would you stand?  
  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around?  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
Where's the playground Susie?

Afraid that I'll discover  
What in your heart you know, is meant to be  
Darlin' if you want it to be me  
To be the one to say, I want you  
Then I'm telling you now  
Gonna find a way somehow, to be your lover  
And spend the whole night making love  
Then find it's never enough  
Just think what we are giving up  
Every day that we're not lovers  
Few times in our lives can we feel this way  
It would be a shame just to throw it away

Gloria Estefan,I'm Not Giving Up,/g/gloria+estefan/im+not+giving+up_20800580.html,"To be completely honest  
It scares me to imagine  
What life would be without you  
  
And for this very reason  
I ask you to forgive me  
For what I'm putting us through  
  
Although there are so many things  
Against us, I've decided  
That I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Thinking back, I see what we have  
Is something different  
I think we've known all along  
So how fair would it be  
To divide this love's existence  
Between what's right and what's wrong  
  
And you, always wondering if we'll make it  
Time will tell you  
That I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
I'm not giving you up, no  
No I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken  
Come back to haunt me, false and broken  
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever  
Searching for water in the desert  
  
No, I refuse to have to do  
Without your kisses  
I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever

He almost makes the day begin

To the tune that he whistles night and noon  
  
His smiles, his frowns  
His ups, his downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
I was serenely independent  
And content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again  
And yet, I've grown accustomed to his look  
  
Accustomed to his voice  
Accustomed to his face  
I'm so used to hearing him say  
""Good morning,"" every day  
  
His joys, his woes  
His highs, his lows  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break  
And yet, I've grown accustomed  
To the trace of something in the air

With your eyes  
Oh, and the way your body moves

Release me from this state of mind

Just a prisoner of love

Go on and close the door on me  
  
Oh, I've been convicted for the crime  
I have been done  
But if losing you is my sentence  
I'd rather lose my life  
Can someone help me  
Help me keep my sanity

That's taking over me

Before I fall too fast  
Baby you should know  
I need love that's gonna last  
You gotta promise to be here  
Through the laughter and the tears  
Lemme know that you're mine  
Everyday, every night ?cause  
  
There's just no other way to love me  
Take my heart  
Take my soul  
Baby never let me go  
No, there's just no other way to love me  
That's the way  
It should be  
If you're gonna fall in love with me  
?Cause there's just no other way to love me  
  
Let me show you how much I care  
And baby I swear  
I'll be right there when you need me  
But I gotta know  
That you'll always be true  
That you're gonna see this through  
And give your heart completely  
  
I wanna feel it when we kiss  
Believe it when we touch  
Don't just say you love  
?Cause words are not enough  
I wanna see it in your eyes  
Believe it deep inside  
I gotta know you'll be here  
Every day, every night  
  
I will never ask for mere that I'll give to you  
Gonna give my everything  
But I gotta know that your heart is true  
Everyday, everyday  
Every night, every night  
For the rest of my life

Their watch of wondering love

Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Oh night divine

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,  
Let all within us praise His holy name.

As our hearts join one more time  
Misunderstanding we could live behind  
Don't you think it ain't true  
I'm gonna keep on loving you  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again and again and again, baby  
Now you say it's the end  
Oh, but I think we can start over again  
Just to think of the time  
We were mellowed by spices of love  
Let's not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all the time in the world to live it again  
Baby, we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again

Are you listening?  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun  
With Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When it's cold  
Ain't it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland

Gloria Gaynor,You're All I Need To Get By,/g/gloria+gaynor/youre+all+i+need+to+get+by_20499416.html,"When I was just a little girl  
I wanted the world at my feet  
Now all that's changed  
Cause I have loved and  
Now I do concede  
(You're all I need to get by)  
(You're all I need to get by)  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you,  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
I'll sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life to you  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when you lose your will  
I'll be there to push you up the hill  
There's no  
No looking back for us  
We got love sure enough  
That's enough  
You're all  
You're all I need to get by  
Like an eagle protects his nest  
For you I'll do my best  
Stand by you like a tree  
Dare anybody to try and move me  
Darling in you I found  
Strength where I was torn down  
Don't know what's in store  
But together we can open any door  
Just to do what's good for you  
And inspire you a little higher  
I know you can make a woman  
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal  
Cause we, we got the right foundation  
And with love and determination  
You're all, You're All I need to get by.  
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more  
All the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
You're all  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
All I need to get by...  
All I need is you...

Gordon Lightfoot,A Message To The Wind,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+message+to+the+wind_20061694.html,"I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I don't know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If there's is a reason you might try and forget  
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew  
Another lonely night with you could never be  
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real  
All that you can ever do when love is reveal  
Sometimes I every try why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?

Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around

In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  
Then left with the answer I've never found yet  
""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone?""

To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die  
Trapped within the circle time parade

Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
For when the morning breaks  
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn

Passions will part to a warm melody  
As fires will sometimes turn cold  
Like petals in the wind  
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls

To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside  
But I was young and able  
When I came out the other end  
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble  
Unreadable  
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go  
I thanked him  
A face of white, a face of brown  
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger  
For a stranger  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York

A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me""  
I came down to live alone in New York  
The city of the living  
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men  
Were taking, none we giving  
Or forgiving  
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  
I saw them  
There were men who lived in style and others who had died  
Where no one knew them  
Beause they couldn't win  
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  
Where babies crept unwanted  
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope  
Or if it mattered what they did  
Or if they lived

I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me

I looked across the river to the city

And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""  
There were lovers in the park  
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it  
So afraid of it  
And there were preachers of the Word and poets  
Who were never heard, I heard them  
There were those who would not try to learn  
The measure of the lie they're livin'  
I heard a young musician play in a place  
Where they paid you not to listen  
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  
And offered their best wishes

Happy just to see my day's work done

And I worked the Quebec mines  
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines  
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds

You have a man in the West  
Does your mother know  
You drove him from your door  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
Does your mother know  
You walked all day in the rain  
Does your mother know  
How deep your love could be  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That you've got ten dollars  
And your rent costs eight  
And when you get straight  
You're gonna come back east some day  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her

Gordon Lightfoot,Don Quixote,/g/gordon+lightfoot/don+quixote_20061548.html,"Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a battered book into his hand  
Standing like a prophet bold  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
I have come o'er moor and mountain  
Like the hawk upon the wing  
I was once a shining knight  
Who was the guardian of a king  
I have searched the whole world over  
Looking for a place to sleep  
I have seen the strong survive  
And I have seen the lean grown weak  
  
See the children of the earth  
Who wake to find the table bare  
See the gentry in the country  
Riding off to take the air  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a rusty sword into his hand  
Then striking up a knightly pose  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
See the jailor with his key  
Who locks away all trace of sin  
See the judge upon the bench  
Who tries the case as best he can  
See the wise and wicked ones  
Who feed upon life's sacred fire  
See the soldier with his gun  
Who must be dead to be admired  
  
See the man who tips the needle  
See the man who buys and sells  
See the man who puts the collar  
On the ones who dare not tell  
See the drunkard in the tavern  
Stemming gold to make ends meet  
See the youth in ghetto black  
Condemned to life upon the street  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand  
Then standing like a preacher now  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves  
He gallops off across the dusty plain  
In vain to search again  
Where no one will hear  
  
Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek

And my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way

In the early mornin' rain

They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on

Or just another patron with a smile?  
Let me analyze you, are you a flame  
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?

And the wine was runnin' low  
And the old man came home  
From the forest  
  
His tears fell on the sidewalk  
As he stumbled in the street  
A dozen faces stopped to stare  
But no one stopped to speak  
For his castle was a hallway  
And the bottle was his friend  
And the old man stumbled in

Up a dark and dingy staircase  
The old man made his way  
His ragged coat around him  
As upon his cot he lay  
And he wondered how it happened  
That he ended up this way  
Getting lost like a fool  
In the forest  
  
And as he lay there sleeping  
A vision did appear  
Upon his mantle shining  
A face of one so dear  
Who had loved him in the springtime  
Of a long-forgotten year  
When the wildflowers did bloom  
In the forest  
  
She touched his grizzled fingers  
And she called him by his name  
And then he heard the joyful sound  
Of children at their games  
In an old house on a hillside  
In some forgotten town  
Where the river runs down  
From the forest  
  
With a mighty roar the big jets soar  
Above the canyon streets  
And the con men con but life goes on  
For the city never sleeps  
And to an old forgotten soldier  
The dawn will come no more

I want to hear it from you  
Let me know how you feel  
You've got to make up your mind  
Tell me where I can run  
When my roof tumbles in  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you

Didn't lie when he said to us  
I seen the high rollers come and go  
It's the holy rollers I trust  
The man said then he was sixteen when  
He retired from the county school  
A wee bit thin with a will to begin  
He was known to be know man's fool

The one man band was a mighty good man  
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn  
He ups and downs about four more rounds  
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home  
It seemed to me like he never could be  
Like anything I'd ever seen before  
When he stepped from the stage  
With his ax in his hand  
And he run through the backstage door

No one knows your name

We've got to find each other now  
That is how we can learn all about the other man's song  
On the plains of abraham  
When they sent the lamb to die  
You and I were asleep in the rock of ages  
Remember the unborn children still to come  
If you need me and I need you  
There's nothin' else needs sayin'  
Understand it  
I'm not too deaf to hear the song you're playin'  
Nous vivons ensemble  
Nous nous connaissons maintenant  
Voici comment nous pouvons decouvrir une autre humanite  
Sur les plaines d'abraham  
Lors do dernier sacrifice  
Toi et moi nous dormions tres loin dans le temp  
Souviens toi des enfants qui attendant encore  
Si tu me veux je serai la see'est tout ce que j'ai a dire  
Car comprend moi  
Je ne suis pas sourd a la musique que tu joues

Gordon Lightfoot,Now And Then,/g/gordon+lightfoot/now+then_20061527.html,"I think this time you've said enough  
To make me want to leave this place  
Still I keep coming back for more of  
The same to fan the dying flame  
Here inside these walls that seem  
To move a little closer every day  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then  
  
I think this time that was the best time  
That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Take away the in-between  
Think about the good things now and then  
We will see the day when you  
Or I will stay or face up to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
And think about the good things now and then

Gordon Lightfoot,Ode To Big Blue,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ode+to+big+blue_20061550.html,"The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends, it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

And thank her for the favors that she gave  
A stranger I came  
My head bowed in the rain to her door

Buyin' kingdoms with my songs  
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while  
Warm in the sunlight of her smile

I catch myself just looking back  
Reliving all the wonder of those nights

Gordon Lightfoot,Romance,/g/gordon+lightfoot/romance_20061623.html,"You said you were through with romance  
Why take a chance on anyone  
You're so beautiful too  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't change  
Why rear range the original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
Signs of a new beginning  
Signs of a life worth living  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe someday things will change  
And come with in range and be laughable  
Everything is okay  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't try  
That's just a lie, they work miracles  
It's a gift from above  
When we talk about love and romance  
Signs of a new tomorrow  
Signs of a life without sorrow  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe this time you will be  
Romantic like me when I'm with you  
And I think you might say  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't change  
Like 'Home On The Range', it's original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
You do something to me  
When we talk about love and romance

But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done  
And the gentle sweet reminder of a daughter and a son  
  
Sitting alone, my friends have all gone home  
You never know when they'll come droppin' in  
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls  
Too young to understand how love begins

Where that river runs away  
From the mountains in the spring time  
On a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around  
As the shades of night grow deep  
When the morning stars grow dim  
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep

Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone

With all of these false emotions  
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just  
Being alone, she's not the same  
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame  
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain

I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend  
Don't look now, she's right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside

She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you

Anytime is the right time  
To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night  
  
Ah, the loving ain't easy  
I let it get the best of me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she don't talk no more

In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay

Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart

Was the easiest thing that I ever could do

Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win

No need to criticize

Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss

To the night and the empty skies my love

The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth turn in my hand  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command my love  
That was there at my command  
  
The first time ever I lay with you  
And felt your heart beat close to mine  
I thought our joy would fill the earth  
And would last 'till the end of time my love

Gordon Lightfoot,The Gypsy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/the+gypsy_20061518.html,"Step inside my tent, said she, ""I'd like to read you palm""  
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long  
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind  
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake  
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date  
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot  
You were told when you should speak and when you should not  
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night  
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake  
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said  
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get  
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then she spoke most quietly

his country.

What he didn't know, is that some day his tribe would be dying.

Winter is coming and it's plain to see  
I spend the cold nights in my lonely room  
Is it the winter to which I am doomed?  
Cold is the snow that will cover the ground  
I feel the presence of tears falling down  
Is it for pity or vain that I cry?  
Color is gone and the grass it must die  
Winter brings sadness that empties my soul  
Life is too short for a dog growing old  
He used to follow and play at my heel  
Love from his heart I no longer can feel

Teeth big and pointed and his eyes were bugging out  
Contact the union, put the beggars to route  
Screaming and yelling and licking his chops  
He never runs he just stumbles and hops  
Just out of prison on six dollars bail  
Mumbling at bitches and wagging his tail

Moving with a pinch of grace  
You may be a clown in the burying ground

Honest to the point of recklessness  
Self-centred to the extreme

Loose with the truth, maybe its your fire  
Baby I hope you don't get burned

And a little sympathy  
  
There are things you can replace  
And others you cannot  
The time has come to weigh those things  
This space is gettin' hot

That I was born to be a bachelor

Thinking a lot about less and less  
And forgetting the love we bring

Or leave it if you dare  
But it's just a box of rain  
Or a ribbon for your hair  
Such a long long time to be gone  
And a short time to be there

Fare you well my only true one  
All the birds that were singing  
Have flown except you alone  
  
Going to leave this broke-down palace  
On my hands and my knees I will roll roll roll  
Make myself a bed by the waterside  
In my time, in my time, I will roll roll roll  
  
In a bed, in a bed  
By the waterside I will lay my head  
Listen to the river sing sweet songs  
To rock my soul  
  
River gonna take me  
Sing me sweet and sleepy  
Sing me sweet and sleepy  
All the way back back home  
It's a far gone lullaby  
Sung many years ago  
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come  
Since I first left home  
  
Going home, going home  
By the waterside I will rest my bones  
Listen to the river sing sweet songs  
To rock my soul  
  
Going to plant a weeping willow  
On the banks green edge it will grow grow grow  
Sing a lullaby beside the water  
Lovers come and go, the river roll roll roll  
  
Fare you well, fare you well  
I love you more than words can tell

To rock my soul

Grateful Dead,Brother Esau,/g/grateful+dead/brother+esau_20161391.html,"My brother Esau killed the hunter, back in 1969,  
Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine.  
When at first my brother walked away,  
Before a weary band,  
Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land.  
Our father favored Esau, he was eager to obey,  
All the wild commandments, the old man shot his way.  
But all this ended when, my brother failed at war,  
He staggered home and found me in the door.  
Esau he's on rollerskates today,  
And he make a statement to someone in L. A.  
Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,  
Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.  
Esau holds the blessing, brother Esau holds the curse,  
I was thinking that the blame was mine,  
But suspected something worse.  
The more my brother looks like me, the more I understand,  
The silent war it bloodied both our hands.  
None of us can win.  
Outside that dream, still that hairy man.  
Well sometimes at night I think I understand.  
Shadowboxing the apocalypse, wandering the land

And little wings like a vampire bat,

To tell me to got off with this trip,  
The say its like a sinking ship,  
Life is sweet it's too warm to sip,  
And if I drink I'll chuck and flip, I'll just say as I take a nip,  
Oh I dream of cotton seas and granite walls and redwood trees,  
And ugly eye that only sees endless mirrors and infinite me's,  
About the winter's coming freeze this afterthought I say with ease,

The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the ground.  
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.  
  
I sat down to my supper, 'twas a bottle of red whisky,  
I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me.  
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.  
  
When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin,  
Was grinning at my window, all I said was ""Come on in"".  
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.  
  
The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game.  
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades, but the cards were all the same.  
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.  
  
In the backwash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire,  
The Dire Wolf collects his dues, while the boys sing 'round the fire.  
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.  
No, no, no don't murder me. I beg of you,  
Don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

Why, why tell me, what's your why now?  
Tell me why will you never come home?  
Tell me what's your reason if you got a good one  
  
Everywhere I go

Everyone's doin' that rag  
  
Take my line go fishing for a Tuesday  
Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea  
Gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons  
Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three  
  
Rain gonna come but the rain gonna go, you know  
Stepping off sharply from the rank and file  
Awful cold and dark like a dungeon  
Maybe get a little bit darker 'fore the day  
  
Hipsters, tripsters,  
Real cool chicks, sir,  
Everyone's doin' that rag  
  
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset  
No one is watching or standing in your shoes  
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning  
Everything promised is delivered to you  
  
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is  
All the winter birds are winging home now  
Hey Love, go and look around you  
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now  
  
But you can wade in the water  
And never get wet  
If you keep on doin' that rag  
  
One eyed jacks and the deuces are wild  
The aces are crawling up and down your sleeve  
Come back here, Baby Louise,  
And tell me the name  
Of the game that you play  
  
Is it all fall down?  
Is it all go under?  
Is it all fall down, down, down  
Is it all go under?

But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow  
And where the whiskey it was boss and the women they were fine  
Well now there she goes my friend, she's a'rolling down the line  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time  
This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me

The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own  
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings  
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings, and songs of its own  
  
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away  
There follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay  
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay  
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day.

Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home  
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone

Mama came quick with the water witch spell

Another chase of rags to riches, I learned to throw some fancy pitches.  
I found out what ain't and which is just exactly cool, well all right  
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool  
Got a place in Malibu like you never seen  
Picking out your lady friend from Penthouse magazine  
You oughta see the chrome gleam on my Mercedes all shiny and new  
Hey, I'm the Jack of Diamonds, the boy with all the clues  
Not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me).  
Ooh, I'm a hyper-supervisor, fast driver, star driver (fool).  
Heaven help the fool, professional ""gimme-fiver"", heaven help the fool.  
Anything you could want to be you can buy, even get it free  
Make yourself a smoother dancer, fill your head with answers.  
Never a backward glancer, it's you who makes the rules (aah).  
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool  
No, no, never a backward glancer, (fool), heaven help the fool.  
I meet alot of pentagram, heart of the star (that's what you are)  
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar  
Ooh, not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)  
And when they offer golden apples, are you sure you'll refuse?

She is not to blame  
  
Poised for flight  
Wings spread bright  
Spring from night  
Into the sun  
Don't stop to run  
She can fly like a lie  
She cannot be outdone

I can pay  
Let me go  
Tell me love is not lost  
Sell everything  
Without love, day to day,  
Insanity is king  
  
I will pay  
Day by day  
Anyway  
Lock, bolt and key  
Crippled but free

I was learning to see  
  
Help on the way  
I know only this  
I've got you today  
Don't fly away  
'Cause I love what I love  
And I want it that way

See if he could come back holdin' 29 keys of Gold.  
Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed  
And it isn't any better if you haven't any weed.  
Henry struggled to hold it straight on twisty mountain roads  
Fifty people waitin' back in hopes for Henry's load.

Now he's rolling down the mountain goin' fast, fast, fast  
And if he blows it this one's going to be his last  
Run to Acapulco to turn the Golden Key  
Henry keeps the brakes on for this corner if you please.  
Henry got to Mexico and he turned his truck around  
Talkin' with the man who has it growin' from the ground  
Henry tasted, he got wasted, couldn't even see  
How he's going to drive like that it's not clear to me.  
Chorus  
Sunday afternoon, Tihajuana is a lovely town  
Bullfight brings the tourist in, their money flowing down  
Border guards are much too busy there at 5 o'clock

Dug for him a shallow grave  
And laid his body down  
  
Half a mile from Tucson  
By the morning light  
One man gone and another to go  
My old buddy you're moving much too slow  
  
We can share the women  
We can share the wine

Grateful Dead,Joey,/g/grateful+dead/joey_20631146.html,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when  
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion  
Always on the outside of whatever side there was  
When they asked him why it had to be that way, ""Well,"" he answered, ""just  
Because. ""  
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.  
They called Joe ""Crazy,"" the baby they called ""Kid Blast.""  
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too.  
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.  
Joey, Joey,  
King of the streets, child of clay.  
Joey, Joey,  
What made them want to come and blow you away?  
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that  
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.  
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.  
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.  
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets  
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats  
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.  
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.  
The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim,  
""Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame.""  
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, ""We're not those kind of men.  
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again. ""  
Joey, Joey,  
King of the streets, child of clay.  
Joey, Joey,  
What made them want to come and blow you away?  
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith  
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.  
""What time is it?"" said the judge to Joey when they met  
""Five to ten,"" said Joey. The judge says, ""That's exactly what you get.""  
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich  
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike.  
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand  
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.  
When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight  
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.  
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind  
To the boss he said, ""I have returned and now I want what's mine.""  
Joey, Joey,  
King of the streets, child of clay.  
Joey, Joey,  
Why did they have to come and blow you away?  
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun  
""I'm around too many children,"" he'd say, ""they should never know of one.""  
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,  
Emptied out the register, said, ""Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe.""  
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York  
He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork.  
He pushed the table over to protect his family  
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.  
Joey, Joey,  
King of the streets, child of clay.  
Joey, Joey,  
What made them want to come and blow you away?  
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.  
I heard his best friend Frankie say, ""He ain't dead, he's just asleep.""  
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave  
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.  
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned  
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.  
And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve  
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.  
Joey, Joey,  
King of the streets, child of clay.  
Joey, Joey,  
What made them want to come and blow you away?

Grateful Dead,Just A Little Light,/g/grateful+dead/just+a+little+light_20062335.html,"Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care.  
And it isn't even lonely when no one's ever there.  
I had a lot of dreams once, but some of them came true,  
The honey's sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you.  
  
So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.  
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise all right.  
But here you're trembling like a sparrow, I will try with all my might  
To give you just a little sweetness,  
Just a little sweetness,  
Just a little light.  
  
I have always heard that virtue ought be its own reward,  
But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword.  
It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way.  
You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away.  
  
Even though I been a stranger, full of irony and spite  
Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright,  
Something shines around you and it seems, to my delight  
To give me just a little sweetness,  
Just a little sweetness,  
Just a little sweetness,  
Just a little light.  
  
This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night.  
You could be just another white-tail, baby, stranded on my brights,  
There's a tingling recognition  
Like the sound of distant thunder  
And I begin to wonder  
If the love I've driven under  
Won't ignite.  
  
So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.  
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise all right.

Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door.  
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea.  
  
She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter,  
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water, and  
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.  
  
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear.  
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field,  
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal,  
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring,  
Black dirt live again!  
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,  
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing  
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing  
  
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.  
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name,  
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.  
Water bright as the sky from which it came,  
And the name is on the earth that takes it in.  
We will not speak but stand inside the rain,  
And listen to the thunder shouting ""i am! i am! i am! i am.""  
  
Nothin' more, the love of the women, work of men.  
Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down as we rise and fall.

And you know it was the hottest part of the day  
  
I took the horses up to the stall  
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all  
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt  
It being summer, I took off my shirt  
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt  
  
West Texas cowboys, they was all around,  
Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,  
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,  
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,  
Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.  
  
My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,  
One of them called him, and then two more,  
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,  
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,  
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.  
  
One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,  
And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,  
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,  
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,  
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.  
  
Now I love thoe cowboys, I love their gold,  
Love my uncle, God rest his soul,  
Taught me good Lord, Taught me all I know,  
Taught me so well, that I grabbed that gold, and  
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

Grateful Dead,Mexicali Blues,/g/grateful+dead/mexicali+blues_20062448.html,"Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand,  
Watchin' flies and children on the street,  
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile,  
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.  
  
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came.  
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.  
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen,  
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!  
  
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,  
When the devil wants to take it all away?  
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze,  
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.  
  
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town.  
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell.  
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,  
All the french perfume you'd care to smell.  
  
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear,  
""Go on, my friend, do anything you choose.""  
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms,  
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues.  
  
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,  
When the devil wants to take it all away?  
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze  
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.  
  
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law.  
Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.  
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun,  
I'd have no one but myself to blame.  
  
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind.  
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news  
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw  
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues.  
  
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose  
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?  
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark  
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.

Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around  
And the rain fallin' down but I never know  
Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends

When that wind blows when the night's about to fall

Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues  
Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through  
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do  
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine  
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose  
Never know now, just don't never know, no  
Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end  
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'  
And I'm as good as gone again  
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance  
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance

We'll gather with the other Fools  
And put on a proper show  
So here's to the Poorest Poet  
Who always pens the truth  
Players Writers and Gypsies  
The Minstrels and their tunes  
I'd rather live an honest lifetime  
With those with nothing to lose  
Than waste a night  
Knee deep in shite

Great Big Sea,Concerning Charlie Horse,/g/great+big+sea/concerning+charlie+horse_20537982.html,"Come all ye friends, I'll sit you down  
And sing an oleful ditty  
T'was on a day in April month  
We started from the city  
We planned a day or two at Mahers  
We stalwart men were chosen  
To remove old Charlie from Angle Pond  
Who fell in when the pond was frozen  
  
We seven men came roaring down  
On the road to Roaches Line  
We might have stopped in Avondale  
Or Brigus might have been fine  
We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in  
Nor took any time to park us  
We all of us knew that we must get through  
To remove old Charlie's carcass  
  
[Chorus]  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
Here's to Shave the Master  
No better horse ne'er ran the course  
Nor pulled the logs more faster  
Here's to Charlie Horse  
And I want ye all to know  
Charlie's gone to the big corral  
Where all good horses go  
  
In the car was Ol' Pocket Comb  
And beside him Old Moose Coosten  
And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark  
In the back seat he was roostin'  
There was Smiley Stubborn and the Mounted Police  
It wasn't hard to find him  
And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam  
Was sitting right in beside him  
Kevin and Buck was also there  
But they brought some brawn and brains  
They was aiming to help as best they could  
To remove old Chuck's remains  
Charlie was like a brother to Shave  
And he loved him well of course  
Charlie was a very good man you see  
Although he'd been a horse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'll spare you all the gruesome details  
And just relate the end  
With two stout doors and a few strong ropes  
We removed old Shady's friend  
We gave him a decent sendoff  
With all our hats removed  
So long as we helped old Shave and his friend  
Our loyalty was proved  
Somewhere up in the great beyond  
His eyes are shining bright  
Charlie nods an approving nod  
'Cause he knows we did him right  
Shave will join him there one day  
And he'll bring the harness leather  
And so for all of eternity  
They'll pull the logs together

We were proud of our trade, and in us it did show  
We held our heads high, there was lots of fish then  
That was the time, when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster, we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled, we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people, will we ere be again?

Abused and mis-managed, oh what can we do?  
I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,  
How will they know that we weren't the ones?

Of our beautiful ocean, from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers, they tore up our twine  
Politians don't care for what's yours or what's mine!

Shove the package to hell, go back to the sea

And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay

You and I could wait and see  
A single note don't make a melody  
All together you and me

The one thing that's been weighing on my mind

Dear Granny, there's mummers, there's twenty or more.  
Her old weathered face lightens up with a grin.  
Any mummers, nice mummers 'lowed in?  
  
Ah, come in lovely mummers, don't bother the snow,  
We'll wipe up the water sure after you go.  
And sit if you can upon some mummer's knee.  
We'll see if we knows who ye be.  
  
Ah, there's big ones and small ones, tall ones and thin,  
There's boys dressed as women and girls dressed as men,  
With humps on their backs and mitts on their feet,  
My blessed we'll die with the heat.  
  
Well, there's only one here that I think that I know,  
That tall fellow standing alongside the stove.  
He's shaking his fist for to make me not tell.  
Must be Willy from out on the hill.  
  
Ah, but that one's a stranger, if ever was one  
With his underwear stuffed and his trapdoor undone.  
Is he wearing his mother's big forty-two bra?  
I knows, but I'm not going to say.  
  
Well, I suppose you fine mummers would turn down a drop  
Of home brew or alky, whatever you got.  
That one with his rubber boots on the wrong feet  
Ate enough for to do him all week.  
  
Now I suppose you can dance? Sure they all nod their heads.  
They've been tapping their feet ever since they came in.  
And now that the drinks have been all passed around,  
Sure the mummers are plankin' 'er down.  
  
(Instrumental break - Bob plays one verse of Deck the Halls on the fiddle)  
  
Ah, be careful the lamp! Now hold on to the stove.  
Don't you swing Granny hard, 'cause you know that she's old.  
And never you mind how you buckles the floor  
'Cause the mummers have danced here before.  
  
Oh my God, how hot is it? We'll never know.  
Allows that we'll all get the devil's own cold.  
Good night and good Christmas, mummers me dears  
Please God, we will see you next year

Great Big Sea,Tickle Cove Pond,/g/great+big+sea/tickle+cove+pond_20537977.html,"In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow  
We're up against troubles that few people know  
It's only by courage and patience and grit  
And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit  
The hard and the easy we take as they come  
And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs  
To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on  
I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
I knew that the ice grew weaker each day  
But still took the risk and kept haulin' away  
One evening in April, bound home with a load  
My mare showed some halting against the ice road  
She knew more than I did as matters turned out  
Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt  
She turned round her head with tears in her eyes  
As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives  
  
All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow  
For man is a stupid dumb creature you know  
And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh  
And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice  
I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice  
Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone  
I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond  
  
I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile  
And neighbors showed up in a very short while  
You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites  
To render assistance in all your bad plights  
To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives  
The same can be said for their children and wives  
And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast  
William White for a shanty song made a request  
There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay  
Straight from his heart came this song right away  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might

Now love is grand, when love is new  
The heart blood, it runs strong  
There's nothing a doting lad won't do  
To keep his princess warm

He'll ask her out to dance  
He'll cajole and he'll beg  
And he'll always win

It makes the strongest tree to bend

Time brings all things to an end.

His eyes begin to roam  
He forgets all about the brown-eyed beauty  
Who now, sits home alone  
  
There's no more walks, down lover's lane  
There's no more wine in the sun  
All that's left is a hollow pain  
Time, alas you've won

And last your whole life through  
Keep ahead of time me boys

Green Day,80,/g/green+day/80_20062721.html,"My mental stability reaches its bitter end  
And all my senses are coming unglued  
Is there any cure for this disease  
Someone called love  
Not as long as there are  
Girls like you  
  
Everything she does questions my mental health  
It makes me loose control  
I just can't trust myself  
  
If someone can hear me slap some sense in me  
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself  
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated  
So I loose my head or bang it up against the wall  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone  
And lock myself up in a padded room  
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air  
No one wants to hear a drunken fool  
  
I do not mind if this goes on  
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone  
I must admit I enjoy myself  
Eighty please keep taking me away

Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change  
  
Or will I grow that old?  
Will I still be around?  
The way I carry on I'll end up  
Six feet underground  
And waste away...

Did the golden rule make him go crazy  
Or did he hide away from hopes  
Behind a smile and smoking dope  
It's crazy

Time passes by like lightning  
Before you know it you're struck down  
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions

Green Day,Carpe Diem,/g/green+day/carpe+diem_20988159.html,"Breaking in a sweat  
Like a bomb threat  
Is your silhouette fading out?  
Nothing left to lose  
Detonate the fuse  
Another breaking news blowout  
  
Ain't it beautiful?  
So unusual  
Life's a gas and it's running out  
Living a cliche  
Gonna seize the day  
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
The blink of an eye  
Barely scraping by  
Dominated by passer by's  
Feeling out of luck  
When the traffic's stuck  
And you're feeling  
So left behind  
  
Getting off a binge  
Get a second wind  
Another promise  
Just make a change  
Got a Broken wing  
Hear the angels sing  
With a signal that's out of range  
Ain't it strange?  
Ain't it strange?

It didn't say much but it only confirmed  
That the center of the earth is the end of the world

I thought before I was  
And I can't get it figured out  
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers  
Screaming my memories  
As if I was never there  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Im like a punk rocker on labor day  
How the hell did I work so hard  
To be born this way?  
I never learned to read or write so well  
But I can play the guitar  
Until it hurts like hell  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
  
From the edge of the world

I want a better way to die  
If this is what you call the good life  
I want a better way to die  
  
Oh, I dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Dont wanna think about this road  
It doesnt matter anyway  
I wanna start a revolution  
I wanna hear it on my radio  
Ill put it off another day  
I want a new conspiricy  
And the silence of a thousand cries  
So hurry up  
I want a better way to die  
  
Im running late to Somewhere Now  
I dont want to be  
Where the future and promises  
Ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise  
Or bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side  
Ever get so full  
  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about the road  
Somewhere now  
Oh I wanna start a revolution

Before he's a creep in the past  
And you're alone once again?  
Will you pop up again  
And be my special friend  
'Till the end?

Soda Pop and Ritalin  
No one ever died for my  
Sins in hell  
As far as I can tell  
At least the ones that I got away with  
  
And there's nothing wrong with me  
This is how I'm supposed to be  
In a land of make believe  
That don't believe in me  
  
Get my television fix  
Sitting on my crucifix  
The living room in my private womb  
While the Moms and brats are away  
To fall in love and fall in debt  
To alcohol and cigarettes  
And Mary Jane  
To keep me insane  
Doing someone else's cocaine  
  
And there's nothing wrong with me  
This is how I'm supposed to be  
In a land of make believe  
That don't believe in me  
  
At the center of the earth  
In the parking lot  
Of the 7-11 where I was taught  
The motto was just a lie  
  
It says home is where your heart is  
But what a shame  
Cause everyone's heart  
Doesn't beat the same  
It's beating out of time  
  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today

In the bathroom stall  
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall  
And so it seemed to confess  
  
It didn't say much  
But it only confirmed that  
The center of the earth  
Is the end of the world  
And I could really care less  
  
City of the dead

Signs misleading to nowhere

I don't care if you don't care

Everyone's so full of shit  
Born and raised by hypocrites  
Hearts recycled but never saved  
From the cradle to the grave  
We are the kids of war and peace  
From Anaheim to the Middle East  
We are the stories and disciples of  
The Jesus of suburbia  
  
Land of make believe

Land of make believe  
And I don't believe  
And I don't care!  
  
Dearly beloved are you listening?  
I can't remember a word that you were saying  
Are we demented or am I disturbed?  
The space that's in between insane and insecure  
  
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?  
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed  
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused  
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse  
  
To live, and not to breathe  
Is to die, in tragedy  
To run, to run away  
To find, what you believe  
  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
I lost my faith to this  
This town that don't exist  
So I run, I run away  
To the lights of masochists  
  
And I, leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
And I, walked this line  
A million and one fucking times  
But not this time  
  
I don't feel any shame  
I wont apologize  
When there ain't nowhere you can go  
Running away from pain  
When you've been victimized  
Tales from another broken home  
  
Oh you're leaving  
You're leaving  
You're leaving  
Are you leaving home?

A stab in the back.

Nail me to the cross until you have won.

Bleeding down these thoughts of  
Anguish... mass confusion  
The world is a sick machine  
Breeding a mass of shit  
With such a desolate conclusion  
Fill the void with... I don't care  
There's a plague inside of me  
Eating at my disposition  
Nothing's left  
Torn out of reality  
Into a state of no opinion  
Limp with hate

Those days are gone, and now it seems  
As if I'll get some rest

And it puts my heart to the test

We are only friends  
To this day I'm asking why  
I still think about you

Just a friend to you  
But all I want to know right now  
Is if you think about me too

Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise and bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side ever get so dull?  
  
I've grown up and am medicated  
On my own Cellular waves  
I put the riot in Patriot  
And we all die in threes  
I got a scene in the middle of the road  
Im gonna take my time  
I shop online so I can vote  
At the speed of life

There's a soldier thats freaking out  
Because this is war!

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Raised in the city under a halo of lights  
  
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

My phantom was seen on candler  
You ride the transit  
No options you niggas can't act like y'all forgot this I'm tired  
But switch ya flow up it's so monotonous it's my metropolis

My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip  
I'm the nigga upload your twitter bitch I'm the topic  
Profess it but  
Gucci didn't graduate from college  
Your girlfriend say's my ear rings are erotic  
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic it's Gucci  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room it's like Atlanta zoo  
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
I'm a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too  
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (Gucci)  
  
Drop beam  
Off set things color ice cream  
White dreams  
She can fuck me that's a pipe dream  
S-O poppin' x-pills so exciting  
My ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited  
Cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted  
The waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix  
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n' Asian  
On 20 headed to buckhead I'm racing baby  
But take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey  
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken  
Real n you nigga's really really good at faken

Whole key, half a key, quarter key  
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' jukebox  
Pop-pop hear the glock cock  
And I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D  
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank  
That shape like Tennessee (ugh!)  
I cut ya  
I cut ya til the white meat  
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat  
I smoke the best I get my dro' from California  
Get high n go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma  
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma  
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a doner

And if you got a tilt ya car get peelt

I'm a beat it up  
He can lay you down  
But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
  
I hopped up out my bed  
Got my swag on  
Stronger than fillet Mignon  
Two Gs blown just for cologne  
Money never limited  
So Icey with benefits  
My driver needs a passport  
All my cars are immigrants!  
It's so sickening  
History you're witnessing  
I had a girl she quit me  
Now I'm single want to get with me?  
Sticky again they stick to me  
If you see your chick with GUCCI  
Think before you confronting ruley  
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'  
430 stepped on purp it  
08 verty rollin' dirty  
Wardrobe clean as this detergent  
Got your girlfriend picking purses  
Say she lonely  
Gucci only one with to meet me in person  
When she met me home  
My bitch told me that shes over first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your girlfriend keep callin' me  
I feel like she stalkin' me  
You at home  
And she with me  
So morning it's an argument  
Gucci Mane be doggin' it  
Beatin' her down  
Straight poundin' it  
Drillin' on your sheets  
Got your blanket at the laundromat  
Wait baby girl throw it back  
Old man might catch heart attack  
Gucci Mane not hardly that  
Smack you like I'm mad at that  
Swear this sex so passionate  
Oral sex she mastered that  
Pornographic poses  
Like she posing for the internet  
Wait I was not finished yet  
Never been a minute man  
Always been a business man  
Gotta catch your feelings man  
Got a man?  
Oh really now?  
Acting like I give a damn!  
  
Used to like her now I don't  
Got a real short attention span  
Gucci!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gucci Trey Songz put it on  
My shirt off when I perform  
She say this her favorite song  
She got on my favorite thong  
She so hot  
Too hot to touch  
Truthfully too much for lames  
Gucci mane I'm extra game  
So extra rubbers I'm a bring  
Got your main thang screaming Gucci  
Every Tuesday night we cool whip  
Wish we could do it more often  
But I'm often somewhere flossin'  
Lay it down like carpet barbie  
Aston martin double park it  
Beat it like we got a problem  
Pop her till she call me poppa  
Freakin' partners  
Why we never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Freakin' partners  
Why they never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

Gucci Mane,Bet Money,/g/gucci+mane/bet+money_21085850.html,"Break a line to a bunch of dimes then you grind up  
Money got me sure my ass can't even hold my pants up  
Twenty niggas standing on the flat all getting off  
Found a jacket, get em bro, late with his head soft  
Try me in the six, I'ma raise this forty five up  
Shave a brick, put it back together, that's a lineup  
We mix the chick, use a little cut, that's a temp fade  
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade  
  
I'm a multimillionaire, I got a couple hundred on me  
And no more mac, I told the scrap, I make you stick yourself like Tony  
I give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me  
And I'm so bossy in my altar, smoking kush and sipping coffee  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto, if you speak it then I'm with ya  
Any sideline nigga, they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me, yeah I'm ready, got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy I'm all about a chick  
She don't ask no questions, boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They don't hear me yet  
  
I'ma get that check, that money  
Y'all niggas out here funny  
You know y'all nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby  
I'ma fool with it though, too clumsy  
On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
I'm like eleven of them back, give me that fucking walkie talkie  
Then get lost cause when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
It's since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers, that's my killers, ain't gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money

I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen  
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal  
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal  
I used to trap on the corner, trap ? with the thermal  
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you  
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone  
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home  
In the place that I said, everything that I meant  
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads  
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread  
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice  
  
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day  
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face  
Bigger ? and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with her don't like  
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section Lil Jay like nigga day  
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, anything with my pistol say  
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight  
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today  
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today  
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?  
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face  
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C  
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi  
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway  
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high

Should have brought my phantom na, but I'm mad at my driver  
He so fuckin' turnt up, ridin' on auto pilot smokin' kush and smilin',  
He drinkin' while he drivin'  
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em  
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own  
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone  
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone  
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light  
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight  
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice  
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might

Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop  
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok  
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots  
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot  
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked  
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock  
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know  
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe  
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle  
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder  
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters  
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother

I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds  
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'  
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'  
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion  
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday  
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'  
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions  
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky  
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits  
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged  
My charm big as a midget  
I give yo ass the business

I was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high can't touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin' me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Woke up I'm grown I gotta blame myself  
Streets taught me everything I train to sell  
Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else  
Then my lima crew was like me a member  
Think every man worth, enemies himself  
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell  
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail  
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell  
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years  
I'm going hard see I might as well  
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had  
And my daddy dad my great great great great  
Grandpa had a really crazy swag  
So I stand a day  
Diggin' down a grave  
That if I can change now  
And my mind is made  
A got a point and prove  
And a sign to raise  
Can't let them make mistakes  
That his daddy made

This crazy summer ain't feelin that  
I guess they wanna see us kill each other  
If im dead who the fuck gon' help my mother  
I done struggled to hustle im too hard for this  
I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that  
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches  
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at  
My home boy gone where the flowers at  
Out of money and the work can't bring that back  
If I had one wish, wish momma there  
Could come down now and see me rap  
But she see me now and I believe in that  
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back  
So I put my family on I my back  
Lost so much I cant pay that back  
I was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see

Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
It's alive its alive rounds kill the eyes  
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein  
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise  
I get extra from whipping up extra pies  
I'm in a hood like the mayor 'round election time  
Here's a suggestion don't park your car next to mine  
I'm a star when the light hit I'm supposed to shine  
Your flow is garbage they let me out just in time  
They got a section but none of the hoes are fine  
They need to exit don't let the grind past you by  
I run laps round lames with my shoes untied  
I jump the line walk in and watch the crowd divide  
Still stuck outside its the ugly side  
Look Medusa in the eye and Medusa died  
This top secret shit classified  
Don't blame me swizz was the mastermind  
Cant breath cant breath tone tony brush the time  
I keep my chain moon walking Michael Jackson time  
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind

Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news  
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels  
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused  
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops  
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch I'm the shit  
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit  
Two things in this world I ain't never seen  
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean?  
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath  
Cause I don't chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me  
Excuse my french I'm Gucci I'm so fucking gutter  
It don't make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers

So not to say my life is it  
I said no doc my wife is it  
Now I'm back back going like I never never left  
Plus the boy right here I'm fresh to death (whoo)  
Chris Jones on my feet see I can't fall from Suzuki jeeps  
Now I'm jumping off decks  
The word about the haters they can be upset and  
The black card in my back pocket  
The corner sig' is looking like a speeding rocket  
Yeah I'm zooming on a highway  
And you should love me I did it my way

Got me coming back, now I'm trying to find this ho

Financially stable, very successful  
Money on the marble(floor)

Itineraries, calenders, baby and agendas  
Boo I'll fuck ya, hit ya when I hit ya

Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her

Down south, gold mouth, ya them birds fly south  
Made a half a million dollars in my trap house

If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
Mojo told me step my game up  
So if I throw up man, shrimp might come up  
Cameleon paint same color the vomit

I'm on the look out for a big fine woman  
Who wanna suck dick and can keep me company  
I thug this, love this, never been love sick  
But been frost bit, back back young bitch

Six 12's beat every time the fuckin drum kick

To apply it all to everyday life

You can always use new blood

And the last whale will swim to the shore

Nothing is real  
Spend another lonely life  
With nothing to feel  
  
Was it something  
In the stories everyone told you?  
You needn't heed them  
Maybe you should read them  
Go back to where you came from  
Why did you land?  
You couldn't have stayed in flight forever

""Man get off the street!""

Cronies at his feet  
Turned on his radio and picked up the noise  
Age rules with reason  
and who's to disagree?  
Not Mr. Spit with his abrupt delivery  
And Mr. Intelligent is just a wannabe like me  
And who makes the breakfast?  
And who gasses the truck?  
The same little bee that stung the bull  
And caused the bull to buck  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay  
If you were 10 years younger  
And I was a sunbeam  
""Wished I Was A Giant"" said  
""Man, it's just a dream""  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay...

Where everyone can hide  
  
We're in the wormhole  
Seeking to be safe again  
Without a single brave soul  
Leaking out tonight  
  
After the fires there's a falling rain  
Washing us free of the daily pain  
Off the hook and down the drain  
And out to the other side  
  
To where the soil is rich and muddy in the riverbed  
Feed on the urgent promise  
Of the dead tonight

When I longed you'd take me.

A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,

I saw the look in his eyes  
Somethin' tells me he's been here before

That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son

When I speak a piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
'Cause I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
  
Be it a song or a casual conversation  
To hold my tongue speaks  
Of quiet reservations  
Your words once heard  
They can place you in a faction  
My words may disturb  
But at least there's a reaction  
  
Sometimes I want to kill  
Sometimes I want to die  
Sometimes I want to destroy  
Sometimes I want to cry  
Sometimes I could get even  
Sometimes I could give up  
Sometimes I could give  
Sometimes I never give a fuck  
  
It's only for a while  
I hope you understand  
I never wanted this to happen  
Didn't want to be a man  
So I hid inside my world  
I took what I could find  
I cried when I was lonely  
I fell down when I was blind  
  
But don't damn me when I speak  
A piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden

An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper

How can I ever satisfy you  
An how can I ever make you see  
That, deep inside we're all somebody  
An it don't matter who you want to be  
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend  
For this man can say it happened  
'Cause this child has been condemned  
So I stepped into your world  
I kicked you in the mind  
An I'm the only witness  
To the nature of my crime  
  
But look at what we've done  
To the innocent and young  
Whoa listen to who's talking  
'Cause we're not the only ones  
The trash collected by the eyes  
And dumped into the brain  
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts  
You tell me who's to blame  
  
I know you don't want to hear me crying  
An I know you don't want to hear me deny  
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions  
But your delusions are yours an not mine  
We take for granted that we know the whole story  
We judge a book by it's cover  
And read what we want  
Between selected lines  
  
Don't hail me  
An don't idolize the ink  
Or I've failed in my attentions  
Can you find the missing link  
Your only validation is in living your own life  
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time  
So I send this song to the offended  
I said what I meant and I've never pretended  
As so many others do intending just to please  
If I damned your point of view  
Could you turn the other cheek  
  
Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
Put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
Don't damn me  
I said don't damn me  
I said don't hail me  
Ah, don't damn me

Hopin' that you'd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you won't take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what you'd believe it is -  
Well I guess it never is  
It's these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah, I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
'Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs

Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion -  
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes it's best to walk away  
Me I'm just here hangin' on  
It's my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
I've worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
I'm taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love that's passed away  
I know it's never easy

That I've been brought down in this storm

No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore

No, I..  
No, I...  
  
Forgive them they teared down my soul  
Bless them that they might grow old  
And free them so that they may know  
That it's never too late  
  
For the many times would seem like a memory  
I searched and found the way to choose to the end  
I found the ways, why it had to be  
Mired in denial and saw all the rain  
  
If we ever find it true  
Life we have is made to choose  
Free the ball, the chain  
We're here together  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Stand up for righteousness!  
What?  
Stand up for justice!  
What?  
Stand up for truth!  
How can a person grow up with all this around them?  
You got to call on that something  
Where does it come from?  
That can make a way out of no way  
All this hatred?  
What we've got here is..  
Fear!  
That power that can make a way out of now no way  
Failure to communicate  
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!  
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we  
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know..  
Sometimes...  
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with  
I feel discouraged  
It gets taught  
Sometimes I feel discouraged  
I felt this fear  
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,  
No never alone!  
Let's get something straight, alright?  
Promised never to leave me!  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone!  
All men betray. All lose heart!  
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe  
Black men and white men  
Together at the table of brotherhood!  
I have a dream  
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!  
  
  
I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
And I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm

I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I've been around for a long, long year  
Stole many a man's soul and faith  
  
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ  
Had his moment of doubt and pain  
Made damn sure that Pilate  
Washed his hands and sealed his fate  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
  
I stuck around St. Petersberg  
When I saw it was a time for a change  
Killed the Czar and his ministers  
Anastasia screamed in vain  
  
I rode a tank  
Held a general's rank  
When the Blitzkrieg raged  
And the bodies stank  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
What's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  
  
I watched with glee  
While your kings and queens  
Fought for ten decades  
For the Gods they made  
  
I shouted out  
""Who killed the Kennedys?""  
When after all  
It was you and me  
  
Let me please introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
And I laid traps for troubadours  
Who get killed before they reached Bombay  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

And all the sinners saints  
As heads is tails  
Just call me Lucifer  
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint  
  
So if you meet me  
Have some courtesy  
Have some sympathy, and some taste  
Use all your well-learned politesse  
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah  
But what's puzzling you

On the way beyond that stall.  
To those non-negotiations  
To simulate a call,  
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you  
  
Up and sitting pretty,  
On a pedestal of men  
And now you're sleeping like an angel,  
Near the man who reaped it in.

I'm gonna be a ghost, gonna wear a funny sheet

You'll see me at the door, with all my spooky friends  
Screaming for candy, with wide open hands.

We'll live happily ever after, well at least for tonight.

I'm gonna be a cavegirl, living years ago  
Playing with the dinosaurs, it's fun to watch them go  
You'll see me on the street, with clothing made of fur  
With all my spooky monster friends, who are gonna cause a stir.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna be a witch, put snakes in my hair,  
Everyone will run away, but I don't really care.  
I'll look really freaky, riding on my broom  
My cat will be behind me, screeching at the moon

I'm gonna be a cowboy, a-ridin' on the range

Spooky, spooky, very spooky,  
Don't look at me cause I'm too kooky
