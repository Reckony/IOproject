Christy Moore,Among The Wicklow Hills,/c/christy+moore/among+the+wicklow+hills_21007120.html,"The autumn evenings filled with copper shades  
I see the birds' neck in the frame  
A figure walks into the sunset  
Someone goes past suspended from the sky  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everything's remote control  
For me it's just a case of  
What's on the far side of the road  
  
Tell everybody  
I'm going away for ten years  
I'm going to wander  
Among the Wicklow hills  
  
The travelling children in their Sunday clothes  
Lost on the corner of the Street  
Fat gypsy lady smacks the windowpane  
A farm dog gets out on the motorway  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everything's remote control  
For me it's just a case of  
What's on the far side of the road  
  
Tell everybody  
I'm going away for ten years  
I'm going to wander  
Among the Wicklow hills

Christy Moore,Anne Lovett,/c/christy+moore/anne+lovett_21007141.html,"Everybody knew, nobody said.  
A week ago last Tuesday.  
She was just fifteen years.  
When she reached her full term.  
She went to a grotto.  
Just a field,  
In The Middle of The Island.  
To deliver herself.  
  
Her Baby died,  
She died  
A week ago last Tuesday.  
It was a sad slow stupid death for them both.  
Everybody knew, nobody said.  
At a Grotto  
In a Field  
In The Middle Of The Island

Christy Moore,Avondale,/c/christy+moore/avondale_21007199.html,"Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely  
Vale  
Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud  
Eagle  
Where pride and ancient glory fade  
Such was the land where he was laid  
Like Christ was thirty pieces paid  
For Avondale's proud eagle  
  
Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely  
  
Vale  
Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud  
Eagle  
Long years that green and lovely glade  
Have lost for now our grandest Gael  
And Cursed the land that has betrayed  
Our Avondale's proud eagle

Christy Moore,Back Home In Derry,/c/christy+moore/back+home+in+derry_21007190.html,"In 1803 we sailed out to sea  
Out from the sweet town of Derry  
For Australia bound if we didn't all drown  
And the marks of our fetters we carried  
In our rusty iron chains we cried for our weans  
Our good women we left in sorrow  
As the mainsails unfurled, our curses we hurled  
On the English, and thoughts of tomorrow  
  
At the mouth of the Foyle, bid farewell to the soil  
As down below decks we were lying  
O'Doherty screamed, woken out of a dream  
By a vision of bold Robert dying  
The sun burned cruel as we dished out the gruel  
Dan O'Connor was down with a fever  
Sixty rebels today bound for Botany Bay  
How many will meet their reciever  
  
Chorus  
Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry  
Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry  
  
I cursed them to hell as her bow fought the swell  
Our ship danced like a moth in the firelight  
White horses rode high as the devil passed by  
Taking souls to Hades by twilight  
Five weeks out to sea, we were now forty-three  
We buried our comrades each morning  
In our own slime we were lost in a time  
Of endless night without dawning  
  
Chorus  
  
Van Diemen's land is a hell for a man  
To end out his whole life in slavery  
Where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law  
Neither wind nor rain care for bravery  
Twenty years have gone by, I've ended my bond  
My comrades ghosts walk behind me  
A rebel I came - I'm still the same  
On the cold winters night you will find me

Christy Moore,Bright Blue Rose,/c/christy+moore/bright+blue+rose_21007188.html,"I skimmed across black water, without once submerging  
Onto the banks of an urban morning  
That hungers the first light, much much more  
Than mountains ever do  
  
And she like a ghost beside me goes down with the ease  
of a dolphin  
And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed  
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every  
feature  
And I am the geek with the alchemists stone  
  
For all of you who must discover, for all who seek to  
understand  
For having left the path of others, you find a very  
special hand  
  
And it is a holy thing, and it is a precious time  
And it is the only way  
  
Forget-me-nots among the snow, it's always been and so  
it goes  
To ponder his death and his life eternally

Two thousand years and still it goes

Christy Moore,Burning Times,/c/christy+moore/burning+times_20160789.html,"In the cool of the evening, they used to gather.  
Neath the stars in the meadow circling an old oak tree.  
At the times appointed... By the seasons...  
Of the earth and the phases of the moon.  
In the center stood a woman,  
Equal with the others and respected for her worth.  
One of the many we call the witches,  
The healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth.  
And the people grew through the knowledge she gave them,  
Herbs to heal their bodies, spells to make their spirits whole.  
Can't ya hear them chanting healing incantations,  
Calling forth the wise ones, celebrating in dance and song...  
(... Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna...)  
There were those who came to power through domination.  
And they bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.  
They sought control of the common people  
By demanding allegiance to the church of Rome.  
And the Pope declared an inquisition  
It was war against the women, whose powers they feared.  
In this holocaust against The Nature People  
Nine million European women died.  
And the tale is told of those who by the hundreds,  
Holding together, chose their death in the sea.  
While chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess,  
A refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free.  
(... Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna...)  
Now the earth is a witch and the men still burn her,  
Stripping her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.  
Still to us the earth is a healer, a teacher, a mother.  
A weaver of a web of light that keeps us all alive.  
She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.  
She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive.

Christy Moore,Giuseppe,/c/christy+moore/giuseppe_21007176.html,"Every time I go to London  
I think about Giuseppe Conlon  
Who left his home in Belfast  
And travelled over to his son  
As he said goodbye to Sarah  
And took the boat to Heysham  
Little did Giuseppe know  
He'd never see that place again.  
  
Giuseppe was an ailing man  
And every breath he drew  
Into his tired lungs  
He used to maintain his innocence  
Behind those walls  
Behind those bars  
For everyday remaining in his life  
Maintaining his innocence

She goes off in the air with the dew all on her wings  
  
Oh Roger the ploughboy he is a dashing blade  
He goes whistling and singing over yonder leafy shade  
He met with dark haired Susan, she's handsome I declare  
And she is far more enticing than the birds up in the

One evening when they're coming from the rakes of the

The meadows bein' all mown and the grass had been cut  
Down  
As she should chance to stumble all on the new mown hay  
Oh it's kiss me now or never, then this bonnie lass did  
Say  
  
The lark in the morning...  
  
When twenty long weeks, they were over and were past  
Her mammy asked the reason why she thickened round the  
Waist  
It was the jolly ploughboy, this bonnie lass did say  
He caused me for to tumble all on the new mown hay  
  
The lark in the morning...  
  
Here's a health to you ploughboys wherever you may be  
That like to have a bonnie lass a-sitting on each knee  
With a pint of good strong porter, you'll whistle and

Our world went out of kilter.  
In that split second,  
Veronica was gone.

Your story will be written,

Until her job is done.  
With fists and boots you broke her bones,  
You gunned her down at home,  
But as soon as she was able,  
She faced you once again.

And you who took the message down,  
You who hired the hit men,  
And you who hatched the plan,  
You who drew the money down,  
And you who paid it over,  
You who remain silent,  
You are guilty, every one.

Me lay down alone, was good the rum  
Me fall asleep, the boat she come  
The girl she look till come the dawn  
She weep and cry, ""Return for home""  
The whistle blow, me open me eyes  
Was bright the sun, was blue the sky  
Me grab me shoes, me jump and run  
Me see the boat head for horizon  
Havana moon, is gone the rum  
The boat she sail, me love she gone

Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep 'em warm

His ev'ry dream was built around his daughter Caroline  
He remembered ev'ry time she'd turn another year  
And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear  
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday  
When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away  
He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll  
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold  
It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine  
And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline  
Maarching on his arm she whispered, ""Pa, I still love you""  
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, ""I do""  
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind  
When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline

I have changed, darling, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, was love blinded and I couldn't see  
I sat down a many evening with my mind in a total ruin  
Wondering where on earth you were and what you might be doing  
But I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you was love blinded and I couldn't see  
I have waited for you at morning, right behind a sleepless night  
But now my eyes are wide open and I see you wasn't right  
Yes, I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, I was love blinded and I couldn't see  
If you still love me baby, you gonna have to come across  
We will tear off together so there will be no loving lost

Chuck Berry,Jaguar And Thunderbird,/c/chuck+berry/jaguar+thunderbird_20224097.html,"Chorus: Slow down, little Jaguar  
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford  
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road  
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford  
Jaguar setting on ninety nine  
Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line  
Just a half-a-mile from Newtonville  
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill  
It said : ""35 miles, and stay in line""  
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign  
Chorus  
Ludenville was a real small town  
Had a hundred and two  
And nine acres of ground  
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise  
Told him ""Park down in Newtonville  
And catch 'em guys""  
Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds  
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed  
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road  
Said ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford""  
Chorus  
Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third  
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird  
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine  
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line  
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat  
But if he aimed to get 'em  
He'd have to do more than that  
Crest of the hill, he's about a mile behind  
There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line  
Chorus  
Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade  
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made  
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed  
And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead  
Jaguar said ""You ain't won the race yet""  
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet  
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind  
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line  
Slow down little Jaguar,  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford

And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,  
I took a trip on a sailing ship,  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.  
  
Down at the market you can hear,  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,  
Akie rice, salt fish are nice,  
And the sun is fine any time of the year.

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,

Sounds of laughter everywhere,  
And the children sway to and fro,  
I must declare that my heart is there,  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.

Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,/c/chuck+berry/jo+jo+gunne_20224368.html,"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.  
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree  
Hanging on a branch up under the sun  
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne  
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain  
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain  
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive  
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive  
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail  
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail  
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree  
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me  
An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight  
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight  
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds  
Leo got back to the square of the fight  
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight

Said she was blue and oh so lonesome  
And would I try to understand  
I didn't know till this morning  
How much my woman means to me  
This morning when I got home, she was not there  
I noticed her clothes were gone  
And a little note lay on my shelf  
Said as you read this, I love you still  
But I'll be gone, I don't know where  
Today I got the blues and I got 'em bad  
Last night as I lay sleeping  
My conscious will not go to rest  
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had  
One of these days, can't say where and I don't know when  
It may be in time, it may be soon  
It may be in a place I've never been  
But I'm gonna find that fine woman  
And together with her again

I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down.  
I think I see her please let me off this bus  
  
Nadine, honey is that you?  
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?  
Seems like every time I see you Darling you got something else to do  
  
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back  
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored cadillac  
I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at  
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat  
  
Downtown searching for her, looking all around.  
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town.  
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.  
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab.'  
  
She move around like a wave of summer breeze,  
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze.  
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier.  
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear.

Go Tulane, use all the speed you got.  
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot.  
Go Tulane, he's laggin behind.  
Go 'head on, Tulane.  
  
Go by your father's house and tell him business is slow  
And see if he will loan us something, soon as he hits the dough.  
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room  
Go by Doctor Keller's, tell him you swallowed some perfume  
Tell him we need him quick, 'cuz he may have to testify  
That you been sick all day and that's a perfect alibi  
  
Chorus:  
  
Go,let Daddy drive in case you run into the Man  
Back by the shop and get the stuff and hide it in the van.  
Go back by your father's, get the money for the bail.  
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten, funky jail.  
We gotta get a lawyer in the clique of politics  
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fixed.  
  
Chorus:  
Go 'head on, Tulane.

To have been your chaperone  
And if you choose me for your steady

Cinderella,I'm Giving Love For Christmas,/c/cinderella/im+giving+love+for+christmas_20827083.html,"I'm giving love for Christmas  
To everyone I know  
It doesn't need a bow  
It only needs to come from your heart  
  
I'm giving love for Christmas  
So everyone can see  
What Christmas means to me  
It's more than presents under the tree  
  
Christmas is all about caring  
And as every princess knows  
Nothing is quiet as warming  
When it's storming or it snows  
  
So, I'm giving love for Christmas  
The best gift that I can give  
And in these times we live  
It seems more and more, what we're looking for  
  
Christmas is being with family  
Seeing all the friends you've missed  
Making new Christmas memories  
That's the first thing on my Christmas list  
  
I'd give you everything  
If I had everything, it's true  
But all that I have is my heart to give  
So that's what I'm giving you  
  
I'm giving love for Christmas  
And hoping that you will too  
(I will, I will)  
  
And hoping that if you do  
It just might be me, you give your love to  
And that would be  
My best Christmas dream come true

The anchor and foundation of multi-corporations

Propped inside was an old man

The dance hall called for an' ambulance  
The bars all closed up fast

All the changes that were to come?  
All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield

R is for the reindeer prancing by the window pane,  
I is for the icing on the cake as sweet as sugar cane,  
S is for the stocking hanging on the chimney wall,  
T is for the toys beneath the tree so tall,

Cliff Richard,Christmas Never Comes,/c/cliff+richard/christmas+never+comes_20032095.html,"Talk about the heart of christmas,  
Talk about the reason and the rhyme.  
Talk about the sentimental feelings,  
Talk about the candlelight and wine,  
Talk about the children.  
Listen to the voices singing.  
Listen to the laughter as they play  
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat  
Whose loneliness is never far away.  
(chorus)  
In some hearts it's never christmas,  
But it's winter all the time.  
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,  
Children of tomorrow,  
How they need a star to follow.  
In some hearts it's always winter,  
For some hearts it seems,  
That christmas never comes.  
Don't forget the winter's children,  
Shadows on a star that never shines.  
Looking for the love that never happened  
Looking for the chris in christmas time.  
The lonely voice,  
That can't rejoice,  
That has no choice.  
(chorus)  
In some hearts it's never christmas,  
But it's winter all the time.

With no one left to beat  
There's still a fading desire  
To burn a naked light  
Just to defy the night  
  
Come on and call me a liar  
A crumble tumble down  
In fumble bumble town  
Our lives a ruin  
We reconstruct a bit  
And pretty up a bit  
We hardly know what we're doing

Make the best of this world  
She's like a diamond  
Innocent girl  
We watch the sign of the times  
Writing on the wall, cities may fall  
  
Back through the city fog  
I was another cog  
For the machinery there  
Now the machines have gone  
The silence hanging on  
I sit, I stare

Come on and take your aim  
I feel the mildest pain  
Protecting something so rare  
'Cause there's a gem or two  
Inside the human zoo  
If only you are aware

To beat the others in the race

Then I looked in those big green eyes  
And I wondered what I came there for.

I can hear the Sally Army in the old town square  
I can hear their brass and chorus's, they fill the air  
And I wonder why they do it when there's no-one ever there  
Moments later, out of bed goes me and I'm gazing out the window in the morning
light  
And the lasses in their bonnets makes a pretty sight  
And I thought if that's an army, it's a funny way to fight  
But its an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
And if I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Babababbababababa  
Oh it's an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
If I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Some years later, looking back at me  
I believe I've found the answer and I'd like to say  
You've need never be alone when God's a prayer away  
And He'll fill you with his sunshine if your life is cold and grey

And every man on earth conceals a secret  
On which he feeds and yet tears him apart  
And in this child so great that complication  
Will surely destroy the strongest heart  
And as you fall into the traps, he sets you  
And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line  
And as I watch you peer into his darkness  
I pray you'll never search, I pray you'll never search for mine

It's like I've been sleeping for years  
I'm not awake as I can be  
But my seeing's better  
I can see through the tears  
I've been realizing that  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But there's scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
Who all know what I know  
And it's good that it's so  
It's in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by

Drinking her memory away when he can  
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore  
  
But now they don't cry anymore  
How does it all come to happen  
That's not what loving is for  
And if i thought it was,i would leave here in the morning  
I'd sooner sleep on the floor

Once in a while I get this feelin'  
Seems all day and night time too  
I don't belong I'm just passin' through  
I guess you're right I think too much  
Still in all, I miss your touch  
A crazy notion a careless thought  
I start to worry and time gets short  
Well think of this my dear young one  
The time to act has just begun  
  
What'll I do if you walk away  
What'll I do if you walk away  
Well I haven't a chance  
No I haven't a chance

Baby it's a violent world  
  
Oh love don't let me go  
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow  
I could hear it coming  
I could hear the sirens sound  
Now my feet won't touch the ground  
  
Time came a creepin'  
Oh and time's a loaded gun  
Every road is a ray of light  
It goes on  
Time only can lead you on  
Still it's such a beautiful night  
  
Oh love don't let me go  
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow

We can watch it and stay and we can listen  
  
Oh, rainy day, come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
And we're separated now  
I'm down  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house  
  
Then there was rain  
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain  
My lonely little heart would've broke again  
Times were vicious  
  
Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win  
You win but with less than when you begin  
Deeper that the knife goes in  
Oooooooooooooooh  
  
Ooh, rainy day come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
We're separated now  
I'm down  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house

From the windows they were watching  
While we froze down below  
  
When the future's architectured  
By a carnival of idiots on show  
You'd better lie low

If you love me  
Won't you let me know?  
  
Was a long and dark December  
When the banks became cathedrals  
And the fox  
Became God  
  
Priests clutched onto bibles  
Hollowed out to fit their rifles  
And the cross was held aloft  
  
Bury me in armour  
When I'm dead and hit the ground  
My nerves are poles that unfold

I don't want to be a soldier  
With the captain of some sinking ship  
Would stow, far below  
  
So if you love me  
Why'd you let me go?  
  
I took my love down to violet hill  
There we sat in snow  
All the time she was silent and still

Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never, never an honest word  
That was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking.  
But now, God knows,  
Anything goes.  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four-letter words  
Writing prose.  
Anything goes.  
If driving fast cars you like,  
If low bars you like,  
If old hymns you like,  
If bare limbs you like,  
If Mae West you like,  
Or me undressed you like,  
Why, nobody will oppose.  
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-  
Truding in nudist parties in  
Studios.  
Anything goes.  
  
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)  
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her,  
Then I suppose  
Anything goes.  
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-  
Ough money to let Max Gordon  
Produce his shows,  
Anything goes.  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today,  
And black's white today,  
And day's night today,  
And that gent today  
You gave a cent today  
Once had several chateaux.  
When folks who still can ride in jitneys  
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys  
Lack baby clo'es,  
Anything goes.  
  
If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction  
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,  
Then Anna shows  
Anything goes.  
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up  
Now turns a handspring landing up-  
On her toes,  
Anything goes.  
Just think of those shocks you've got  
And those knocks you've got  
And those blues you've got  
From that news you've got  
And those pains you've got  
(If any brains you've got)  
From those little radios.  
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,  
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons  
'Cause Franklin knows  
Anything goes.

by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,  
Here I sit, above the town,  
In my pet-paillated gown,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor

I concentrate on you.  
  
On your smile so sweet, so tender,  
When at first your kiss I decline.  
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,  
And once again our arms intertwine  
  
And so, when wise men say to me  
That love's young dream never comes true,  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

I hate men  
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen  
  
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism  
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism  
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism  
Oh, I hate men  
  
From all I've read alone in bed, from A to Z, about them  
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout them  
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without them?  
Still, I hate men

How wrong I was to let you go

The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high  
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I  
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound  
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down  
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold  
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold  
  
The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips  
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips  
He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around  
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""  
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost  
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost  
  
Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died  
He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive  
And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won  
I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun  
Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test  
And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west

Conway Twitty,Bad Seed My Daddy Sowed,/c/conway+twitty/bad+seed+my+daddy+sowed_20512035.html,"I was found in Wilson County just a mile outside of town  
On the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where I am  
I was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows  
And as far as they concern I'm just a bad seed daddy sowed  
They brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know  
And since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow  
But they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads  
And they asked the Lord to light my path and guide each step I made  
But the path you're walking on becomes a mighty rocky road  
When you know that all you'll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed  
At thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age  
And with love so strong I could see no wrong in decision that I made  
And you know I learned that there was truth in all I always been told  
Because you can't judge a book by its cover  
And everything that's shinin' sure isn't gold  
Yes I guess I'm guilty of dreaming an impossible dream  
Because the way the things turned out sure isn't way it seemed  
And so tonight I'm leavin' behind the only thing I ever had to call my own  
And I know as long as you live you're always be a reminder of all my wrongs  
But I hope that he'll forgive me when he's old enough to know  
That just like me he'll always be the bad seed his daddy sowed

He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes  
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs  
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer  
  
I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit  
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked  
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass  
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass  
  
Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine  
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've
seen  
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm  
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm  
  
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that  
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black  
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale  
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil  
  
Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps  
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like
that  
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck  
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks

Lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine  
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine  
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright  
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.  
  
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night

Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler  
We were poor, but we had love  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mine  
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn  
Mommie rocked the babies at night  
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light  
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay  
Mommie scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day  
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed  
To complain there was no need  
She'd smile in Mommie's understanding way.  
  
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear  
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from sellin' a hog  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.  
  
Yeah!, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter  
I remember well - the well where I drew water  
The work we done was hard  
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.  
  
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then  
And it's so good to be back home again  
Not much left but the floor  
Nothing lives here anymore  
Except the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter.

With thunder crashing around my head  
My pillow still wet  
From last nights tears  
And as I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Keeps crying out  
And ringing in my ears.  
  
Don't cry daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Johnny  
Together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry.  
  
Why must children be the first  
To feel the pain and hurt the worst  
It's true somehow it don't seem right  
And ev'ry time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so  
I wonder will it be the same tonight?  
  
Don't cry daddy

Joni was the girl who lived next door  
I've known her I guess 10 years or more  
Joni wrote me a note one day  
And this is what she had to say  
  
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you

Then I went over to the house next door  
Her teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I told Joni what I had to say  
  
Joni, Joni, please don't cry  
You'll forget me by and by  
You're just fifteen I'm twenty two  
Joni I just can't wait for you  
  
Soon I left our little home town  
Got me a job and tried to settle down  
But her words kept haunting my memory  
The words that Joni said to me  
  
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane  
I had to see Joni, I had to explain  
How my heart was filled with her memory  
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me  
  
I ran all the way to the house next door  
But things weren't like they were before  
My teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I heard what Joni had to say  
  
Jimmy Jimmy please don't cry  
You'll forget me by and by  
It's been five years since you've been gone

I guess there's a lotta things you don't understand.  
  
But let me say this God she's like a mother to me  
And all I am or ever hoped to be I owe to you and to her  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again...

Wanna start me a new life somewhere.

Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly  
Last night now they blew up his house too  
Down on the boardwalk  
They're gettin' ready for a fight  
Gonna see what them racket boys can do  
Now there's trouble busin'  
In from outta state and the D. A.  
Can't get no relief  
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade  
And the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by  
The skin of it's teeth  
[Chorus:]  
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty  
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away  
But I got debts that no honest man can pay  
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust  
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus  
[Chorus:]  
Now our luck may have died  
And our love may be cold  
But with you forever I'll stay  
We're goin' out  
Where the sand's turnin' to gold  
So put on your stockin's baby 'cause  
The night's getting cold  
And everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Now I been lookin' for a job  
But it's hard to find  
Down here it's just winners and losers  
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that  
Line  
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end  
So honey last night I met this guy and  
I'm gonna do a little favor for him  
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty  
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

And one in Cherokee  
The first one says she's got my child,  
But it don't look like me.  
Set out runnin' but I take my time,  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,  
If I get home before daylight,  
I just might get some sleep tonight.  
  
You can borrow from the devil  
You can borrow from a friend  
The devil'll loan ya twenty  
But your friend got only ten

Chasing dreams we left Topeka following the sun  
We were kids still growing up with rainbows in our mind  
So off we went into the world not knowing what we'd find  
The first few days were filled with fun and laughing her and I  
We'd stop from place to place to try the good times on for size  
She always wore a yellow rose to show her love for me  
A yellow rose so everyone could see  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
She's as pretty as could be  
She always wears a yellow rose so everyone can see  
She always wears a yellow rose for me  
Now the days have past so quickly and the living got so rough  
Suddenly we found we couldn't live just on our love  
Just two kids alone with thought of Kansas in our mind  
Thinking of the families loving arms we left behind  
Of each new day I found that we grew more and more apart  
Though she tried to cling to me with love still in her heart  
Then one day I hurt her like a fool I made her cry  
I noticed that the yellow rose had died  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
Help me find her won't you please  
She always wore a yellow rose so everyone could see

He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row  
The weight of their judgemental glances tells him that his chances

Tomorrow's a name that changed from yesterday to blame  
When a train just don't stop here anymore

And these days my life just careens through a pinball machine  
I could do so much better but I can't get off the tilt  
There's a photograph on a tv, black and white  
Andy says something to you  
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like  
She says I forget myself sometimes, too  
  
But out past the doorways where we are sleeping  
Well, the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
Now I'm not breaking, the train's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a wide mouth spinning the girls around  
Till they can't take it any more

Studs straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves  
And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde  
Gin-tied and Asian, but well preserved  
Remember Annie outside your bedroom window  
Saying, ""Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades""  
Keep going till we hit Reno, Nevada  
I don't see it all that much these days  
  
Still there are pages in back of the action stacks  
Where the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping

Shimmy down the fire escape and say goodbye  
Come outside, "" Andy says, ""I'm dressed up just like Edie  
Changing all the time, my leopard spots to polka dots, just say goodbye  
Come outside, where maybe we can move to California  
Just meet me at the subway and say goodbye  
Come outside, the cops all think we're crazy  
If you steal, you'll just get married  
To a girl who'll never know you and then say goodbye""

Lovely sometimes changes us  
  
Sometimes we're not  
Have you been aching with trust or just  
Have you been waking yourself with lust?  
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?

Cars frozen in flight  
All the traffic stops to stare  
At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada  
Where nothing but air and a pair of gray paper wings

You won't be happy 'round here  
Got on the wagon the tenth of December  
I fell off the first of the year

I know you wish I was dry  
God knows I wish I was somebody else  
Right now I wish I could die

And I want to be a raider, I want anything  
And I want to be a man  
What's the matter?  
Didn't you think we were trying?  
Hey, what's the matter?  
Didn't you think I was somebody else who  
Could lie in the wake of you smile?  
Spent twenty-six stiffening years down the drain  
Women who will spit in your eye  
And a drunkard like me gets the worst of your love  
Good riddance, good luck and good bye  
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears  
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want  
Maybe among the hill folds of my heart and my soul  
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want  
Singing 'till the sky turns and lungs burst and throat burns  
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want  
Screaming 'till the sun houses my here and my now  
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want everything

And the things that you cannot believe, and well

'Cause she don't want anybody to see  
What she looks like when she's down

Then she wonders why they beg her please to never call

Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans

Not quite as brave as we seem

From underneath the bed  
From a long, long time ago

The one that you wore

But I keep tripping on the past  
Finding out reality, well clarity  
Comes in dribs and drabs  
No we never had the time  
For everything we had  
So it felt like we had nothing  
That's what makes this hat so sad  
It was a long, long time ago

Just like a crown up on my head

Everyone looks great to me  
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be

'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby how I think you're pretty smart  
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart  
  
I'll kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go

Some with powder up their nose...  
And the money men who had to steal away.  
Telling stories who they've had.  
Who's a no count, who looks bad.  
Then they turn around and say how much they like you...  
Like you...like you? No.  
  
I love to hate you...I love to hate you...I really do.  
  
Playing games with people lives  
Change the rules when stakes are high.  
All the vampires come out at night to play...  
Things are different today, that is always what you say.  
Well maybe so, except for people like you...  
Like you...like you? No.  
  
I love to hate you...  
  
Look around you can't look down.  
You might miss out on what you think is cool...you fool.  
  
You've decided who I am, in this brief experience  
And if it's worth spending your precious time on me.  
My friend Mel he could relate,  
Told me once I love to hate  
I get so hot the words get stuck  
Stuck like you...  
Like you...like you? No.  
  
I love to hate you...  
It's not just the clothes that you wear  
Or the way you do your hair  
It's just you.

Cyndi Lauper,Minnie And Santa,/c/cyndi+lauper/minnie+santa_20035142.html,"Worked with a woman named Minnie  
One Christmas eve long ago  
When I asked ""What you doing this evening ?""  
Minnie took on a seasonal glow  
She said she'd be waiting for Santa  
She'd be wearing a bright red bow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Now Minnie could not be persuaded  
That Santa just did not exist  
She swore if she put up some mistletoe  
Santa did come give her a kiss  
And there where she'd hung up her stockings  
All in their silky, soft, sheen  
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug  
Where the cookies and milk could be seen  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Now Minnie was older and wiser  
Like a dear old Auntie to me  
But the night that she ran off with Santa  
Was a real epiphany  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Next Xmas I passed by the bakery  
Staring out from on top of a cake  
Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin  
And a gal in silk stockings and lace  
Oh, Minnie and Santa...

There's a cry in the oceans, it's plaintive and blue  
And it rises from the depths, breaks my heart in two  
It's the dreams of the great whales running aground  
For they know that they're eternity bound

Once they've passed into the timeless, they can never more be found

Will we ever seek forgiveness, will we ever earn the crown

Every man was free  
To live the way he chose to live  
And be who he could be  
  
Some of them were farmers there  
And tilled the frozen soil  
But all they got was poverty  
For all their earnest toil  
They say one was a sailor  
Who sailed the wide world round  
Made home port--got drunk one night  
Walked off the pier and drowned  
  
My mother was of Scottish blood  
It's there that she was born  
They brought her to America in 1924  
They left behind the highlands  
And the heather covered hills  
And came to find America  
With broad, expectant dreams  
And iron wills  
  
My grandad worked the steel mills  
Of central Illinois  
His daughter was his jewel  
His son was just his boy  
For thirty years he worked the mills  
And stoked the coke-fed fires  
And looked toward the day  
When he'd at last turn 65  
And could retire  
  
And the sons become the fathers  
And the daughters will be wives  
As the torch is passed from hand to hand  
And we struggle through our lives  
Though the generations wander  
The lineage survives  
And all of us  
From dust to dust  
We all become forefathers

The woman and the man were wed  
Just after the war  
And they settled in this river town  
And three fine sons she bore  
One became a lawyer  
And one fine pictures drew  
And one became this lonely soul  
Who sits here now  
And sings this song to you  
  
And the sons become the fathers  
And the daughters will be wives  
As the torch is passed from hand to hand

Peace of mind --  
As your life spills into mine  
Changing with the seasons  
Filling up the world with time  
Change time to reasons

That I never sang to someone before.  
We have seen a million stars  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breath  
In the sun.  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more.

He works his hands in wood  
And he lives the way his granddad  
Might have liked and understood  
  
He goes to work each morning  
And he comes home every night  
And the time that passes in between  
He knows has been spent right  
  
A child in South Ohio  
A man in Northern Maine  
He took his dream to the end of the world  
And he brought it back again  
  
Here he met his sweet Rebekah  
Here he came to make his stand  
In a house he built in the piny woods  
Where the ocean meets the land  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, his hair is rough and curly  
And his legs they reach the ground  
And his eyes are full of living  
And his back is broad and brown  
  
And his heart is sure and stubborn  
And his pride's too strong to bend  
And somewhere in his life  
He found the time to be my friend  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, he loves his sweet Rebekah  
He'll love her 'til his death  
And she gave to him a bonny son  
And they named the child Seth  
  
And now they are a family  
A community of three  
Living in the piny woods  
Where the soil meets the sea  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home

And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd  
Left that stone in the river bed.  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman, child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land.

Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.  
  
Well, they came from New York City,  
And they came from Alabam'  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land.  
  
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains.  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins.  
  
Oh...

Well, some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest.  
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty  
They had opened up the west.  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed,  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,  
He'd not one penny to his name.

I watched you grow to be a woman  
Living on promises that nobody gave to no one  
They were given to no one  
I started listening to the wind and the rain  
You strained your ears but could hear nothing  
One night I thought I heard them whisper my name  
And I went running  
I left a trail of footprints deep in the snow  
I swore one day I would retrace them  
But when I turned around I found that the wind had erased them  
Now I'll never replace them

Fly away, my sweet bird, over the land  
Take life for all the freedom you can

Well, the offer still stands  
I hear you've taken on a husband and child  
And live somewhere in Pennsylvania  
I never thought you'd ever sever the string but I can't blame you none  
So let the ashes fall and lay where they will

One last time sing that old song we used to know  
But this time sing

Jealousies and legal fees  
Running away like two refugees  
Shadowed eyes and alibis  
Tell you too late you've been victimized.  
  
Freedom is near but seems to elude you  
Trying to change you dreams into  
What your needs allow  
It should be easy by now

Trying your damnedest to laugh  
You've thrown those childish dreams away

A man fired a gun  
I was so steeped in tradition  
That I could not run  
I was raised by a river  
Weaned upon the sky  
And in the mirror of the waters  
I saw myself learn to cry  
As my tears hit the surface  
I saw what had been done  
I gave feet to my freedom  
And I did run  
Someday later  
I saw the writing in the dust  
It told me how I should travel  
It told me who I was  
I ran far from the river  
Far as I could see  
And as the sun hit my shoulders  
I felt it burning me  
How I longed for the waters  
As the fire raged  
How I longed for the river  
As I aged  
I will die by a river  
As it rolls away  
Bury me in the nighttime  
Do not waste the day  
High above the waters  
That roll on to the sea  
All the angels in heaven  
Will laugh at me

All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours  
On our way here  
Tomorrow go back to being friends  
  
Go back to being friends  
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will  
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love  
A thing or two I have to say here  
Tonight let's go all the way then  
Love I'll see you,  
Just for this evening  
Let's strip down, trip out at this  
One evening starts with a kiss  
Run away  
  
And tomorrow  
Back to being friends  
Lovers, love, lovers  
Just for tonight, one night, love you  
And tomorrow say goodbye

Dave Matthews Band,Seek Up,/d/dave+matthews+band/seek+up_20036570.html,"Sometimes I feel like I'm falling  
Fall back again, fall back again,  
Fall back again, fall back again  
  
Oh, life it seems a struggle between  
What we think what we see  
I'm not going to change my ways  
Just to please you or appease you  
Inside a crowd, five billion proud  
Willing to punch it out  
Right, wrong, weak, strong  
Ashes to ashes all fall down  
Look around about this round  
About this merry-go-round around  
If at all God's gaze upon us fall  
His mischievous grin, look at him  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Our emotions can be swept away  
Forget about being guilty,  
We are innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
Sit awhile with TV's hungry child  
Big belly swelled  
Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke  
Keep alive those hungry eyes  
Take a look at me, what you see in me,  
Mirror look at me  
Face it all, face it all again  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that your emotions can be  
Swept away, kept at bay  
Forget about being guilty, I am innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion,  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not  
Going--ha, ha  
  
Say, say  
Look at me in my fancy car  
And my bank account  
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down  
Into my grave, I'd save  
Take a look again, take a look again,  
Take a look again  
Everyday things change,...stay the same  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Your emotions can be swept away  
Intentions are not wicked,  
Don't be tricked into thinking so  
Soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion,  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you,  
The devil's not going--ha, ha  
Fall back again, fall back again, fall back again...

Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling  
She won't look so good in the bright morning light  
[ harmonica ]  
I've known some devils and I've known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night  
But I'll tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light

And I'd sing the red river valley  
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of living'  
Wondering, lord, has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends, me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
He's A drifter and A driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to  
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him  
To A place called the green frog cafe  
And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes  
Lying' about their lives while they played  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
And I looked up and he was pushing eighty  
And there was brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me he's one of the heroes of this country  
See why's he all dressed up like some old man  
Drinking' beer and playing' moon in forty-Two  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
The day before he dies I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamt us up A kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
""DON'T CRY, JACK, IT'S ONLY JESUS COMING""  
Like desperados waiting for the train

There'd be kinfolks callin' until dawn

And grandpa he'd play that fiddle all night long  
Now the women folk they would work out in the kitchen  
You could smell that food for miles and miles around  
Paw he was prayin' my brother Jack would bring him down some moonshine  
Just so's that he could warsh those viddle down  
As soon as all the kids got tired of playin' horseshoes  
Mama she'd call me over to her side  
You know she'd say I'd like to take some pictures  
You could see her face light up with pride  
And then she'd bring out that worn out family album  
Its faded pictures some with corners torn  
She'd laugh and poin and tell me funny stories  
And look she'd say why that's the day that you were born  
And I'd sit and reminisce each picture with her  
And I'd listen to her laughter and her sighs  
But underneath I knew how much I'd hurt her  
For I'd put teardrops in my mama's eyes  
  
In my mama's eyes I've never done a wrong thing  
I was still a baby in my mama's eyes  
That old family album she'll keep on her night stand  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies  
  
Through all those years in prison she stuck by me  
And she came to visit anytime she could  
Well I remember at my trial when she testified she loved me  
And she told the judge I'd always been so good  
Then later through the fame she watched me blossom  
From just a local country singer to a great big star  
She listened to all my records for the hidden meanings  
And she came to hear me sing in all those dim lit bars  
And she read all the things they wrote about me  
But she knew deep in her heart that it was lies  
No she don't hide her head in shame when someone says my name  
You'll find no teardrops in my mama's eyes  
In my mama's eyes...  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies

Most of them I got fightin' in them redneck bars  
And A bunch of brand new tattoos that Squench put on me  
He covered up the ones I'd gotten years ago  
Back in prison when I was just Dave Coe  
And I wasn't famous then and I wasn't free  
You know I grew up in a three room run down shack  
At the foot of the hill by the railroad track  
Where decent folks don't go when the sun goes down  
My daddy worked at the Goodyear tire and rubber company  
And he worked on cars  
My momma went to church and my daddy went to bars  
Most people just called it the hillbilly part of town  
I had a '55 Chevy when I was fifteen  
I painted it red cause I was still green  
Hell I couldn't even afford to buy it gas  
Had A. 410 rifle and a bowie knife to  
Red Man tobacco that I liked to chew  
And we'd count the cars when the trains went past  
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass

If that ain't country it'll hair lip the pope  
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke  
I've been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash  
And if he ain't country i'll kiss your ass

Then one day she saw the light  
Now she don't do those things that she used to do  
She never made the funeral when my daddy died  
I said I'd forgive her but I guess I lied  
Cause there ain't no way to hide the way that I feel  
Me and my brothers took our sister Diane  
Down to the funeral home to see the old man  
Jimmy was the oldest and Diane she was the youngest one  
Jack and Ray was in the middle and then there was me  
And I'm the one that turned 23  
And grew up to be that yankee's rebel son  
Times are changing I heard Bob Dylan say  
It's been fifteen now since my father passed away  
But I can still picture him in his overalls  
Standin' around the house where he made his deals  
Around the porch there was a bunch of old wheels  
And some used Harley Davidson parts that he sold for cash  
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof  
Me and my family was livin' proof  
Everybody called us old poor white trash

Parked beside the local bar  
Once he'd drove it crazy  
Now he's driven it too far  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
  
Someone wrote in soap  
It's over right across the hood  
On the door it said good riddance  
Boy, I feel good  
On the fender were the words  
I won't be home tonight  
And the jukebox in the bar played  
If you're gonna do me wrong do it right  
Laughed so hard I thought now  
There's a guy who's got some spunk  
What a sense of humor  
It said goodbye on the trunk  
Tin cans tied with paper streamers  
Pointing to the bar  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
Just divorced was written...

Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes  
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays  
Just to prove my love for you  
I remember well the first time that I kissed you  
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire
fence  
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us  
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
And if that ain't enough  
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you  
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane  
Climb Mount Everest on a string  
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel  
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee  
There's nothin' I wouldn't do  
If you just say the word I'll catch  
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you  
I remember well the first time

Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane

With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine  
  
Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door  
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor  
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine  
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""  
  
Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison  
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy  
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy  
  
Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy  
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came  
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train  
  
Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""

That connected on marathon shore  
Yes and it was the gateway key west his grandpa  
Had told him ten times or more  
The stories of some sailors curse on the bridge  
Where it opens to let the boats through  
But the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories  
And swear that it just isn't true  
Now most of them sail across to Miami  
From the edge of the blue water line  
With craw fish and snappers to sell at the market  
For money to spend on some wine  
They always cross through at the seven mile bridge  
Except when the moon comes out full  
They're not superstitious they tell you as they are  
Repeating that old seaman's rule  
Watch out for those outlaws and pirates  
Lord knows that they'll steal you blind  
Don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves  
They're robbers and killers of time  
And there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse  
On the seven mile bridge where you find  
They're stealing the future and making believe  
The past is still somewhere behind  
The seven mile bridge, the seven mile bridge  
And he found a woman who'd come here from Cuba  
She gave him a son and a dream  
They lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island  
With the seven mile bridge in between  
She'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering  
If he'd safely pull through the storm  
While he spent his money on painted up women  
And whiskey to keep his blood warm  
Then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke  
While she sat up waiting all night  
Then felling too guilty to face her and tell her  
He'd look for some bully to fight  
At the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines  
Just south of the seven mile bridge  
She waits at the window for signs of his sailboat  
And tries not to worried the kids  
She sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides  
From a husband that's to tired to think  
With feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle  
And pours the remains in the sink  
Now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly  
They know she's a woman alone  
With fingers that tremble she touches her body  
And wishes her man would come home  
Now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief  
His skin looks like leather by now  
His woman's got fat and lost all he  
But, Lord, she's lived up to her vow  
She looks at her son that's going on twenty  
He's ready to live his own life  
She hopes he can find a sea worthy woman  
A sailor sure needs a good wife  
Why he's just like his daddy  
She thinks as she watches  
Him weaving those fish nets all day  
Knowing that some time the seven mile bridge  
Will take him and lead him astray  
He might return his woman would learn  
Broke like his daddy and drunk  
She wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth  
Nailed it over his bunk  
Why then, she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk  
His new wife would want it that way  
Just before the old man shook the younger lads hand

David Allan Coe,The Ride,/d/david+allan+coe/the+ride_20303628.html,"I was thumbing from Montgomery  
I had my guitar on my back  
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac  
He was dress like 1950  
Half drunk and hollow eyed  
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son  
  
Well I sat down in the front seat  
He turned on the radio  
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale  
When I asked him for a light  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride  
  
[Chorus]  
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing  
Have you paid your dues?  
Can you moan the blues?  
Can you bend them guitar strings?  
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?  
'Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride  
  
Well he cried just south of Nashville  
And he turned that car around  
He said this is where you get off boy  
I'm goin' back to Alabam  
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac  
I said mister many thanks  
He said you don't have to call me mister mister  
The whole world calls me Hank

And then go home with that bottle in his hand

I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told George that changing diapers could sure become a drag  
And to clean the house and cook for him was not her kind of bag  
She said he needed someone who would love and understand  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand

I've kicked a few habits and I've marched to the band  
I tried hard to follow the lady of the land

I stumbled through yards on my way to the street  
Running from beds where I did more than sleep  
When I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
  
Well he tackled the bottle and he fumbled the ball  
And he'd touchdown in alleys along where he'd fall  
Just wait for his son to make up for it all

When I was a baby he broke up the team  
Divorcing my mama to live with a dream  
He had back in college when he was still green  
And I was a young Dallas Cowboy

Out of town where the people I knew  
I had the feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known  
A foggy day in a london town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The british museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles had'nt passed  
For suddenly I saw you there  
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere

Something in the day

All clear wail the sirens  
Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Die"" said the General  
""Cobblers"" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said ""Sir,  
There's a crack in the world""  
And the figures went ""squash"",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky

Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs  
Killing time in the '70s  
Smelling of love through the moist winds

And he jokes about his broken English,  
Tries to be a friend to me

Of reading conversation,  
I stand without a word to say

Full of folk who don't know me  
And they walk in twos or threes or more  
While the light  
That shines above the grocer's store  
Investigates my face so rudely  
And my essays lying  
Scattered on the floor  
Fulfill their needs just by being there  
And my hands shake, my head hurts,  
My voice sticks inside my throat

Dawn chorus for

Those who said a new world, new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

""We had a friend, a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men, but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
'Wish You Could Hear'  
'Love Is All We Need'  
'Kick Out The Jams'  
'Kick Out Your Mother'  
'Cut Up Your Friend'  
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe""  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain  
It said:  
""I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls 'Now'  
And I want to believe  
That a light's shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh, we want to live

Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh  
""Good God, oh my"", I cry  
And die, and lie beside  
She is the apple in my eye  
She talked to God  
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped  
A dope she roped this salty lie  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it  
And deep my wound  
Within for every second chance it was thy tore  
From deep within despite the rain  
My words are worn  
She loves to talk into the phone  
No matter who, no matter when  
No matter where  
No better than the faulty line  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it

Shaking their sex and their bones

I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I feed the lions in trafalgar square and I dig everything - dig everything  
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug  
Everything -dig everything  
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything - dig
everything  
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I've got more friends than I had out for dinners  
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners  
Rick, john, sally, a connection named paul  
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall  
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything  
Dig  
I've made myself at home -dig everything  
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone  
All the movie shows - dig everything  
I sunbathe for love - dig everything  
Even when it's not too hot - dig everything  
'cause I dig everything -dig everything  
Oh yeah

Towards the lights the beacons above the hill  
The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East

A fear of rear windows and swinging doors  
A love of violence and dread of sighs

Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground

And walk to the crossroads  
So take this knife  
And meet me across the river

The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes  
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief  
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft

Then dance just like a Casanova  
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet  
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat  
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat  
The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty""  
The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity""  
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
  
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash  
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash  
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool  
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose  
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground  
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street  
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat  
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat  
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street  
  
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead  
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead  
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread  
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat  
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your
seat  
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet  
Then you're outta that hole and back up on the street

Let's dance  
For fear tonight is all  
Let's sway  
You can look into my eyes  
Let's sway  
Underthe moonlight, the Sirius moonlight  
  
If you say run, I'll run with you  
If you say hide, we'll hide  
Watch my love for you  
It would break my heart in two  
If you should fall into my arms  
And tremble like a flower

David Bowie,Letter To Hermione,/d/david+bowie/letter+to+hermione_20247187.html,"The hand that wrote this letter  
Sweeps the pillow clean.  
So rest your head and read a treasured dream.  
I care for no one else but you.  
I tear my soul to cease the pain.  
I think maybe you feel the same,  
What can we do?  
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do.  
So I've been writing just for you.  
  
They say your life is going very well.  
They say you sparkle like a different girl.  
But something tells me that you hide  
When all the world is warm and tired.  
You cry a little in the dark,  
Well so do I.  
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say,  
But I can see it's not okay.  
  
He makes you laugh.  
He brings you out in style.  
He treats you well  
And makes you up real fine.  
And when he's strong,  
He's strong for you.  
And when you kiss  
It's something new.  
But did you ever call my name  
Just by mistake?  
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.  
So I'll just write some love to you.

And her daddy has told her to go

Now she walks through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen

For she's lived it ten times or more  
She could spit in the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on

It's the freakiest show  
Take a look at the Lawman  
Beating up the wrong guy

That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow  
Now the workers have struck for fame  
'Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds  
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

He brought them presents with every coins he made  
Then two gentlemen called him  
Asked him for his name  
Why was he friends with the children  
Were they just a game?  
Leave them alone or we'll get sore  
We've had blokes like you in the station before

Packed his bags, his heart in pain  
Wiped a tear, caught a train

Oh, oh, oh  
  
I was empty, it was all gone  
The birds would sing but made no sound  
Till I met you, found I was all wrong  
You picked me up right off the ground  
  
Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again  
Crashing down from the sky, you know  
Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend  
That's the one thing, we all wanna know  
  
So if we ever, fell in love  
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh  
So if we ever fell in love  
Oh, oh, oh

Through art of artists and their models  
You can comb through the Rome coliseum

There's the Mona Lisa, the Tower of Pisa  
A cowhand's daughter out in Texas  
And there's modern art to see  
That makes you wonder  
What the heck is meant to be  
On the streets of Murmark there's a fancy kind of art that is strictly for the  
Tourists from the sticks  
And those wise Greenwich guys really open up your eyes painting portraits of  
Their pretty little chicks  
So to each creator and imitator who daubs and dabbles with the brushes  
To the guys that draw their bunnies or the Sunday morning funnies  
And brighten up the world today  
And to every girl that poses to every Grandma Moses

At her city club  
Were something in diplomacy  
So we put her on the hit list  
Of a common cunning linguist  
A master of many tongues  
And now she eases gently  
From her Austin to her Bentley  
Suddenly she feels so young

She stole my heart and turned me 'round  
'Till I didn't know right from wrong  
She whispered words of kindness  
I'd never ever heard before  
Golden words and silver tongue  
Till I really couldn't take no more
