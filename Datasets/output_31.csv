Dolly Parton,I Don't Want You Around Me Anymore,/d/dolly+parton/i+dont+want+you+around+me+anymore_20186339.html,"You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart  
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by  
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and  
I don't care honey if you love me or not  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore  
  
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day  
I should grow up stop acting like a child  
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do  
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while  
  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore

Dolly Parton,I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,/d/dolly+parton/i+forgot+more+than+youll+ever+know_20041662.html,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You think you know the smile on her lips  
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You think you'll find heaven of bliss  
In each caress, in each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me  
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.  
You think she's yours, to have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

Dolly Parton,I Get A Kick Out Of You,/d/dolly+parton/i+get+a+kick+out+of+you_20209575.html,"I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all  
So tell me why should it be true?  
That I get a kick out of you  
Some people go for cocaine  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrifically too  
Still I get a kick out of you  
  
I get a kick every time I see you  
Standin' there before me  
I get a kick though it's clear to see  
You obviously don't adore me, aww  
  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothin' to do  
Still I get a kick out of you  
Yes I get a kick out of you

Don Henley,All She Wants To Do Is Dance,/d/don+henley/all+she+wants+to+do+is+dance_20042046.html,"They're pickin' up the prisoners  
And puttin 'em in a pen  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
Rebels been rebels  
Since I don't know when  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
Molotov cocktail, the local drink  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
They mix 'em up right  
In the kitchen sink  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
Crazy people walkin' round with blood in their eyes  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance  
Wild-eyed pistols wavers who ain't afraid to die  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
And make romance  
She can't feel the heat  
Comin' off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
  
Well the government bugged the men's room  
In the local disco lounge  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
To keep the boys from sellin'  
All the weapons they could scrounge  
And all she wants to do is dance  
  
But that don't keep the boys from makin' a buck or two  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
The still can sell the army  
All the drugs that they can do  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Well we barely make the airport  
For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout  
They said, ""don't come back here Yankee""  
But if I ever do  
I'll bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
Never mind the heat  
Comin' off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
All she wants to do is dance

Don Henley,Annabel,/d/don+henley/annabel_20042077.html,"I watch you sleeping  
My weary heart rises up on wings  
I hear your laughter  
Something deep down inside me sings  
  
Way down here in the land of cotton  
You were born on a rainy day  
Since then, sweet things long forgotten  
They just keep flooding back my way  
  
Oh child, I cannot tell you how the time just flies  
But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies  
These days, your bright dreams are all I want to see  
Sleep tight, Annabel  
You can always count on me  
  
In this cold world, folks will judge you  
Though they don't know you at all  
And I may not be there to catch you  
Anytime that you might fall  
  
But, you got my hard head  
And your mother's grace  
All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face  
And I know in the end you'll be who you will be  
  
So sleep tight, Annabel  
You can always count on me

Don Henley,Can Love Stand The Test,/d/don+henley/can+love+stand+the+test_20978839.html,"Did I lose your love a long time ago  
Or did I just wear it out? Baby, I don't know  
Seems like anymore we're not on the same page  
In the same book, or on the same stage  
  
We say the words, but they feel all wrong  
Like a happy blues, like a sad love song  
How two people can bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
A long time ago, or was it just yesterday  
Why would we fall out of love? Baby, can you say?  
Don't look at me like I'm stranger now  
Have I changed that much? Baby, tell me how  
How two people could bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
We said forever, for always, for good  
But the years were not impressed  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness

Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
We'll be happy together, unhappy together

Don Henley,"Damn It, Rose",/d/don+henley/damn+it+rose_20042078.html,"Maybe just a good night's sleep  
Would have changed your troubled mind  
From that rather permanent decision  
So tragic, so unkind  
Now, pain is what you've given  
And sleep is what you'll get  
So far away from that sweet baby child  
Who hardly knew you yet  
  
Now he'll grow up to be a fighter  
Full of anger, full of shame  
Like all the other haunted children  
Who wonder why they came  
And he'll be in and out of trouble  
Until he stands up or he falls  
But there will always be a shadow there  
No matter how it goes  
Damn it, Rose  
  
Is this another cryptic message  
Or some kind of cosmic quiz  
If there's a lesson to be learned from this  
Well, I don't know what it is  
  
You could have given us the finger  
Much more constructively than that  
Now I sit here with the MTV  
And your bloated, Burmese cat  
We're being treated to the wisdom  
Of some puffed up little fart  
Doing exactly what I used to do  
Pretensions to anarchy and art  
He speaks the language of a warrior  
He mounts his misinformed attack  
He wears the clothes of a dissenter  
But there's a logo on his back  
And it's a hollow rebellion  
As rebellions mostly are  
It's just another raging tempest in a jar  
  
And the seasons keep on changing  
And the wind blows hot and cold  
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide  
As it ebbs and flows  
Damn it, Rose

Just give me something-something I can use

In her eye  
It's interesting when people die  
Give us dirty laundry  
  
Can we film the operation?  
Is the head dead yet?  
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a  
Running bet  
Get the widow on the set!  
We need dirty laundry  
  
You don't really need to find out what's going on  
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone  
Just leave well enough alone  
Eat your dirty laundry  
  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're up

Kick 'em all around  
  
Dirty little secrets  
Dirty little lies  
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie  
We love to cut you down to size  
We love dirty laundry  
  
We can do ""The Innuendo""  
We can dance and sing  
When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing  
We all know that crap is king  
Give us dirty laundry!

That will disclose  
What everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you're in trouble  
Everybody knows what you've been through  
From the bloody cross on  
To the beach at Malibu  
Everybody knows it's coming apart  
Take one last look at this sacred heart  
Before it blows

Don Henley,Gimme What You Got,/d/don+henley/gimme+what+you+got_20042056.html,"Baby picks off your plate--yours look's better  
And she throws hers on the floor  
Here, in the home of the brave  
And the land of the free  
The first word that baby learns is more  
  
So you're out there floating like a big, puffy cloud  
With the pool and the charcoal  
And the kids and the wife  
Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted  
And you step out into life  
  
And it's still gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
Now it's take and take takeover, takeover  
It's all take and never give  
All these trumped up towers  
They're just golden showers  
Where are people supposed to live?  
  
You can arm yourself, alarm yourself  
But there's nowhere you can run  
'Cause a man with a briefcase  
Can steal more money  
Than any man with a gun  
  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
Said gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
You got the price of admission--  
You don't have to ask permission  
To take somethin' from another man  
You cross a lawyer with the godfather, baby  
Make you an offer that you can't understand  
  
From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington  
From men to women to men  
It's a nation of noses pressed up against the glass  
They've seen it on the TV  
And they want it pretty fast  
  
You spend your whole life  
Just pilin' it up there  
You got stacks and stacks and stacks  
Then, Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder  
But you don't see no hearses with luggage racks  
  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got

Standing at attention  
Wrapped in stars and stripes

And the nonexistent pipes

And someone remembered my name  
But I knew I was doin' just fine  
And it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Well I guess for some  
Revenge is sweet  
Though it be once removed  
I hope you feel better  
I don't know what you proved  
Well, yonder comes the Emperor, boys  
He sure looks fine in blue  
I hope you feel better, babe  
I know you're scared too  
Well it sure makes you wonder  
The things that some people will say  
They can see black and white but they  
Don't seem to notice the gray  
What a price for a victimless crime  
When it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Yeah, it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine

I don't know if even Heaven knows  
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true  
Now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
I know people hurt you, so bad  
They don't know the damage they can do,  
And it makes me so sad  
How we knock each other down just like  
Children on a playground  
Even after that ol' sun went down  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Or blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
Oh darlin', baby, this is still a shady little town  
And sometimes it's so hard to smile  
For the world, for the camera  
And still have something left  
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody  
Just take good care of yourself  
  
I'm not easy to live with  
I know that it's true  
You're no picnic either, babe  
That's one of the things I loved about you  
Time will come around when we need to settle down  
Got to get of this merry-go-round  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking you're light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world

There's just not enough love in the world  
Not enough love in the world  
In the world  
In the world

It'll all be done  
We'll all be good and crispy  
But we'll still be number one  
And if things go from bad to worse  
We can still kill them if they kill us first  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner

Hell-bent  
Heaven sent  
It all got started by an accident  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner

You should be home, but you're not  
A room full of noise and dangerous boys  
Still makes you thirsty and hot  
I heard about you and that man  
There's just one thing I don't understand  
You say he's a liar and he put out  
Your fire  
How come you still got his gun in your hand?  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
You got your stories to tell  
Victim of love, it's such an easy part  
And you know how to play it so well  
  
Some people never come clean  
I think you know what I mean  
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire  
Looking for love in between  
  
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine  
This ain't no time to be cool  
And tell all your girlfriends,  
You ""been around the world"" friends  
That talk is for losers and fools  
  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
I could be wrong, but I'm not  
Victim of love, we're not so far apart  
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

And in the spring of '48  
Mao tse-tung got quite irate  
And he kicked that old dictator chiang  
Out of the state of china  
Chiang kai-shek came down in formosa  
And they armed the island of quemoy

Don McLean,Aftermath,/d/don+mclean/aftermath_20202344.html,"Windows in a silent room, sunlight burns the walls to black  
Angles and dimensions melt while colors drip and pillows crack  
Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet  
The ribbon film of separate frames lying curled up at my feet  
  
The film is just a snake design and the photographs are fading fast  
These are not memories of mine I have no future, no past  
  
I've seen a thousand afternoons dissolve into the night  
Like sugar crystals on a spoon they disappear from sight  
  
Gray days from the crispest morning to the warmest afternoon in this room  
  
And I like to draw the face I saw so long ago  
My image in the mirror tells the jagged lines which way to go  
  
The black and white description of the sole survivor of the Holocaust  
All the rest were lost  
  
Do you see this paper face? It has no color or no mood  
My eyes are ageless, as am I. I need no sleep, I need no food  
I am a king, but like a child the other children laugh at me  
Tongues of fire, wagging wild they dance around me merrily  
  
I'll kill them all and if I fail I'll kill whoever I can find  
Then they'll beg me to be kind  
  
My eyes have seen far more than eyes can ever tell  
This planet plunged through mushroom fires of earthly hell  
  
I know that my sweet Jesus said that he'd return  
But Babylon has fallen and the cities burn

Well, when you told me that you loved me  
And I gave my heart to you  
Oh, well, I wondered  
If there could be any truth in love so new  
  
I was lost in a fool's paradise  
Good and lost in a fool's paradise  
  
The whole world was my kingdom  
And your love, the gem in my crown  
But when I saw you glance at a new romance  
You know my love came tumbling down  
  
Oh well, you treat me a kinda coolish  
And you never let me know  
That you think I'm being foolish  
Because I love you so  
  
I'll still get lost in a fool's paradise

Don McLean,Great Big Man,/d/don+mclean/great+big+man_20208710.html,"Rust on your fingers, you got trouble at your feet.  
Keep the home fires burning, but look out for the heat  
'cause there's a man at the window who knows just what you think,  
And there's a water boy behind you who won't give you a drink  
  
Well it's a hard, hard time, no easy road in sight,  
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight.  
  
When it comes to dying, no matter what you tell,  
They'll let you into a heaven 'cause you lived your life in hell.  
Well they've got no way to reward you but to let those breezes blow,  
And you've got nothing left to do but to let your anger show.  
  
'Cause it's a hard, hard time, no easy road in sight,  
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight.  
  
Think about your baby, think about your wife,  
Think about your banker who's trying to take your life.  
Think about this planet that's rolling through the night.  
Oh can you turn your back on such a great big fight?  
  
You got the muscle, big man, you got the power,  
But you're getting weaker with each passing hour.  
Just like a flame in the rain, like a light in the night,  
Well if it's you that must stay, well then it's you that must fight!  
  
'Cause it's a hard, hard time, your future's not bright,  
It takes a great big man to win a great big  
Great big man to win a great big fight.

I had a fight with mama and she said she couldn't stand me.

Well I'm older now than I was the day I vanished.  
You might not even know me if you saw me passin' by.  
Others take your place in the dark world of the banished.  
On vicious streets where no one hears me cry.  
  
Well you can't run, you can't hide  
turn your face, walk inside.  
Can't close your doors, because I'm yours.  
Have you seen me?  
  
Well I'm fighting in Nicaragua, I'm fighting in Afghanistan.  
In Israel I wear a gun, in Palestine a rock is in my hand.  
In Africa you see me starve, in America they just throw me away.  
But I'm making history that other kids will read about some day

They're talkin' murder in the states,  
They're talkin' cash to get a fix.  
They're talkin' virus in the bed,

Don McLean,Homeless Brother,/d/don+mclean/homeless+brother_20215539.html,"I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,  
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.  
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,  
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,  
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,  
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.  
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,  
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.  
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,  
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.  
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,  
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,  
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.  
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,  
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,  
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,  
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't  
Pretend,  
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brothe

Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right

You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get.

It's all so complicated,  
The thread of my own thoughts seems to be disappearing into what seems  
To be a logical conclusion.  
  
I guess I just ran out of ideas.  
I've heard a million songs about this and that,  
And they gave me satisfaction  
But I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
  
Now comes the second verse and I have to at least keep the measures  
Straight.  
It's been a long time now and i'm really insecure about it all.  
I guess I didn't like seeing all the things I saw, Who needs it?  
It's been a little painful and I hope I don't like the pain,  
Cause I'd hate to think of myself like that  
  
'Cause I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
I like the old things, But I just can't give up the idea

Forgot the first creed in the code of love.

When did he start to go beatin' your drum?

I'm cryin' on a gravel shoulder.

Look where you're goin'.  
Give me a signal.  
Some way of knowin'.  
Well now who's at the wheel in the life that drove by.  
I could swear it was her made me shift into high.  
She's got those dangerous curves  
And they're wrackin' my nerves  
She always wiggles and swerves.  
She's gonna give her driver everything he deserves.  
  
Well now who could want this to lie here alone  
With a palate of bricks, a pillow of stone.  
Well to think that one kiss pulled me out o' my zone  
And I wonder what's the change inside her?  
This road has got a long divider.

Wise men are down on their knees  
And the Fruitman of Freeway will sell you his cars  
When he's sure that you can't find the keys  
And the ladies on Magdalene Lane  
All worship the sun and the sand  
And the migrants who come can't complain  
For this is their promised land  
  
MGM studios can't make the nut  
They're auctioning Dorothy's shoes  
Gable is gone, the good witch is a slut  
And I've got the parking-lot blues  
The wizard brought benzedrine smiles  
And he never let Dorothy doze  
Ha- she died as she walked down the aisle  
And all that remains is her clothes  
  
Over the rainbow a Kansas tornado  
Can twist up a little girl's head  
Aunt Em's on relief and the tin man's a thief  
And even the wizard can't wake the dead  
  
The prophet has come to the kingdom of lights  
But there's no one to listen or learn  
And the saviour performs for the prophet's delight  
While dissenters are banished or burned  
And the heretics beg to be heard  
But the saviour's on tour for the week  
Salvation is found in his word  
If only he'd learn how to speak!  
  
And Lincoln is laughing with Amos and Andy  
Concerning the great Civil War  
And Paul Revere sleeps with the worst-looking creeps  
While revolution's knocking at his door  
  
Magdalene Lane is the red-light domain  
Where everyone's soul is for sale  
A piece of your heart will do for a start  
You can send us the rest in the mail  
For we have our own families to feed  
And we can't let them starve just for you  
But we'd rather not watch while you bleed  
So come back in an hour when you're through

Sleep is lovely when you sleep next to me.

And they come from the south

Hungry and hopeless Americans  
The orphans of wealth and of adequate health  
Disowned by this nation they live in  
  
And with weather-worn hands  
On bread lines they stand  
Yet but one more degradation  
Yes, and they're treated like tramps  
While we sell them food stamps  
This thriving and prosperous nation  
  
And the rain falls and blows through their window  
And the snow falls and blows through their door  
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  
When the tides rise, they cover the floor  
  
And with roaches and rickets and rats in the thickets  
Infested, diseased, and decaying  
With rags and no shoes and skin sores that ooze  
By the poisonous pools they are playing  
  
In shacks of two rooms that are rotting wood tombs  
With corpses breathing inside them  
Yes, and we pity their plight as they call in the night  
And we do all that we can do to

I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
I don't have happiness and I guess I never will again.  
When you walked out on me in came old misery,

She knows your future, she knows what it's worth  
Sister Fatima has God-given powers  
And on 42nd Street a shop that sells flowers  
Is her palace, come and be healed  
  
She knows all your business, your health and your ills  
She'll counsel your weddings, divorces and wills  
For full restoration five dollars an hour  
And with each consultation a free holy flower  
And if she likes you, well you can have two  
  
And I came from nowhere like you and your friend  
My searching and wandering went on without end  
My future was dim, my spirit was crushed  
In one sacred moment my questions were hushed  
  
I'm a servant of fate in this garden of truth  
A humble recruit of the taffeta booth  
Where all things are known but few are revealed  
Where sins are forgotten and sickness is healed  
For five dollars the flower is free

Don McLean,Tapestry,/d/don+mclean/tapestry_20042104.html,"Every thread of creation is held in position  
By still other strands of things living.  
In an earthly tapestry hung from the skyline  
Of smoldering cities so gray and so vulgar,  
As not to be satisfied with their own negativity  
But needing to touch all the living as well.  
  
Every breeze that blows kindly is one crystal breath  
We exhale on the blue diamond heaven.  
As gentle to touch as the hands of the healer.  
As soft as farewells whispered over the coffin.  
We're poisoned by venom with each breath we take,  
From the brown sulfur chimney and the black highway snake.  
  
Every dawn that breaks golden is held in suspension  
Like the yoke of the egg in albumen.  
Where the birth and the death of unseen generations  
Are interdependent in vast orchestration  
And painted in colors of tapestry thread.  
When the dying are born and the living are dead.  
  
Every pulse of your heartbeat is one liquid moment  
That flows through the veins of your being.  
Like a river of life flowing on since creation.  
Approaching the sea with each new generation.  
You're now just a stagnant and rancid disgrace  
That is rapidly drowning the whole human race.  
  
Every fish that swims silent, every bird that flies freely,  
Every doe that steps softly.  
Every crisp leaf that falls, all the flowers that grow  
On this colorful tapestry, somehow they know.  
That if man is allowed to destroy all they need.  
He will soon have to pay with his life, for his greed.

Don McLean,The More You Pay,/d/don+mclean/the+more+you+pay_20264315.html,"The auctioneer said, I'm not through yet,  
Here's a horse the likes of which you've never seen,  
And the straw hats in the sun, with a face beneath each one,  
Shown doubtful and the auctioneer got mean.  
Do you think that you can find a horse like this every day?  
I don't think there's any better on this earth,  
And the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
Then out she came, a snow-white mare,  
Prancin' and a dancin' in the silver sun,  
They watched her from behind, as she did her bump and grind,  
Walkin' naked, sad and graceful for their fun.  
Oh how I wished I could afford that lady painted white,  
A queen with high nobility of birth,  
But the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
My pockets hung with empty blues,  
Silent heels were standin' on my growin' pains,  
My bid was not too bad, two bits was all I had,  
And the stable boy just handed me the reins.  
Well the gallery went wild, and the auctioneer half smiled,  
What we don't sell we shoot or give away,  
'Cause the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
And where was the boy, who rode on her back,  
With his arms holding tight round her neck?  
How tightly he clung,  
When they both were young,  
And fate had not let this poor girl be so  
Disgraced.

Don McLean,Three Flights Up,/d/don+mclean/three+flights+up_20315971.html,"On the first floor' On the first floor  
On the first floor there's a young girl reeling  
Her body's numb and without feeling  
As illusions dance on the midnight ceiling  
Now she's falling, now she's kneeling  
It's almost like she's bowed in prayer  
A savior she's about to bear  
She screams for help, but no one's there  
On the first floor  
On the first floor people walk the halls  
But none can hear her desperate calls  
There is no sound beyond the walls  
So to the telephone she crawls  
She telephones her only friend  
The one on whom she can depend  
But the phone rings on without an end  
Then rings no more On the first floor  
There's a party on the second floor  
And through the picture window you can see them all  
They're laughing and they're dancing  
Admiring the Renoir that's hanging on the wall  
But in the master bedroom where the coats are piled high  
A silent, saddened lady thinks of what it's like to die  
And as she dwells on all the years she still has left to face  
She wonders how she'll ever find someone to take his place  
Then suddenly she's jarred by the ringing of the phone  
Oh, why do you ring now, just when I want to be alone?  
So she walks into the bathroom and drinks some water from a cup  
But the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up  
My family was very poor  
So I worked hard to be secure  
I married one I had to wed  
And not the one I loved instead  
When I was young my blood ran wild  
But we stayed married for the child  
Now three flights up, I'm all alone  
My wife is dead, my child is grown  
My daughter leads a wayward life  
She's been a failure as a wife  
And though she lives just one floor down  
She never calls or comes around  
Step off the platform and onto the train  
Look out your window and into the rain  
Watch all the buildings that pass as you ride  
And count all the stories that go on inside  
And then ask yourself if it must be this way  
Should walls and doors and plaster ceilings  
Separate us from each others' feelings?

Where has all the love gone and what have we become?  
Storm clouds full of thunder move silent as they drum.  
And when they're gone, we'll be fine, till tomorrow.  
Though I hope it won't rain.  
  
You will be mine and my sorrow will take wings in the morning.  
High above the heavens a rainbow paints the sky.  
White doves sing their songs of love.  
I watch them as they fly and wonder.

Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and the daffodils  
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colors on the snowy linen land  
  
Now I understand what you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
How you tried to set them free  
They would not listen, they did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
Starry, starry night  
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds in violet haze  
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue  
Colors changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand  
  
Now I understand what you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen, they did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
For they could not love you  
But still your love was true  
And when no hope was left in sight  
On that starry, starry night  
You took your life as lovers often do  
But I could have told you, Vincent  
This world was never meant  
For one as beautiful as you  
  
Starry, starry night  
Portraits hung in empty halls  
Frameless heads on nameless walls  
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget  
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ragged men in ragged clothes  
A silver thorn, a bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  
  
Now I think I know what you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen, they're not listening still  
Perhaps they never will

Nor forsake you and His Word is true

And His mercies - they will never end

When you find the perfect love  
Let it fill you up, hey baby  
  
Dim all the lights sweet honey

No need to worry darlin'  
'Cause it's for eternity  
  
Love just don't come easy  
This you know I understand  
Want to be your woman  
If you'll be my man  
Let yourself go freely and I'll  
Show you things that you've dreamed of  
Don't think that your dreaming  
We've found the perfect love  
And I'm like a cup, come fill me up  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way, whoa baby  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna dance the night away  
  
Do what you want  
You can use me all up  
Take me bottom to top  
Don't leave anything undone  
  
No, no, no do it tonight  
You know the moments are right  
Turn my brown body white  
Come on dim all the lights  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna steal your heart away, hey baby  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'

There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance

To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man I loved

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it  
  
Tell him to just get out,  
  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:  
Enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough

Don't pretend that is right when it's over

No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)

Donna Summer,Eyes,/d/donna+summer/eyes_20042221.html,"Right outside the window something's happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
You walk away and see yourself in retrospect  
Remember all of love's first visions  
Step aside try to see just what went wrong  
Living together isn't easy all the time  
  
I believe in you if you believe in me, oh  
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah  
I know we can  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'llstand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned

Street in L.A.  
She was preaching the gospel  
She was singing how Jesus saves  
When a crowd of passing tourists  
Looked to see what they could see  
You know before they know it she had  
Them all down on their knees  
I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And I'm going to heaven by and by  
'cause I already been through hell  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
Now Jesus was a little lamb, his fleece  
Was white as snow  
And every where that Jesus went  
This lamb is sure to go  
Well I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And I'm going to heaven by and by  
'cause I saved my soul from going to hell  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus  
Look at the sheep 'cause they're  
Running fast  
They wanna make it through the gates  
At last  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus

Donna Summer,I Love You,/d/donna+summer/i+love+you_10087851.html,"From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they really do  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes I do  
You say ""I love you""

And easy-living girl with love for sale  
  
That's what they call her the lady of the night  
No one seems to know her name  
And even less about the place  
From where she came  
  
Every evening when the night is close at hand  
You'll find the lady on the rue d'avignon  
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly  
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can  
  
Don't try to change this lady of the night  
She's a lot like you and me  
And less than what she seems to be

She's a woman of the world  
(she is the lady of the night)  
With lots of loving for sale  
(she is the lady of the night)  
Lady lady of the night  
  
Round here they call her the lady of the night  
In a perfume hotel room  
Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn  
She's no beginner this lady of the night  
Never try that funny stuff  
'cause lady can be tough  
Be warned!

Donna Summer,Lamb Of God,/d/donna+summer/lamb+of+god_20042235.html,"[Spoken:]  
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea  
During the time of king Herod  
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked  
""where is the one who is born king of the Jews?  
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him""  
  
Lord we have traveled far  
Torn and weary guided by your star  
There before us the living king  
Hallelujah his praises sing  
  
Herod with a evil plan  
Kill the babies  
Came his bold command  
He tried to alter god's holy plan  
God has saved him  
The son of man  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
Three kings from a distance come  
Bearing gifts for the only one  
Shout to heaven sound the drum  
Tell the nations  
The lord has come  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
He came to bring us his peace  
He came to bring us his joy  
To bring us love  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The precious lamb of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god

And so the wise men the shepherds  
The ox and the lamb  
The angels above  
All rejoiced at god's command  
As a star shine from heaven  
This new king to adorn  
On that very first christmas  
When Jesus Christ was born

Donna Summer,Love's About To Change My Heart,/d/donna+summer/loves+about+to+change+my+heart_20042199.html,"I never needed someone  
''cause I always led a life of my own  
Never waited for the ring of the 'phone  
Never had anyone here  
When I got home  
But love's about to change my heart  
  
I'm waiting for the doorbell to chime  
When I always lived one day at a time  
I thought that I was getting on fine  
Never felt I was alone  
'til you change your mind  
Love's about to change my heart  
  
Could a day be so long  
When I always felt secure and so strong  
And all the time as I went along  
Never thought I would desire  
So much to belong  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart, ooh  
  
Never ever thought the sky was so blue  
Never ever thought I'd feel so new  
Always thought I'd know what to do  
But I guess I wasn't counting on you  
  
What did I know  
I always felt so much on control  
I thought I'd make it all on my own  
Never thought I would forget  
All I have known  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change, change, change

With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy can't you see  
There's noone more important to me  
Baby can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place we're there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my love's in there hiding  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over

They meet me at a time when I'm calm and feeling fine  
But the captain of my soul is always on board  
He rocks me in his arms  
While I'm riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
Jesus hold me in his arms  
And I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Although clouds become high  
Jesus holds me while I ride  
I find safety in the Master's arms  
While I'm riding through a storm  
  
I have no fear on the raging sea  
Knowing Jesus is there for me  
He can speak to the winds and the wave  
And make them behave  
All power's in his hand  
On sea or dry land  
I find safety in my Master's arms

When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together  
Back together anymore.....

That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Donna Summer,Theme To Dream A Lot ( I Will Live For Love),/d/donna+summer/theme+to+dream+a+lot+i+will+live+for+love_20506813.html,"Theme to Dream a Lot (I will live for love) By, Donna Summers  
  
There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love

And the rain just keeps coming on down  
Well I cry to myself  
So many things that I've done wrong  
Now I'm watching you walk out  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Where is he going  
How is he what is he gonna do  
Where is he going  
And what on earth will he be going through oh  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Sing this song forever

Donna Summer,To Turn The Stone,/d/donna+summer/to+turn+the+stone_20042275.html,"The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Donna Summer,True Love Survives,/d/donna+summer/true+love+survives_20042276.html,"On big alley stands a lady waiting  
For awhile  
Acting out an untold story like a  
Wounded child  
But the mystery of the circumstance  
Won't hide  
She believes true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Waiting for her long lost lover  
Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives  
True love survives  
  
Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever  
Only love will last forever

Donna Summer,Virgin Mary (german Edition Track),/d/donna+summer/virgin+mary+german+edition+track_20553434.html,"Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
""I was a lovely girl in my younger days""  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought  
Jealous talk and nonsense

It's the pain  
Of just being young

Of a voice unheard  
Of a face  
Speaking silent words  
It's the hope  
That the time goes by  
Take you upon a wing  
Teach your soul to fly  
It's a wish

Caught in a waking dream  
Did you mean what you said  
An' did you say what you mean  
  
Mere words, fade away  
You had a language I couldn't miss  
It was on your lips, but  
You didn't get me that way  
It was something you said

There's a town south of the border  
South of el paso they say  
Where the nights are long and the winds are warm  
And the women they love to play  
In an old adobe tavern  
Mescal flows like water  
And rita will dance on your table so fine  
You are bound to place your order

I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding down the highway south of the border  
As I ride into town and the dust settles down  
And the mariachi music is playing  
I buy me a room from a guy named luis  
It's just up the stairs and it's waiting  
Downstairs rita is dancing  
Just the way her mother has taught her  
So I settle down for the show and a beer  
And wait for that mother's daughter  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding  
When the morning comes and I wake up  
To the sounds of the people below  
There's a note on my bed that is easily read  
Buenos dias and a kiss when you go  
As I ride out of town with my face to the sun  
And the dust is trailing behind  
Soon I'll go back to this sleepy old town  
Back where I know I can find

Watchin' the golden crops in the field just growin' without a sound  
I was a boy raised in the country and it's still a part of me  
And you see no matter where I go it's a beautiful memory  
Rise with sun at the break of day, lookin' out my window  
It's the same as yesterday  
Sittin' under an old oak tree, pickin' my guitar in the shade  
That old tree spreadin' over my head is the closest friend I made  
Just me and some lonely wooden music, floatin' through air  
The grass is rustlin' and the birds are singin' and my heart don't have a care  
Still another day finds me in the fields, sweat is soakin' up my ragged
clothes  
But I'd rather work than steal  
Watchin' the sun settle down over open Texas land, looking at the cattle and
the horses runnin' wild as they can  
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done  
When you were finished workin' in the fields, there was chores at home to be
done  
I was always hearin' music, always wanna play me some  
As a full-time friend or the way to ease the end of a woman that swayed me
some  
Hearin' those tunes always had a way of soothin' out my soul  
When times got hard and work got slow it was music that kept me whole  
Sun beatin' down through the trees, gets so hot bring a workin' man to his
knees  
Part of my heart, part of my soul, part of a melody  
Hands are clappin' and people swayin' in simple harmony  
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done  
When you finished workin' in the fields there was chores at home to be done  
Late in the evenin' on the front porch when the sun is settin' in the west  
Me and the boys pass around the bottle and sing what we like best  
Sing about our wives, sing about our children, singin' out the Delta blues  
We're simple folks and we like it that way, got nothin' left to lose

Doobie Brothers,Wild Ride,/d/doobie+brothers/wild+ride_20550858.html,"As the wind blows down the canyon,  
And the rain falls on the river,  
I can hear her song of wishes.  
I can feel her body shiver.  
Her boots are made of feathers,  
Flying as she runs  
Across this painted desert,  
With a suitcase full of guns.  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
Near the old abandoned drive-in,  
There's a brand new Motel 6.  
It's hard to make a livin',  
But you work to get your kicks.  
You don't know how you got here,  
But it comes as no surprise.  
When the rust gets in your engine,  
And the dust gets in your eyes.  
  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
From Mobile to Milwaukee,  
Seattle, St. Joe.  
From Memphis to Miami,  
To the streets of Tokyo.  
Take a trip among the livin',  
Make a circle in the sky.  
It's a good day for believin',  
That we're never gonna die.

Sailed in a river of  
Crystal light into a sea of dew  
  
Now where are you going  
And what do you (A)wish  
The old moon asked of the three  
Well, we're going out fishing  
For herring fish that live in the  
Beautiful sea  
  
Nets of Silver and  
Gold have we said  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

A song  
As they rocked in their wooden

And the wind that sped them all  
Night long ruffled the waves of dew  
  
Well the little stars were the  
Herring fish that lived  
In the beautiful sea  
Now cast your nets wherever  
You wish never afeared are we  
So sang the stars to the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod  
  
All night long their nets they  
Threw to the stars and  
The twinkling foam  
Then down from the skies came  
The wooden shoe bringing  
The fisherman home  
  
Twas all so pretty a sight  
It seemed as if it could not be  
And some folks thought it was  
A dream they dreamed  
Of sailingthe beautiful sea  
But I shall name you the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken, Blynken and Nod  
  
Now Wynken and Blynken are  
Two little eyes and Nod is a  
Little head  
And the wooden shoe that  
Sailed the sky is a wee one's  
Trundle bed  
So close your eyes while  
Mother sings of the beautiful  
Sights that be  
And you will see wonderful  
Things as you rock on the misty sea  
Where the old moon rocks

Making crazy sounds  
And everybody putting  
Everybody else down  
And all the dead bodies  
Piled up in mounds

My wild love went ridin'  
She rode to the sea  
She gathered together  
Some shells for her head  
She rode and she rode on  
She rode for a while  
Then stopped for an evenin'  
And lay her head down  
She rode on to Christmas  
She rode to the farm  
She rode to Japan  
And we entered a town  
By this time the river  
Had changed one degree  
She asked for the people  
To let her go free  
My wild love is crazy  
She screams like a bird  
She moans like a cat  
When she wants to be heard  
My wild love went ridin'  
She rode for an hour  
She rode and she rested  
And then she rode on  
Ride, c'mon

Who called these dead to dance?  
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?  
Was it the wilderness children?  
Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?  
I called you up to anoint the earth  
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin  
I called you to wish you well  
To glory in self like a new monster  
And now I call you to pray

Doors,The Ghost Song,/d/doors/the+ghost+song_20042659.html,"Awake.  
Shake dreams from your hair  
My pretty child, my sweet one.  
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day  
The day's divinity  
First thing you see.  
  
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon  
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side  
And we laugh like soft, mad children  
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy  
The music and voices are all around us.  
  
Choose they croon the ancient ones  
The time has come again  
Choose now, they croon  
Beneath the moon  
Beside an ancient lake  
  
Enter again the sweet forest  
Enter the hot dream  
Come with us  
Everything is broken up and dances.  
  
Indians scattered,  
On dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's,  
Fragile eggshell mind  
  
We have assembled inside,  
This ancient and insane theater  
To propagate our lust for life,  
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets.  
  
The barns have stormed  
The windows kept,  
And only one of all the rest  
To dance and save us  
From the divine mockery of words,  
Music inflames temperament.  
  
Ooh great creator of being  
Grant us one more hour,  
To perform our art  
And perfect our lives.  
  
We need great golden copulations,  
  
When the true kings murderers  
Are allowed to roam free,  
A thousand magicians arise in the land  
Where are the feast we are promised?

With no Bromo Seltzer handy,  
I don't even shake.  
  
Men are not a new sensation,  
I've done pretty well I think,  
But this half pint imitation  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A whimpering, simpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree  
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.  
  
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
He's a fool and don't I know it,  
But a fool can have his charms,  
I'm in love and don't I know it,  
Like a babe in arms.  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation,  
Lately I've not slept a wink,  
Since this half pint imitation,  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,  
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,

And worship the trousers that cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
When he talks, he is seeking,  
Words to get,.off his chest.  
Horizontally speaking  
He's at his very best.  
  
Vexed again, perplexed again,  
Thank god I can be oversexed again.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Wise at last, my eyes at last,  
Are cutting you down to your size at last,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Burned a lot but learned a lot,  
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,  
Life was so hard to bear,  
Now my heart's antiseptic,  
Since you moved out of there.  
  
Romance finis.  
Your chance finis.  
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.

Takes me nearer to heaven than anyone's allowed to do  
When your heart is talkin' I feel like I'm walkin  
On a cloud with someone like you  
Some day I'll find someone I can boast to,  
Somebody to hug a bug in a rug to snuggle up close to  
And whenever I do, do you know th ewho,  
Who I'll give the most to.  
You prey on my mind, stay till I find,  
Someone like you

Wish we could get together on  
Tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
Love 'em, dozens of 'em

And when I'm through, what do I do  
I stamp and holler for more  
  
You can have the fourth position on my list  
Must admit your kisses would be missed  
But how in the world could I exist  
Without tacos, enchiladas and beans

They make me kind of sick  
But I love them

And I knew the spark of love was still burning

And of course Prince Charming is the theme  
The he, for me.  
Although I realize as well as you  
It is seldom that a dream comes true,  
To me it's clear  
That he'll appear.  
  
Some day he'll come along, the man I love  
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love  
And when he comes my way,  
I'll do my best to make him stay.  
  
He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand  
And in a little while, he'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word.  
  
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,  
Maybe Monday, maybe not  
Still I'm sure to meet him one day  
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.  
  
He'll build a little home just meant for two  
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?  
And so, all else above,  
I'm waiting for the man I love.

And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle and another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rockaway rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me  
Stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love

Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway

That look just like virgins but trust they down to go  
Discussin' life and all our common goals  
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll  
Look how the champagne diamonds flow  
Find dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low  
I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'  
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'  
These other rappers gettin' at it very you feelin  
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'  
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'  
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant  
People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays  
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days  
Damn I guess it does what the message was  
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because  
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us  
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us  
Yeah, I know these n-ggas miss the mean lyrics  
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit  
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up  
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader  
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up  
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up  
Who you like, tell me who it is  
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list  
I should call it a night but f-ck it I can't resist  
This one is for all my n-ggas from my city tryin to diss  
Without a responce from me you really fail to exist  
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the sh-t  
I swear, aghh p-ssy n-gga get your bread up  
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up  
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up  
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup  
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up  
  
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better  
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff  
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club  
Damn that n-gga always kept it so hood  
Back when we would smoke good  
At the oakwoods  
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch  
Now we just f-ckin all the b-tches they warned us about  
Scared for the first time everything has clicked  
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict  
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked  
To write a chapter in history this sh-t has got me sick  
Lyrics courtesy of www.Killerhiphop.com  
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split  
Cause this truly is some sh-t I don't expect you all to get  
I'm nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team
in  
Throwin up in a huddle n-gga Willie beamin  
Were still throwin touchdown passes  
And tore his frame glasses  
Hopin that someone catch it  
People say that oh drake we started to miss it  
But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want?  
And my best chris tucker impression  
Ducking your questions  
F-ck your suggestions  
Money gets all of my love and affection  
Cars all black like the cover of essence  
I'm allergic to comin in second  
But I never sneeze

Uh, yeah, this want yall want

No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business  
It is a shame that a couple of 'em are off limits  
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small  
We all lust for the same women  
You know the ones we saw before we came in it  
I know he ain't trippin'  
I know I got a couple things that lil' wayne dipped in  
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it  
This shit is all about hits and misses  
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up  
Don't let them fuck your life up  
  
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up  
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up  
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man  
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand  
Young frank, suits cut right always  
Just got a couple warhol's for my hallways  
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something  
Bitches on the kid like I'm iverson of something  
Like a sixer, since I sold 680 in my first  
Drizzy drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse  
Swag!

Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man  
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy  
  
[Verse 1: drake]  
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled  
In I take q's from my big boy popz  
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater

Cause her spirit is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key

Kinda' hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing.

That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it

A student and her friends whose a model  
Finished the whole bottle... And we gonna do it big like this  
Yea and he was just practice he ain't  
In your world you can take him off ya atlas  
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with

Show me where ya tax is show me where ya hands at  
Maybe I can grasp it they say if ya get her

And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her  
Yea... And I got it together so when they

Especially when you think nobody is understanding ya  
These girls groups with they overprotected managers  
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a  
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space  
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface  
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate  
? Girl it's graces on top is such a hard place?  
Yea... But if you never even been there  
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin  
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures of ya swimwear  
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air  
I know that shit is exhausting girl  
And your mistakes are costing girl  
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl  
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting  
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different

You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it

I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me  
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me  
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest

We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer  
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass  
Then I'll probably give her my number

This is me.  
Still the same.  
They want the hits.  
I play the game.  
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.  
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.  
What up lil' braw.  
What up slumville.  
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.  
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.  
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.  
That ain't how it works.  
That ain't that how it goes.  
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.  
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.  
But I never share my thoughts,  
This is all a nigga knows.  
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.  
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.  
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.  
So every word I utter will be mine.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.

Don't take this the wrong way but  
I never cried when Pac died.  
But I probably will when Hov does.  
And if my tears hold value,  
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.  
And I'll be standing in a puddle.  
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.  
And Ima keep it honest.  
Am so tired of being subtle.  
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.  
Staring at the members of my team.  
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.  
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.  
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.  
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.  
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.  
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.  
At least I put it all in the open.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.

Fuck all y'all.  
We ignore feelings here.  
Premature millionaires.  
Welcome to my realest year.  
Yeah.  
I swear we making a killer here.  
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.  
Uh.  
But it's funny having fans.  
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,  
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.  
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.  
Yeah.  
And plus things are just so real at home  
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown  
And now security follow me everywhere  
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.  
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.  
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.  
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.  
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.  
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.  
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.  
I guess that mean they come few and far between.  
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.  
Yeah.  
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.  
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.  
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.

From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though

Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first

New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great  
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now  
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road  
These days keep going by too fast, so give anything that make shit go slow

I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche  
It's simple love, simple math  
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle on her ass  
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle  
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working  
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's  
Mba accountants, amounts they get unholy  
But mama still praying for her rubberband man  
  
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'  
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled

You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot

And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough  
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us

I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left  
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone

Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you

I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself  
I need someone I leave through the front door with  
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more  
'Cause you're not shy no more  
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more

You don't even fucking link nobody no more, you just dashing away like a Taxi  
Yo, you cheesed me dog  
  
[Verse:]  
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture  
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you  
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya  
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas  
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?  
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you  
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you  
  
[Hook:]  
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?  
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?  
What about now girl? How bout now?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Always been daddy's little angel  
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you  
I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music  
I used to always try and burn you cds of my new shit  
You be like ""who's this?""  
I be like ""me, girl.""  
You be like ""oh word, true shit?""  
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris  
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it  
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that  
Like I was average like that  
Started drinking way more than I used to  
People form habits like that, girl  
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year  
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year, guess  
I just had to pretend that year  
I ain't even see my friends that year  
Places that I should've been  
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but

Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07  
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one  
Last year I know you learned your lesson  
I could GPS you if you need addressin'  
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie  
But I'm one year older than my lil homie  
'09 they was biddin' on me  
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me  
Ok now we got some action  
Everything I said, it happened  
That boy light as Michael Jackson  
But off verses, he been blackin'  
Chasin' women a distraction  
They wan' be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Don't you see Riri right next to me?  
I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same, but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point in even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's  
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]

Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right

Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted  
I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana  
Leg hangin' out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska  
Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA  
Bustin' 1's out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious  
I feed my family with this  
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious  
I don't run out of material  
You shouldn't speak on me, period  
You try to give 'em your side of the story  
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it  
They feeling a way and won't hide it  
Niggas done being silent  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point of even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta go, they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give 'em no empathy  
I'ma have B's when I'm 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I don't know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me

Drake,It's Been A Pleasure,/d/drake/its+been+a+pleasure_20881855.html,"[Chorus]  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Reppin' 'til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin' attention  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure  
You'll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed  
So tonight we gon' do it like this  
Oh, for the H-Town  
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go  
For the H-Town  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)  
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)  
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)  
It's like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it  
Been so many places, up and down the interstate  
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate  
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So it's all good (good) don't even trip  
Believe me it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I've been all over the world  
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)  
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)  
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)  
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)  
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)  
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)  
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)  
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)  
Me and my ""II Trill"" team on the road flippin' (flippin')  
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')  
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')  
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)  
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)  
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)  
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)  
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)  
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)  
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)  
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin'
through)  
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)  
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)  
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)  
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me, understand me  
It's been a pleasure

I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure

Drake,July,/d/drake/july_20882629.html,"[Drake]  
Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks  
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart  
Like clap clap, let em fall slow  
I know you had you fears you can let them all go  
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly  
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me  
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be  
I provide protection if you open up the door for me  
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates  
Couple 'i think that we're ready's'  
Couple 'i think we should wait's'  
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight  
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes  
  
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]  
You had to change up the game  
Oh the weather is not the same  
Now there's only cloudy days  
I can't stand the rain in July  
Oh July  
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)  
But now it's getting colder  
The leafs are turning colours  
Why, it's just not our season  
The one and only reason  
Baby oh baby oh  
When summer turn into fall  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go  
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know  
Had you over every night, every night was passionate  
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident  
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong  
I wish shorty I would be with you so long  
I was planning on being something worth mentioning  
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in  
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing  
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in  
And just as I predicted here we go again  
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jhene Aiko]  
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end but then the season
changed  
[Drake]  
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)  
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World  
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby  
[Jhene Aiko]  
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime  
And I will turn into a butterfly  
I will spread my wings and fly  
And I'm too fly for the sh-t  
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please

(Yeah)  
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it  
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying  
  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
Try to control us  
You wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us  
  
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy  
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments  
I mean women inspire me to great things  
(Drake:?)  
I need to grow some fucking confidence  
And why you gotta say the last words  
And if I tell you how I really felt  
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,  
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)  
Yeah  
And that shit starts to get old  
And I don't mean to say the most  
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?  
So it bothers me when you hang with hoes

That don't love you back  
Love them anyway

Put us both in a position where we can both succeed

When you know, you know I'm the same  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm  
Fuck it I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me  
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum  
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from  
Yeah, you know me well nigga  
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga  
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again?  
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again  
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?  
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?  
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying  
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
It's been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time  
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?  
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy  
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album, I'm back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Feel like I've been here before huh?  
I still got ten years to go huh?  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
These kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right

To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets

Yeah, I get it  
I get it  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?  
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?  
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?  
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?  
I lost my way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Oh please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else  
I gave your nickname to someone else  
I know you're seein' someone that loves you  
And I don't want you to see no one else  
I don't want you here with no one else  
I don't wanna do this with no one else  
I used to know you back when you was young  
Your brother brought me through, you saw me  
That made me think of you so differently  
I miss the feeling of you missing me  
But you say you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me

Aw, please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Say to you  
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah  
Say to you  
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you  
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?  
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you  
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you  
And they both say that you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]  
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women  
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it  
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision  
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment  
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me  
That mean a lot to me  
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me  
This year for Christmas I just want apologies  
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'  
Syn had a baby and treated me different  
Erika sued me and opened a business  
Wonder if they wish it could've been different  
Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much  
You tip the scale when I weigh my options  
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten  
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'  
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems  
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'  
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet  
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit  
Sell my secrets and get top dollar  
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'  
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?  
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'  
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'  
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

I know

It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine  
Trying to convince myself I've found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from

I believe in people like you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl  
I bet there's a reason for it all  
You say that you're nothing like the last girl  
I just pray that you don't let me down right now  
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours  
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break  
And end up like before  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober  
Telling me how you moving away and starting over  
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit  
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit  
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it  
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it  
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson  
It's feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression  
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different  
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes

Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it

I tell her you're just a friend  
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end  
I'm asking would you be mine  
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45

Tough day I need that one thing only you can do

[Verse 2]  
Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'  
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass  
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life  
Now I'm in the east cause my boys are gettin' right  
Man, I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year  
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear  
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own  
So I started askin' them if they would put me on  
And they did put me on  
Yeah, the did put me on  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line

Oh yeah, I'm on deck when you call me I'll listen  
I listen unless I been mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink its tradition  
Like Zoe mama I go hippy  
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon  
I'm mixin', I am not Esco but it was written  
I knew when they didn't  
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy  
All I just had to do was go and get it

But I can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and  
No one decides who the definition of talent is  
And mrs.? look at what my talent did  
And what yo business is?  
It's been a couple years  
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it  
It's always awkward to... a nigga artist

Because So Far, I'm Nowhere Close To Malik and Deja

I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot  
With The Tires Burnin  
And I'm A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith  
In Any Female that's Askin What I Was Earnin  
I Met This Recent Lady  
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners  
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe  
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby  
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me  
It's Like I'm Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy

With Yoshi Lee And A. Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In

Drake,Too Much,/d/drake/too+much_21068175.html,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?""  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing  
Look, I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit""  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm ""him"" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

More immature than Marques Houston  
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution

I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars

Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin' into one of my niggas

Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing  
Slide on a late night

You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite

Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different  
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!  
Tryna give your ass the world

You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass

Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot  
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it  
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven

I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was  
That's what's important and what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah  
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)  
  
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance  
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for  
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back  
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like  
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like  
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid  
If I don't nothing I'ma ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living

I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed  
I don't really understand it  
I'm not sure I'm comprehending it  
But these girls are having fun with  
Whoevers money they spending screaming  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
I got to be unstoppable  
I got to be unstoppable  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
  
[Verse 2:] Weezy F. Baby  
  
My name is Weezy  
I'm almost perfect  
And I work harder than hardworking bizarre circus  
That's when my bars surface  
Therefore, I act a clown  
Even when I'm laying on my back,  
I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop  
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop  
She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist  
Hoe just text me  
Everybody want some mo dick mo dick  
Old bitch  
Young bitch  
But I'll be like damnnnn  
All I got is one dick

The beats and bass  
Give me one I'll take it  
Make you lose your place,

I break it break it you can't stop me

And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous  
Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""

My frail, virgin mind  
Watched the crimson sunrise  
Imagined what it might find  
Life was filled with wonder  
I felt the warm wind blow  
I must explore the boundaries  
Transcend the depth of winter's snow  
  
Innocence caressing me  
I never felt so young before  
There was so much life in me  
Still I longed to search for more  
  
But those days are gone now  
Changed like a leaf on a tree  
Blown away forever  
Into the cool autumn breeze  
The snow has now fallen  
And my sun's not so bright  
I struggle to hold on  
With the last of my might  
  
In my den of inequity  
Viciousness and subtlety  
Struggle to ease the pain  
Struggle to find the same  
  
Ignorance surrounding me  
I've never been so filled with fear  
All my life's been drained from me  
The end is drawing near...

You can keep a giant alive  
You can ride the red  
Until everybody smiles

Was such an untimely religion  
Maybe your life can explain  
The reason for my indecision

The heart of this monster creation  
He said we both will be heroes  
And I was led into temptation

And the fantasy stays alive.

And leave you falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
Your iconic fixation.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
Build me up!  
Break me down!

A chip on my shoulder  
A lump in my throat  
The size of a boulder  
The chill up my spine  
Can't get any colder  
And you wonder why I can't smile  
  
A knot in my gut  
An ape on my back  
In the heat of the moment  
I'm knocked off the track  
You drop the ball  
I pick up the slack  
And you ask me why my hair's gray  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning  
The pressure keeps on  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
  
I say it's green  
And then you tell me it's red  
Keep your thoughts and ideas  
Locked inside of your head  
We've got someone  
Who can think for you instead  
And he sounds just like the last one  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning  
The pressure keeps on  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul  
  
  
Responsible thinkers  
Throw caution to the wind  
But I find myself  
Speaking from within  
I can't live my life  
Walking on eggshells  
To stay on your good side  
  
Using your words  
Controlling my life  
Can't you see it's my words  
That gives you your life  
So I hurt your feelings  
Well I'm really sorry  
But I don't give a shit, no  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning

The sounds in the hall  
The clock on the wall ticking away  
""Seize the Day""

Life will not always be this way  
Look around  
Hear the sounds  
Cherish your life while you're still around  
We can learn from the past  
But those days are gone  
We can hope for the future  
But there might not be one  
The words stuck in my mind  
alive from what I've heard

Preparing for her fight

Fearing my deepest fright  
She walked in to the night  
She turned for one last look  
She looked me in the eye  
I said, ""I Love You...Good-bye""

Dream Theater,Count Of Tuscany,/d/dream+theater/count+of+tuscany_20790266.html,"Several years ago  
In a foreign town  
Far away from home  
I met the Count of Tuscany  
  
A young eccentric man  
Bred from royal blood  
Took me for a ride  
Across the open countryside  
  
Get into my car  
Let's go for drive  
I love the way I feel uptight  
Just step inside  
  
Maybe you'll recall  
I kind of felt curious  
A character inspired by my brother's life  
  
Winding through the hills  
Seeing far behind  
On and on we drove  
Down narrow streets and dusty roads  
  
And last we came upon  
A picturesque estate  
On sprawling emerald hills  
An ancient world of times gone by  
  
Now let me introduce  
My brother  
A bitter gentleman - historian  
Sucking on his pipe  
Distinguished accent  
Making me uptight - no accident  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right  
  
I  
I don't wanna die  
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Would you like to see  
Our secret holy place?  
I come here late at night  
To pray to him by candle light  
  
Then viewing through the past  
I saw which is believed  
Still dressed in royal clothes  
A saint behind the altar  
  
History recalls  
During times of war  
Legend has been traced  
Stuck inside these castle walls  
  
Soldiers came to hide  
With barrels filled with wine  
Never to escape  
These tombs of old that's where they died  
  
Down the cellar stairs  
I disappear  
Like the angel's share  
The end is near  
  
Come and have a taste  
A rare vintage  
All the finest wines  
Improve with age  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right  
  
I  
I don't wanna die  
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Could this be the end?  
Is this the way I die?  
Sitting here alone  
No one by my side  
  
I don't understand  
I don't feel that I deserve this  
What did I do wrong?  
I just don't understand  
  
Give me one more chance  
Let me please explain  
It's all been circumstance  
I'll tell you once again  
  
It took me for a ride  
Promising a vast adventure  
Next thing that I know  
I'm frightened for my life  
  
Now wait a minute then  
That's not how it is  
You must be confused  
That isn't who I am  
  
Please don't be afraid  
I would never try to hurt you  
This is how we live  
Strange although it seems  
Please try to forgive  
  
The chapel and the Sade  
The soldiers in the wine  
The fables and the tales  
All handed down through time  
  
Of course you're free to go  
Go and tell the world my story  
Tell about my brother  
Tell them about me  
The Count of Tuscany

And won't be coming back

The emptiness inside  
Is growing deeper still

We try to make sense  
Of surviving together  
While living apart  
  
Striving for balance  
We rise to the challenge  
Of staying connected  
In spite of circumstance  
  
All you've forsaken  
And all that you've done  
So that I could live out  
This undying dream  
  
Won't be forgotten  
Or taken for granted  
I'll always remember  
Your endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted

One last time  
Until we fade away

A familiar voice comes shining through

Lured into a doomsday cult.

Self-proclaimed messiah,  
Led his servants  
To their death.  
Eighty murdered  
In the name of God.  
  
Forty sons and daughters,  
Unconsenting plural wives,  
Perversions  
In the name of God.  
  
Underground religion,  
Turning toward  
The mainstream light,  
Blind devotion  
In the name of God.  
  
Justifying violence,  
Citing from the Holy Book,  
Teaching hatred  
In the name of God.

To my suspicions  
And as I'm standing here right now  
I'm finally shown what I have always known  
  
Coincidence I can't belive  
As my childhood dreams alowly come true  
  
Are these her memories  
Awakened through my eyes  
This house has brought back to life  
  
An open door  
I walk on through  
Into his bedroom  
  
Feeling as cold as outside  
The walls disappear  
To some woman who's screaming  
A man pleads forgiveness  
His words I cannot hear

With the sun in our eyes  
Fearing family ties, legalize,  
Compromise

Stage  
A dream-stricken prince of a pauper's  
Descent  
Haunts the eavesdropping silence

To an audience that ticks on the wall

In a steady-set gaze  
A mariner soon from an open cocoon  
Takes a moment to summon his courage  
To stifle his grave apprehension and  
Trembling, approaches the surf  
A father's benediction as his hopeful  
Son departs  
To brave the sea of rage and conquer  
At all costs  
  
Lingers in his memory  
And visions still surviving in a logic-  
Proof shell  
That should have been held sacred, safe  
And hidden well  
Are compromised in usury  
With every rising sun that yields no  
Sight of land  
The hesitation cultivates within the  
Tired man  
And rumors spread of mutiny  
And though the time will come when  
Dream and day unite  
Tonight the only consolation causing  
Him to fight  
In fearless faith in destiny  
  
Even when plans fall to pieces  
I can still find the courage  
With promise I've found in my faith  
  
Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep  
And at odds with our senses we'll climb  
But if faith is the answer, we're already  
Reached it  
And if spirit's a sign  
Then it's only a matter of time

A long lost fortress  
Armed only with liberty  
And the key of my willingness  
  
Fell down on my knees and prayed

Dusty Springfield,24 Hours From Tulsa,/d/dusty+springfield/24+hours+from+tulsa_20822356.html,"Dearest darlin', I had to write to say  
That I won't be home anymore  
For somethin' happened to me as I was driving home  
And I'm not the same anymore  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
And I saw a welcoming light  
And stopped to rest for the night  
  
And that is when I saw him as I pulled in outside  
Of the small motel he was there  
And so I walked up to him, asked where I could get something  
To eat and he showed me where  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
He took me to a cafe  
And he asked me if I would stay, I said okay  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
The jukebox started to play  
And nighttime turned into day  
  
As we were dancing closely all of a sudden  
I lost control, as he held me tight  
And then he kissed me, caressed me  
Told me, he'd die before he would let me out of his arms  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
I hate to do this to you  
But I found somebody new, what can I do  
  
And I can never, never, never go home again

Is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly  
But, darling, can't you see  
There's no one more important to me?  
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?  
'Cause we're alone now, and  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth, withholding nothing  
You came out in front, I was hiding  
Oh, but now I'm so much better  
If the words don't come together  
Just listen to the melody  
'Cause my love's in there hiding  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh, I love you in a place  
Where there's no space or time  
Love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and  
I was singing this song for you

Just who has lost and who has won  
When with them have died so many dreams  
  
They dreamed that endless hate would end  
Unceasing fear, one day, would cease  
They dreamed that foe would turn to friend  
And eternal war would turn to peace

Will join these young and hopeful men?  
In fields they've never seen before  
Far from fields they'll never see again

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to keep love away  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street

Help the needy

To our last sweet embraces  
Over the sea on the island of dreams

High in the sky is a bird on a wing  
Please carry me with you  
Far, far away from the mad rushing crowd  
Please carry me with you  
Again I would wander  
Where memories enfold me  
There on the beautiful island of dreams  
  
Far, far away on the island of dreams

Would always be

Is over  
  
And now you walk away from me  
And there's no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes  
Against the sun that comes to warm the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
It's too late to tell you how I feel  
Our love was real  
And yet, there are so many times  
That people have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
And so I walk away and turn my collar to the wind  
I walk along in silence trying not to think at all  
I put my feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
  
If time were not a moving thing

This love we shared would always be

Something like the shadow of a butterfly

There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky  
The songs you sing  
Will drive away the night

It's the place I've made for you  
From match-boxes and cards and dominoes  
And it won't fall down  
And when your dreaming vanishes

Melts away in darkness

The night is on his hair  
And like a lovesick lenan he  
He hath my heart in thrall  
No life I owe, no liberty  
His love is lord of all  
  
And often when the beetles' horn  
Hath lulled the eve to sleep  
I steal unto his shieling lorn  
And thro' the dooring peep  
There on the cricket's singing stone  
He spears the bird in fire  
And hums in sad, sweet undertone  
The song of his desire

Wandering o'er this world of woe  
And there's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land to which I go  
I'm going home to see my father  
I'm going home, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home  
I know dark clouds will gather round me  
I know my way is rough and steep  
But beautious fields lie just before me  
Where men redeemed their vigil's keep  
I'm going home to see my mother  
I'm going there, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home

But she's singing and she means it  
And she deserves a little silence  
  
Quiet please, there's a woman up there  
And she's been honest through her songs  
Long before your consciousness was raised  
Doesn't that deserve a little praise  
  
So put your hands together and help her along  
All that's left of the singer's  
All that's left of the song  
Stand for the ovation  
And give her one last celebration  
  
Quiet please, there's a person up there  
And she's been singing of the things  
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves  
Give her your respect if nothing else  
  
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
Conductor, turn the final page  
And when it's over we can all go home  
But she lives on -- on the stage alone.

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair,  
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air.  
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light.  
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night.  
There she stood in the doorway,  
I heard the mission bell.  
And I was thinking to myself,  
This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.  
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way.  
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to the Hotel California,  
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place),  
Such a lovely face.  
Plenty of room at the Hotel California,  
Any time of year (any time of year),  
You can find it here.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she's got the Mercedes Benz.  
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends.  
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat,  
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.  
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine.""  
He said ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.""  
And still those voices are calling from far away,  
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to the Hotel California,  
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place),  
Such a lovely face.  
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California,  
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise),  
Bring your alibies.  
  
[Outro]  
Mirrors on the ceiling, and pink champagne on ice,  
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here,  
Of our own device.""  
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast,  
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast.  
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door,  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.  
""Relax"", said the nightman, ""We are programed to receive.""  
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.

And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain  
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008  
This music gave me a lane to ride in,  
But there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight  
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a of a lion  
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars  
You can't gamble with no cards  
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge  
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar  
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly  
But when I'm writing songs,  
I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies  
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind  
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies  
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog  
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong  
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be

Fighting with automatic self destruction

Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on you. K. Streets  
When a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets  
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool  
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk  
Listen, we all get down in the dumps  
But when they hear the melody and base line pump  
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then  
I run loose on my tongue  
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one  
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my  
Cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation.

Sipping on red wine

Ripping out the pages  
How'd I get so faded?  
How'd I get so faded?

Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover  
Thought I'd find her in a bottle  
God, make me another one  
I'll be feeling this tomorrow  
Lord forgive me for the things I've done  
I was never meant to hurt no one  
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the 22nd row  
Who sees you as something as more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I met this girl late last year  
She said don't you worry if I disappear  
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake  
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
But then I jump right in  
A week later returned  
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
But I gave her my time for two or three nights  
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right  
I went away for months until our paths crossed again  
She told me I was never looking for a friend  
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10  
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin  
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am  
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said  
She's singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
For a couple weeks I  
Only want to see her  
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza  
Before a text message was the only way to reach her  
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her  
Singing out Aretha  
All over the track like a feature  
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either  
But me and her we make money the same way  
Four cities, two planes the same day  
Those shows have never been what it's about  
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch  
But we should get on a plane  
Or we'll be missing it now  
Wish I'd have written it down  
The way that things played out  
When she was kissing him  
How? I was confused about  
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 3:]  
[Knock knock] on my hotel door  
I don't even know if she knows what for  
She was crying on my shoulder  
I already told ya  
Trust and respect is what we do this for  
I never intended to be next  
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
And I never saw him as a threat  
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
It's not like we were both on tour  
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor  
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different  
This is not the way you realize what you wanted  
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest  
All this time God knows I'm singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus 2x:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love

On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never in a excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me  
It never made me stronger at all.  
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  
So now I'll maybe leave back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.  
  
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beating  
'Cause you take part of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I've got no plans for the weekend  
So shall we speak then  
Keep it between friends  
No, I know you'll never love me like you used to.  
  
But may be other people like us  
Who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before  
You don't hold me anymore.  
  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake  
You know I can't change as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.  
  
All by myself  
I'm here again  
All by myself  
You know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself

I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again

I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
""Love at first sight"" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that's when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could've happened to make you feel so low?  
Don't let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don't let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.  
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren't drinking then I'd be crying,  
And I think that's something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can't feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That's the thing about love,  
That's the reason why I'll never fall again,  
It hurts when it's supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that's what love is,  
Then I don't ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we've only met each other,  
We'll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.

And I pack another knapsack  
The airport's like a stop light to me  
Sittin' on red, green light go  
Can't see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans, some may call 'em  
And it's on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream  
I lived the life, signed a picture  
'Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block, they judge you on 'em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?  
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
I'm the  
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write  
With a broken pen, there they go again  
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam  
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in  
I'm goin' home, I'm home again

With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy, hell, you say  
I'm just bein' blunt, homie  
Keep the grass

Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah, take one look  
Better yet, take two  
But if I take that break, there's a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots I've been  
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season  
'Cause I am not the reason  
That the image you're used to seein'  
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes, I'm different  
Differently made  
And me screamin' the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
It's the place I stayed  
'Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught, but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne, it was in my name  
Michael  
M.W.A  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin' out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven  
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood line's not a family tree  
It's a needle in my skin for all to see  
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly

My heart is a foreigner,  
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset,  
I'll never keep it bottled up,  
Left to the hands of the coroner,  
Be a true heart not a follower,  
We're not done yet now,  
I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we can ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
Now keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down.  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
My eyes are a river filler,  
This drink is a liver killer,  
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
  
And your mind is my new best friend,  
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again,  
Now I see it in your movements tonight,

Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,/e/ed+sheeran/i+see+fire_21071421.html,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain dewlow  
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls  
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke  
Keep watching over Durin's son  
  
If this is to end in fire  
Then we should all burn together  
Watch the flames climb high into the night  
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
And if we should die tonight  
Then we should all die together  
Raise a glass of wine for the last time  
Calling out father, oh  
Prepare as we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn over  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see fire  
Inside the mountain  
I see fire  
Burning the trees  
And I see fire  
Hollowing souls  
I see fire  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
Oh, should my people fall in  
Surely I'll do the same  
Confined in mountain halls  
We got too close to the flame  
Calling out father  
Hold fast and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
And if the babies are burning  
I will get myself a fork  
For if the dark returns then  
My brothers will come for dinner  
And as the sky is falling down  
It crashed into this party town  
And with that shadow upon the ground  
I hear my people screaming out  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
  
I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning) (fire)  
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)

But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
And put your faith in my stomach

Late last night  
Drinking to suppress devotion  
With fingers intertwined  
I can't shake this feeling now  
We're going through the motions  
Hoping you'd stop  
  
And oh I've only caused you pain  
You know but all of my words will always below  
Of all the love you spoke  
When you're on my road walking me home  
Home, home, home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love

Ed Sheeran,London Bridge,/e/ed+sheeran/london+bridge_21005483.html,"There wasn't much left  
Except for the last twenty sack  
And the last twenty of my last check  
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step  
Woke up and took it in with a half breath  
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick  
I lit my cigarette  
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind  
Then came the dead  
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest  
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by  
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye  
Baby in her arms  
She took a cab home  
She told me I was only good for a sad song  
A crooked smile I gave  
Nonchalant about it  
Maybe she'll come back  
This time I doubt it  
Act like I care, but I really don't  
Wanted to change  
But somehow I knew I really won't  
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle  
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow  
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal  
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill  
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand  
God's not going to land another saving hand  
If the time came like it has time again  
Then I would watch the clock and be late again  
One gun and a Harley in the driveway  
One way out, dirt road, pathway  
Put another dead butt in the ash tray  
I stand up still drunk, half baked  
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring  
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring  
Paid him no attention  
In fact I barely seen him  
Until he walked away  
And he started singing  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I didn't see it coming  
I didn't see the wall  
And I went from running, to a slow crawl  
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry  
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie  
I speak no evil, but hear no angels  
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers  
Take the bible from the hotel drawer  
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door  
Knock knock  
I'm on the salt road non stop  
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot  
And the gust of a dry summer  
Dirty water in the tap  
I think I found my number in the sand  
Right next to an empty can  
Old number seven, Jack is back again  
And the voice goes round and round  
And I would take the bridge  
But I can't forget the sound  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down

That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all

Ed Sheeran,Photograph,/e/ed+sheeran/photograph_21058341.html,"[Verse 1]  
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes.  
But it's the only thing that I know.  
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,  
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts are never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul,  
And it's the only thing that I know, know.  
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of 'ya,  
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts were never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone,  
And if you hurt me,  
That's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home.  
  
[Bridge]  
You can fit me  
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen.  
Next to your heartbeat where I should be.  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
And if you hurt me  
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
  
[Outro]  
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me  
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street,  
Hearing you whisper through the phone,  
Wait for me to come home.

Disappearing all night

I know what I wanna do  
I wanna runaway runaway with you  
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go  
How long are you leaving?  
Well dad just don't expect me back  
This evening  
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this  
It's been a long day almost out of the roadway  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in this home  
There's nothing to say cuz he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own  
  
I've never seen my dad cry  
Cold as stone, in the kitchen light  
I tell you it's about time  
But I was raised to keep quiet  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move  
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go  
  
How long are you leaving?

Turned to the back  
Cause I packed my clothes up  
My dad wasn't in without that plan to attack and turns his shoulder  
I don't wanna live this way  
Gonna take my things and go  
If things change in a matter of days  
Could be persuaded to hold up  
And mama was the same  
None of us are saints  
To get the god knows that  
I don't wanna runaway  
And one of these days I might just show that  
Put my home in a suitcase  
tie both shoelaces, and hope that  
Things change, but for now  
I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder  
  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in home  
There's nothing to say and he knows

We wish they would disappear  
So maybe we could get down now  
And I don't wanna know

To hold your body close  
Take another step into the no-man's land  
For the longest time lady

Won't you let me know

I saw flames from the side of the stage  
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days  
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know  
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke  
Let it go until I wrote a change  
Singing we found love in a local rage no  
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say  
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray  
I told them my name and said it's nice to meet ya  
And then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila

Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep  
If anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home  
But I'm drunk and gonna live it now not?

Led to another now she's kissing my mouth

Found you hiding here so hoped you taked my hand  
  
Before the beats kicks in again

Fulfills my needs and gives me company

seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,  
Never been known by my government name, my foster home is where I've been
placed away from the pain,  
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with
nothing on me but power and glory,  
And surely you'll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was
made to disappear for me,  
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never
meant to I won't hold it against you,  
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in
my forearms,  
Forget me not never let me stop you'll just sit and watch it's your job to be
patient so you'll let me off,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side, see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,  
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away,  
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I
guess the teacher finds it hard to,  
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry
a head fuck,  
Constantly told I won't pass my gcse's,  
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese,  
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,  
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,  
Lately classmates think I'm crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey,  
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it without new clothes or
shower it hard to do,  
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes but they'll get
taken off me when I get back to the group home,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,

Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light
on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night  
I don't drink like everybody else  
End up forgetting things about myself  
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked  
My head's still with you but my hearts just not  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that  
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views  
Everything's great but everything's short  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now I'm in position to be another stalker  
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward  
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous  
On the surface  
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over

And maybe I can let myself down oh  
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground  
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low  
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms  
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong  
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one  
But I know that god made another one of me  
To love you better than I ever will  
  
'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I

Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?  
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones  
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones  
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum  
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots  
  
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love  
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love

Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up  
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan  
No one here to save the day now you're all alone  
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth  
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone

I know your proud staring at your grandson  
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I  
like  
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write  
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine  
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die  
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'  
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry  
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must  
now I gotta fly  
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,  
I don't stop at night.  
  
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again  
I never close my eyes,  
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you  
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you

Welcome home, where you been all

down like flies,  
I've seen kings, rolling in the mire,  
I've seen God, point the finger of  
doom to our foes.  
I have fought in the holiest wars,  
I have smashed, some of the holiest jaws  
I've been jailed, been impaled, and  
been dragged through the world.  
One thing, I have learned through  
these years,  
Is that no man, should be stricken  
with fear  
It should be that he walks with no  
care in the world.  
So my friends, who are gathered here  
today,  
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say,  
That no man, shall cause me to take  
up arms again.

I really cared, gave her a diamond ring  
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me  
Well I never saw her face since then  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
She must be somewhere on the open road  
She always said she was a lonely one  
She gets you down with her tales of woe  
She took me for everything  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things we'd done  
But where could she run- she ran away  
There's just no answer to give  
  
I keep wonderin' about her, day and night  
She probably thinks I was a fool- she's right  
She don't know it  
But I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman  
I'm gonna search everywhere

Tired of waiting for it all to hit the ground

What was right and what was wrong  
You pulled the wool over the eyes of everyone  
Maybe I was weak when I should've been strong  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took me by surprise and like a shot in the dark, shot in the dark  
You showed yourself in your truest light, truest light  
You saved yourself by saving nobody else  
You must have cringed when you heard them tell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took the wrong turn at the city of dreams, city of dreams  
You ended up back where you came from it seems, came from it seems  
Back there to where there's nothing else to do  
Back there where you can sit and think of only you

The secrets never end  
And now they call,  
They sing, they play, they dance  
For you, from out of the blue,  
What can you do?  
  
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly  
They call to me across the air  
The messages across the atmosphere  
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere  
  
Where words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky  
Then I'll be there, I'll be there  
When messages will call to you their secrets all around  
Without a sound, they're all around  
  
Those secret messages that spill into the air from far away

A flowing river of illusion running with confusion  
Never gone - it goes on and on

And I left you so long on this avenue  
And here I stand in the strangest land  
Not knowing what to say or do  
As I gaze around at these strangers in town  
I guess the only stranger is me  
And I wonder, yes I wonder  
Is this the way life's meant to be  
  
Although it's only a day since I was taken away  
And left standing here looking in wonder  
The ground at my feet, maybe it's just the old street  
But everything that I know lies under  
And when I see what they've done to this place that  
was home  
Shame is all that I feel  
And I wonder, yes I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be  
  
Too late, too late to cry  
The people say  
Too late for you, too late for me  
You've come so far, now you know everything  
My friend  
Just look and see the wonders of our world  
  
As I wander around this wreck of a town  
Where people never speak aloud  
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers  
I wish I was back in 1981  
Just to see your face instead of this place  
Now I know what you mean to me  
And I wonder, yes, I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be.

The one they told you when life was slipping away  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You got a brand new lady  
Just like the one you left down in some other place  
Reading all the letters  
Saw your face coming through on the ouija board  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You heard the words of aaron  
He spoke the truth in these things both great and small  
  
You can throw away the ashes  
You sweep them over the world on your own accord  
Did you know the real answer?  
Youd see the kind of mistakes that you can't afford

Out of town were the people i knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do, what to do, what to do  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
  
But as i walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known  
  
A foggy day, in London town  
Had me low, had me down  
I viewed the morning, with much alarm  
British museum, had lost its charm  
  
How long i wondered,  
Could this thing last  
But the age of miracles, hadn't past  
For suddenly, i saw you there  
And through foggy London town,  
The sun was shining everywhere

Or if it's dark or fair  
Somehow, that's just the way it is  
And I don't really care  
  
I go to this or that place  
I seem alive and well  
My head is just a hat place  
My breast an empty shell  
And I've a faded dream to sell  
  
All alone, all at sea  
Why does nobody care for me?  
When there's no love to hold my love  
Why is my heart so frail?  
Like a ship without a sail.  
  
Out on the ocean,  
Sailors can use a chart  
I'm on the ocean  
Guided by just a lonely heart  
  
Still alone, still at sea  
Still there's no one to care for me  
When there's no hand to hold my hand  
Life is a loveless tale  
For a ship without a sail

Love that piano sound in Duke's place

Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's place  
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's place  
You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat  
You look around and yell waiter  
  
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up  
You're jetting along with your girlie  
It's after three o'clock, but, baby, it's still early  
If you've never been to Duke's place  
Take your tootsies into Duke's place  
Life is in a spin in Duke's place

Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead. She's gone where the goblins go,  
Belowhoo - below. Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out.

undenially unreliably

only really  
dead, she's really most sincerely dead. And this is a day of independance, for
all the munchinks  
And there decendants. Symphany yes lets the joyous news be spread the wicked
old witch at last  
is dead.  
Ding Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old Witch? The Wicked Witch!  
Ding Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead.  
Wake up - sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed.  
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead. She's gone where the goblins go,  
Belowhoo - below. Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out.  
Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low.  
Let them know  
The Wicked Witch is dead!

Ella Fitzgerald,Do I Love You?,/e/ella+fitzgerald/do+i+love+you_20045712.html,"Do I love you do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I, if you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day, what would life be?  
  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you forever?  
Isn't heaven forevermore?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh my dear it's so easy to see  
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do  
Just as you love me.  
  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?

Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do

Ella Fitzgerald,Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me,/e/ella+fitzgerald/do+nothin+till+you+hear+from+me_20045713.html,"Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
While we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will!

Ella Fitzgerald,Don Cha Go Way Mad,/e/ella+fitzgerald/don+cha+go+way+mad_20816488.html,"I must confess what you say is true  
I had a rendezvous with somebody new  
That's the only one I ever had  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Cheatin' shows and it never goes  
You got a reason to be mad I suppose  
But she only was a passin' fad  
Baby, don't you be mad  
  
Her kind's a dime a dozen  
And that's not the kind I want  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would wander into that restaurant?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Now, her kind's a dime a dozen  
I should've passed her by  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would come along and give us the eye?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Understand that you're quite upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad  
Now, don'cha go away mad
