Yes,Finally,/y/yes/finally_20148421.html,"Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test  
Finally  
  
Make no mistake to the mainstream  
Music be the master planner  
Just like the books you read  
You'll hear it on your radio scanner  
  
It's not so much what you know  
Or who you know that's coming  
Its what you do regardless  
Its what you do... eventually  
  
Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test  
Finally  
  
I've seen them running, down and out  
Never mind the good intentions  
A dreamer with a reason to live  
Is as clear as his next invention  
  
You take a second look to find  
A second chance at giving  
The voices say do not despair  
There's a real good reason you're living  
  
I could feel the earth moving  
I could see sky falling  
We can chase the storm  
We can sing the rain  
Walk the final distance  
Live this life again  
  
Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test telling me to let go  
  
I can feel the earth moving (i can sing the rain)  
I can feel the rain coming (live this life again)  
I can feel the storm  
I can sing the rain  
I can free my heart  
Live this life again  
You can choose to stand  
You can choose to fall  
You can see the rain  
You can have it all  
  
I can feel the rain coming  
I can feel the earth moving  
I can feel the love coming  
  
I can feel the earth moving  
I can feel the rain coming  
I can feel the love coming  
I can feel the earth moving

Yes,Friend Of A Friend,/y/yes/friend+of+a+friend_20842221.html,"You found folks treat you right  
As long as you let them know  
You've been ready to defend their right

But if it chokes you let it go  
If it doesn't sound true to you  
It's no business of yours  
  
You can count friends on your fingers  
Count 'em on your toes  
If you leave you are a friend of all  
Those friendships heaven knows  
  
But there comes a time when your testimony  
Will crumble like a rose

It's over

True friends will never question you  
You  
  
And it's all there  
In the stories  
We're about to read of a long time ago  
And it's really always been there  
To let you know  
  
There are times way back in history  
Where valor overcame  
The almighty tyrants of the past  
Forgotten all but name  
As the sons of righteous leaders  
Bent on crushing nations  
Thus believe the sprirt just  
  
And it's all there  
Frienships can never be forgotten  
In the end years  
You've got to hold on to what you've got  
What you've got

We're about to read of a long time ago  
In the modern day around  
You let it show  
  
You can see love deep in children's eyes  
Feel 'em in the wind  
You can reach the blessings of the  
Innocence on which we meet  
You can guide love in the atomosphere  
Arising from the source  
You know the citizen of chance is  
Another citizen of choice  
  
If you're mortal, be destroyed  
Then immortal be the course

Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy),  
My bed will be boomin' for you.

I can hear the music playin', then I hear ya voice sayin',  
""Ohh daddy now jus give it to me right there."" ""Ohh baby, take a handful of my

'Cause you like it rough (rough) can't get enough (nough).  
'Cause I'm the type of nigga thats gon fill you up, like a cup.  
And make this love thing overflow,  
I wont stop until ya body's tellin' me so.  
Sheets gettin' sticky from the strawberries and whipped cream,  
If these walls could talk they would say this is one hell of a scene.  
Now you movin' ya body jus like a gymnast,  
From the bed to the dresser, all type a' crazy shit.  
Case is tellin' me stories, body's hot and so horny,  
Hittin' it from the rear, wanna whisper somethin' in yo ear.  
""I'm gonna love you all night I promise.""

Bedroom boom, (like boom boom boom!)  
My bed will be boomin' for you, (my bed will be shakin' til' the screws come
loose, while I'm off in t)  
  
Boom goes the bedroom, behind closed doors, and the bedroom depends on how far
things go.  
You move slow or move fast when you off in that ass,  
But you hittin' that mothafucker like every time yo last.  
Spread yo legs like a bald eagle, work that back, move like a snake when you
do dat dat.  
Now be quiet, you dont want them to hear us outside.  
Let me get on bottom while you ride.  
  
You hotter than an album store, (yea) temptation got ya outta control, (mmm

Out in the cold, you screamin' you cant take it no more.  
Beat the pussy so bad we done fell on the flo.

All this love is waitin for you like I'm El Debarge.  
See my dick stay hard. (oh) and its gon stay cocked.  
(Yes) if a bitch fuck wit me she  
Gettin her cherry popped.

Bedroom boom, (what goes on in this room, so what baby..)

Lives a race of forgotten man  
With a will never seen before  
Do we dare to unlock the door  
  
In his world there's so much to fear  
And all the pain that he's made to bare  
One desire, that's his will to live  
  
Not destroy, but to give  
  
He's been lost for so many years  
By his choice, he has disappeared  
From a world that is closing in  
As the end of this race begins  
  
All he wants is to be left free  
No other land does he want to see  
In his heart he knows it won't be long  
He won't give up, he must stay strong  
  
As he tries to hide, from the madness  
There's no hope in hell, for tomorrow won't live on  
  
What is gone, may never have been  
Another world, now he's fallen in  
All his dreams, how they've disappeared  
Now he lives, all he feared  
  
He only wanted to be left free  
This other land that he's forced to see  
In his mind, his will always be  
A place that he'll never leave  
  
As he tries to hide, from the madness  
There's no hope in hell, it's gone  
Tomorrow won't live on ...

Disturbing peace inside my home  
Tryna tell my biz and shit so he can get inside the throne

Ever since the third grade still got the same waves

Mr. Tell It tell the truth, is you jealous or you jes?  
Overprotected don't fuck around and get no injection  
Not bout the bitch but bout the principle  
That you want to see me living life miserable  
They say bullets ain't got no name money ain't got no rules  
And a bitch gone do what she want to  
My street literature spit at her so quick and smooth  
She give a fuck about the hustling doubts that you went through  
So get yourself together dawg and tune in tonight  
She want to fuck with a thug Mr. Tell It you too nice  
All you want to do is lick her pussy and hit her bare  
She want to fuck with a nigga that don't really care  
Yo gotti hit the bitch and I'll never call her again  
Same room same hotel next week with her friend  
So Mr. Tell It I hope you linen (listen)  
Stay the fuck up out my business

I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now  
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house  
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it  
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet  
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it  
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it  
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola  
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck  
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda  
I remember this shit like it was yesterday  
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face  
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk  
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt  
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know  
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go  
[Chorus repeat- X2]  
I'm on the motherfucking grind  
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind  
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind  
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine  
[Yo Gotti]  
What am I to do now, where am I to go?  
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?  
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared  
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head  
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper  
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles  
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper  
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper  
72 hours had 28 elither  
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether  
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing  
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing  
[Chorus]  
[Yo Gotti]  
One week later had 4 and a split  
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit  
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems  
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya  
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home  
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own  
Mama let me back in, mama real strict  
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit  
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true  
So what the fuck a nigga gone do  
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit  
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

And you know, they say it's a man's job to respect a woman  
For me personal I feel like a woman supposed to give a man something for a man
to respect  
I ain't wrong for thinking that as I am wrong for thinking this!  
  
On me to buy you a bag, but is you worthy?  
Nah, I ain't perfect!  
And I just followed you on Instagram  
Are you really into women and that you get around?  
Now I ain't judging, I'm just asking if that's fair to say  
But either way, it's my opinion, you know give or take!  
I told this model chick,  
The girls look up to you and the things you do  
Every nigga you work with, you're screwing,  
So you know she will love you, you know she don't do it, she like  
You don't know me, you don't pay my bills  
You don't know my struggle,  
Like this she real, but it is what it is  
But I know you lying, I know what's real  
I know your worth, I know that purse

Do you wanna get out of this?  
Would you feel disrespected  
If I said you fat as shit?  
Wow, if I called you my bitch  
When I'm with my partners eating?  
As a badge of honor or just be like no Wale  
Don't call me out at my momma's given.  
Name sacred, she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs  
And I leave her inner feelings, cause I never leave her dry!  
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised  
She know these Jones on my John, but I still give her time.  
I try follow her, everybody want her  
Worried about none if she gonna work that body!  
And I unfollow her, though my eyes still on her'  
I'm still caught up, call her thirst trap shawty  
  
I will give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do to you!

Oh, what you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn, that you earn!  
  
She lives for the night life, and that's alright  
But she wants to be treated like somebody's wife.  
But you can't be table hopping in a club trying to drink free  
Girl, come up to my table trying to stand next to me!  
Oh no, oh no, oh no

See I'm a different type of nigga, I'm on that different shit  
Every day I wake up, I want a different bitch  
I don't want the whip plain, I want the kit on it  
Talking rims so big, they can feed on it  
I just bought a different watch, and another chain  
Fuck around and call my bitch another name  
Got confession to make, you hoes look the same  
And I'm so full of that liquor, it oughta be a shame  
Say the rap game changed, alot of niggas stressin'  
But between me and you, nigga that's a blessin'  
fake niggas come up, real niggas suffer  
Record labels fuckin' niggas, that's why I don't trust 'em  
This my testimony (my testimony), I made it true to see  
Hope the Lord forgive a nigga, streets is my religion  
Now I can get a amen, or can you bless a nigga with a thousand eight grams  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I'm in my hood, slangin' that white  
Shirt on right, no ? on sight  
Hundred I shoot, hundred I hit,  
Five hundred ? nigga this my life  
Yo Gotti don't shit round me but my money get high  
If it's crap in the room, and it ain't a real goon  
Then you know soon that it ain't my guy  
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen five  
Anything else, way too high  
Gucci, Louis that's all I buy  
way to high, need to come down  
Need a...  
Don't know me, don't know you  
...my hood, so don't come around.  
I'mma tell you like a nigger told me  
..might be OG  
That being said, that being told  
That's the first nigger in front of me,a whole key  
..put it in my hand, cause he know I wanna plan  
..he had to shoot me  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
My testimony, my testimony, my testimony!  
  
Yeah, I hear... inside the kitchen saying  
..why took 'em bitches  
..full of money.. but I kept the chopper  
..cha cha cha ain't no stopping me!  
acting crazy, yes I am, nobody need to pray for me

Yo Gotti,Wanna Play,/y/yo+gotti/wanna+play_20676425.html,"Tuesday night, I was laid up in the bed  
Tired as hell, I'm hearing voices in my head  
Heard some knocks, grabbed my tone, ran to the doe (door)  
Screamed, ""Who is it?"", but i ain't hear that shit no mo'  
Cocked my nine  
I went to peekin' out the blinds  
Thought it was fine  
But at a unexpected time  
The doe (door) flew in, I got a two-story home  
Seen 'em comin' wit they face masks on  
Bust the choppers, down the stairs, they hit the cut  
Two of them got away, but the other two got stuck  
Hit 'em again  
One in the neck, one in the chin  
Then called the Law and said I did they ass in  
Hook:  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
OK, you want to play  
You say you know where I stay?  
Well, come today  
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it  
You bitch you  
Say whodie, you won't believe what happened to me  
A nigga all in my spot, and he askin' for me  
See I wouldn't at the spot, but my broad was there  
When she hit me on the phone, it's niggas in there  
They knocked me off for a bird and my platinum chain  
Them niggas from round there, they just doin' they thang  
I respect the game  
But they got to respect it, I ain't no hoe ass nigga  
I'm gone take car my business  
Next day, broad-daylight, rode the track  
The first nigga looked suspicious had to get in the back  
(Talking)  
Bitch, we ain't straight no mo'  
Hoe we used to have fun, we don't play no mo'  
Them niggas that you run wit, they kicked in my doe  
So I'm gone shoot you in yo face if you don't cough up that dope, bitch  
Hook  
This situation is a cold thang  
I got to explain  
Cause nigga this a cold game  
I was keeping my pounds at a spot in Raleigh  
But I was moving them thangs, like they was hot tamales  
Well, hot tamales, I played the cards I was dealt  
Because I knew befo' long that they'll hang they self  
I ain't no fool  
Nigga that's why I play it cool  
I know the shit you will and won't try to do  
But what you came in wit, that's what you left wit (AHH HAA)  
Because I'm three steps ahead, it's like you brainless  
I been fuckin' wit money, I been having birds  
I disassociated my self from bad nerves  
Cause once you under pressure, you'll bust trick  
And you the type of nigga that I can't trust bitch  
And the nigga that went, you just a send-out  
I tried to kill yo hoe ass, but you went out, the window, bitch

I remember like yesterday, phone ringing up off the hook  
Pandemonium in the north, what happened to juk?  
Shit, I don't know, guess the same old bullshit  
Fed's said, DP got caught with half a brick  
That damn near stopped my heart  
'Cause me and knowing my brother I'm thinking this shit hard  
But luckily it was soft and fortunately he was straight  
We're findin' to take it to trial, but went on sign for eight

Lil' sister we're gon' be aight, he gon' be okay  
Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
His sister taking it bad, mama trying to be strong  
Couple calendar years, I never shedded a tear  
Wrote him a couple letters to tell him I'm doin' better  
Told him, I took his Chevy and put the shit back together  
Told him, I'm gettin' money, I counted a hundred G's  
Told me to slow it down, play the shit low key  
Told me to make it happen, focus more on rappin'  
'Cause fuckin' round in these streets that anything can happen  
Told me I had heart, plus he knew I was smart  
The only thing that'd break his heart is  
If I fuck around and catch a charge  
Told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer  
And do what I had to do to overcome the struggles

Got me a brick and started moving that weight  
Finally made parol, they think he gon' change his life  
I axed him what he gon' do, he said he's gon' walk light  
It wasn't a year later, he smokin' behind tint  
Half an ounce of the reddy rock, man they got his ass again  
Judge gave him a bond, now he out on the run  
With that fuck the world attitude, still totin' a gun  
Still havin' his fun, we clubbin' it on the weekend  
Thought I had conversations 'bout going to turn himself in  
Wanted to raise his son, gon' get the shit behind him  
Plus he knew it's only so long before they find him  
Lawyer was talking good, say he gon' get three  
When the prosecutor quit yellin' they gave my brother eleven  
My mama damn near fainter, my brother didn't want to accept it  
The hardest part for me, I couldn't do nothing to help it  
Rap shit paid off, now we all on TV  
My brother say, he good, he finally feel free  
Mama, we're gon' be aight  
He gon' be okay

Rivers that ran through everyday  
Now I must've been mad or I never knew what I had  
I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
And it makes the world go round  
Love and only love it can't be denied  
No matter what you think about it  
You won't be able to live without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So if you find someone  
Who gives you all of their love  
Take it to your heart  
Don't let it stray  
Because one thing is for certain  
You'll surely be hurting  
If you thow it all away  
Just don't throw it all away

Fell asleep at last

Going 65  
Slid along an icy stretch, made it back alive

Climbing up the escalator as it takes you down

Burning through the air  
It's still raining hard, you said  
Have you any clue?

Someday I'll be remembered for the phone calls I never made  
  
Letters I never mailed  
And stories I never finished telling anyone

He took a shoot and people smiled  
I tried the same and people frowned

One day let's be a pair of trees  
Nobody'll know that the trees had such a history  
Anyway, wed never be this lonely

A warm smile I meant to leave  
And a true song I meant to finish writing all my life

Just throw your hands up  
And then wave them left to right  
And now do your dance child  
Cause its alright already  
Always surrounded by negativity  
This might be where I live  
But it ain't gonna change me  
Gotta work on my mind  
And keep my actions pure  
And when I stumble, I know who has the cure  
So any time your feeling down  
Just lift your voice in praise  
It'll pick you right up  
And you can come to Him don't be afraid  
Anytime , day or night He can give you what you need  
And if you pray your prayer in faith  
And in your heart believe that  
  
When life's problems get you down  
Can't find no peace nowhere around  
Trust in the spirit you can't see  
Its bout to bring you your relief  
Go ahead and cry now , Its alright  
Cause now you're cryin tears of joy  
This life ain't hurting you no more  
Cause you know its already alright  
  
Its already alright,Its already alright  
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down  
Just bow and pray And then give it all up  
And know everything's gonna be okay

I must tell everyone of the Savior I know  
And the things He has done  
He's the truth and the life  
And there's no other way to the Father, but by Him  
Long ago when He knew you'd be out on a limb  
He gave His life for you, can't you live yours for Him?  
He's the Almighty rock and you won't have a firm foundation  
Unless you're built on Him  
You can't live without Him  
You can't move without Him  
You can't breathe without Him  
You can't think about doing one thing without Him  
You can't do without Him  
'Cause there's no you without Him  
Because He's the only way

Come on mamma, let it fade away  
For good this time and gone we'll stay  
All the scenes are gonna pass on by

He took a break from running but he wasn't done yet  
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds  
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife  
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life  
  
He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasn't thinking clear  
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer  
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down  
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town  
  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
And even if he makes it, there's nothing he can do  
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news  
  
A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past  
About all the women he had known and living life too fast  
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head  
Should have known the sheriff wouldn't rest till he was dead  
  
The town line's far away and  
He's six feet in the grave  
He's lying there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife

Is it ever gonna be just you and me?  
  
Four seventy to Circular Quay.  
A present in your pocket for the TAB  
  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me?  
  
Would you settle for a mobile home  
A good record store and a public phone  
  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together.

The things I promised not to do with you today

Just like they said it would be.  
You ain't gonna fall on my floor

Man I ain't even ask for this shit...  
there's no way I can hide it  
You see the pain in my eyes  
I ain't thinkin bout college  
Too busy tryin to stay alive  
They done cut the water off  
And I ain't trying to the lights go  
Even little shit like 5 dollars I'ma fight for  
My sisters only 12 and she's pregnant wit a baby  
My brothers goin' ta jail and my momma's going crazy  
I'm all by myself, muthafuck my ol' lady  
???'Cause soon tha money left, she was fucking niggas daily???  
We already in hell, Lord, please will you save me  
I'm riding with a 12 gauge I know these niggas hate me  
I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the streets  
I'm swirving in excursions I know you heard of me  
I got em mad at me I hit the block top drop that nigga bad ain't he  
We sell rocks plus glocks and keep our rags hanging  
Thug niggas shooting at cops  
Look we ain't playing, anywhere, setting up shop  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody that who can come and explain that  
I know  
You got the ak bitches in the hood  
These snitches in the hood  
My suggestion to you nigga start getting it while its good  
If you crawl for your ball learn the game know the things that will get you
knocked off  
'Cause niggas out here ain't playin  
???Being real done popped off???  
???Two pills in this home got me way in new york???  
Bout to run up in your home and I'm way up your floor  
My money and I'm gone, if he paid me on time, then we wouldn't have to shoot
em  
But they got a place for him like they got a place for me  
Maybe we'll meet again, we'll just have to wait and see  
Thug niggas, I love killin, so cock it back and bust  
Remember me, I used to smoke weed on the school bus  
Nigga wha? nigga who? nigga wotcha won do?  
I'm young buck, now move? and let me come through  
Is it true before you die do you really see it coming Do the hardest nigga
crying start running?  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that  
I know  
Politicians is bullshitting  
And really bill clinton is the closest we gettin to ever havin a black
president  
Still I feel heaven sent and try to walk with my head up  
'Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of  
Nobody prepared us for this  
All they said was ""make sure you watch the news at six""  
And we feeding all these other countries  
What about that old man eating out of the fuckin dumpster?  
Oh you don't know him but everything that goes up must come down  
One look, and all the projects that they got go down  
I'm rydin' with god  
???Me and my squad nigga, you get beat???  
Now we ballin but remember how it used to be  
So regardless, don't let nothing come between our family our money our dreams  
And even when it seems like its all over from Tennessee to the Magnolia  
We gonna ball till we faulter  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still let a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that

Your going back to jail that's what my conscious keep on telling me  
I really ain't buying all this bullshit they selling me  
When the government throwing more curves than the letter C  
I said the letter C I guess that's for correctional  
They try to box me in, sit me still like a vegetable  
  
[Chorus]  
God damn another trap I think bush trying to punish us  
Sending little messages out to each and every one of us  
Real g shit well that's really unheard of  
When you get more time for selling dope than murder  
In this crazy world  
This world keeps spinning my rims still spinning  
Even though the money slow we still spinning  
In this crazy world  
Let this world keep turning yeah my blunts still burning  
Same thing different day still burning  
In this crazy world and this dopes still selling  
And these niggas still telling  
When you make it through the day its no talent  
In this crazy world (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
In this crazy world  
  
When I was fourteen I turned nothing to a quarter meal  
Probably why I never give a fuck about a record deal  
And I ain't never tried the shit imagine how that white feel  
But that don't even matter though trying to pay the light bill,  
Light bill, phone bill plus my granted nerve bills  
Feel like I should be taking off imagine how my nerves feel  
I want a new Bentley my aunty need a kidney  
And if I let her pass her children never will forgive me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't a x box so why you niggas trying to play with me  
I really be the streets so what you niggas got to say to me  
Cant be much cant be much (why?) cause I ain't listening  
I just left the hood and ill be damned if they ain't filling them want to see
me fall off guess that just the way it be  
Old school triple beam them usually that the way it be  
And plus I got a driver that get them things from a to b  
Soon as you get your money right they hit you with conspiracy

And I ain't leaving shit in my cup, that's such a waste  
You know I'm sipping on that straight like that ""oh, what a a taste!""  
Tip the valet a hundred, I love to stunt  
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front  
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her  
But you can just imagine the shit I'm 'bout to show her  
Snow way, them streets too cold, them bitches polar  
Expectations out of this world, I'm thinking solar  
That's why I do it for that Kalamazoo  
And then NOLA, that's what happens  
When you learn to mix it with that soda

I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up  
Motivating factors that I'm liver than most  
I boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing  
Put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame  
Maintain my fame, get you new pictures  
Just to put in your frame  
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game  
Foot in the cane, walking just like I'm an Indian chief  
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath  
You may think it's a leaf!  
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth  
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!  
It's OK, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip  
With a fit on Crip, don't trip

The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop  
But now I'm fresh out and you know it don't, stop  
So please man, somebody call the weed man  
I'd call mine, but he's been low on herb even  
I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had  
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag  
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love  
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs  
If it's weed, then I'm with it  
You got a paper? Then twist it. You got a bowl? Fill it.  
Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut  
But shit for what? Cause ain't no green on the scene

Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head  
Cause he was workin for the feds  
And the last informant, informed us  
They had it out for us  
For a bird that he got popped for  
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)

Them blunts burn slow but that paper come fast

I'm first place you fuck niggas so last  
In I'm back to the future fuck niggas so past

Straight like that, yea I fuck with her the long way  
Been bragging to my partners, I been talking 'bout her all day  
Pull up in that Super-coupe, you know them diamonds glistening  
Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then  
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet  
Now that I got her to myself man, you know I'm tryna get that girl wet  
Keep it one thousand with you, I really think I'm diggin' her  
Can't hear nothing but the money so she might just think I'm big enough

Meet her at my low-key apartment, never at the house  
Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth  
Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, off the chain  
Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain?  
Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills  
Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil  
Even when she going for the low, says she's not a ho

I got my mind on my money, money on my mind  
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)  
I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind  
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)  
I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind  
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)  
[Verse 1 - Sean Paul]  
I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind  
The thing I got I sell it, to get it all the time  
A nickle or a dime, a half or a pound  
Long as my bitch ridin', I'll put a nigga down  
I'm a playa from the jump, a hustler from the start  
Something in your chest, then open up your heart  
I'm bouta bet it,like Memphis 10, they get it get it  
Gotta have it have it, take it all, man if they let me  
Ima run it, put somethin' on it, instead of bet it  
It's that money, don't make no money, buddy I'm ready  
Can I get it? It's win or lose, you know the rules  
We rollin', we didn't hit it, now pay your dues  
[J-Bo]  
Now when it comes to gettin' that cash flow  
I'm all about that paper, no credit, just straight dough  
And for all who don't know, there's money out to be made  
So get it while you can, and still it's just a phase  
In the eyes of a hustler nigga, you'd be amazed  
That time waits for no one, so God, I pray  
Try hard not to fall through life stuck unemployed  
So instead I keep on livin' what's given within my void  
Put a end after hours scrapin' up all my change  
From quarters to dimes, as you see, this ain't no game  
So pick up on your pimpin', get on it and never slip  
'cause all on my mind is my money fully gripped (fully gripped)  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2 - Sean Paul]  
Just call me, the money maker, bread taker  
Nigga Breaker, the pocket raper, money scraper  
May do me a favor, stay the fuck up out my way-a  
The rock that I can take it buddy to collect my paper  
That might save ya, think of no anger, no player hater  
No bumpin' heads, when it come to gettin' this paper  
I'm a player, runnin' wit the, hand that was dealt  
Flippin' my work, ridin' the left, fully equipped  
ain't fuckin' wit hoes, unless talkin 'bout bread  
Duckin' these streets, givin' these strangers some head  
Bringin' it back, makin' sho', my pockets swole  
Workin' the streets, now they know they my hoes  
[J-Bo]  
I must ain't had it, I gotta get it  
Nothin' to lose, shoot me a quarter, and watch me flip it  
Shakin' these haters down the line, they somethin' wicked  
You on a roll then pay yo' dues, then buy a ticket  
Gather your cheddar 'round this world, there's nothin' better  
But keep it boomin' like a system, through any weather  
Stackin' my green, that's somethin good, I'm on a mission  
Trappin' hard just like I should, no penny pinchin'  
And for the gold, we steady missin', and reminisin'  
Buy some S, ain't even hittin', so stop yo' flippin  
'cause when I pull in all my cheese you besta know  
There ain't no playin' wit my thang when you see my foe  
Act like ya know

sometimes sick to my stomach (ohhh)  
but I love this girl Tequila  
one shot of her love, it's over  
she takes all my money  
and all I want to do is hold her....Tequila  
my Mexican lover

I cannot forget her, my Mexican lover  
with that and its strong, can mix her up with no other  
her name Tequila, we met in October  
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa  
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive  
we stay at the bar 'cause she ain't that expensive  
don't give me no problems when I'm with her  
nice brown tone, she got me slither  
my girl tequila, a jump me you say so  
I'll serve you what ever you pay for  
her nickname Quevo, eighteen honda  
she got you woozy, got you sick to the stomach  
the girl's a club hoe, a two shine dub hoe  
not far from a drug hoe, get your back by the PO-PO  
you're fuckin' with quevo, the girls a killer  
I'll have you at the bar takin' shots of Tequila  
my Mexican lover..

see I'm so true pursuing, straight getting right to it  
on late nights we get tight, in ways I can't refuse it  
like cupids, we undisputed, and together ruthless  
and all the other hoes feelin' low, lookin' stupid  
thought we was, we was two of a kinda cuttin'a rug  
in back of the club, two of the most dangerous thugs  
soakin' up your brain, driving you insane  
and leaving you to lay on your back constrained  
with no complaint, she's off the chain like no other  
my Mexican lover, the only one on my covers  
like hustlers, she got me tipsy she's got me voo-doo

Um, Mark Twayne  
Now it's time to let y'all nigga know about me  
Oh I can get mo money, mo money, don't come to me  
And everything I say that be on the blow  
Rap for the love of money, stack it up once mo'  
Going once, going twice, got the O for the LOW  
Got my cheese in the soil, tryin' to make my flow grow  
Hell no, never fall off  
Slip pimpin', you can get it hard or get it soft  
All day, round the clock tryin' to get it in  
I ain't worried bout' the rich, cause I'm in the wind  
All I got is my folks, Lord forgive me for my sins  
And if this ain't for me, please make me thank again  
Gotta get my shit right, tight like these gurls draws  
Let me recognize the game, and all the flaws  
While I'm out here, please let me come up  
And watch my every step so I don't have to duck  
Never wanted this, damn how a nigga stuck?  
Hit me on the hill nigga, I'm a' sack it up  
Rabbit on my head all day for good luck  
On the hustle everyday, but who really gives a fuck  
hook  
So what you got, when you ain't got nothing to show  
Thangs movin' slow, can't get your hands on no blow  
Ain't got no flow, naw, need some quick cash  
If hustlin' is the answer nigga, get up off your ass  
I walk about the crib, with my mind on the dough  
Been hustlin' these verses, ain't got a damn thang to show  
I keep my head up, because I feel it's bout to pop  
Done heard about a deal going down at the dock  
Critics say it don't stop, til' you get it and it's gone  
It's all about the fett', set it off, get it crunk  
You catch me on the corner, I'll be buddy with the sacks  
Off in the studio it be Twayne with the tracks  
Fire, fire, like that dope gettin' smoked everyday  
Got a call from my source, he on the way with the llell' (yeah)  
Coming in from overseas, bout' 82 ki's  
Not a word to be said, everybody hit your knees, lets leave  
Get the cheese, make away with the blow  
Slip in the door, right before we do the show  
Mr. Dope Man, your looking kinda sick  
Thangs movin' slow now that you ain't got shit  
hook  
So what you got now, you out of luck  
Sellin' your soul to the devil, just to make a quicker buck  
But for what, you took a chance, receiving half of some blow  
And pushing them quarter ki's underground to keep the flow  
It's toe to toe, we can take it to the deepest of the seas  
And anybody else who want to bite, then try a piece  
Of these Youngbloodz, bustin' 30 slugs, so just perhaps  
You crawlin' out of a shell  
Finding ways up out these traps  
Like craps, you out to gamble, losing everything you own  
And still like to pretend as if this game gonna keep em' known  
And do know, you in a ball of burning hell  
So might as well take a ride on the weed into the A-T-L  
And niggas swear we outdone and out-gunned  
So what's the first attempt when they got you on the run  
With fun, they shootin' tons of shots, so whose to blame  
Nobody but yourself as you hold inside the pain

With niggaz waitin on the commissary  
Locked in solitary confinement, no more grindin, wifey pondin diamonds  
I'm a frontline soldier like a lineman  
Guns firin', sirens, that's all in my environment  
Gangstas, pimps, thugs, that's all in my environment  
Niggaz that's slung drugs with no thoughts of retirement  
Ballin, timin, grindin, that's all in my environment  
Expirement, when I blaze you up fuck the firemen  
Call the coroner, set up shop on the corner  
With rocks and marijauna, make it hot as a sauna  
It's just another day in Oakland, California  
I touch G's and never had a diploma, like that  
[Hook 2x]  
[Verse 2]  
When you was learnin how to boogaloo and pop lock  
I was baggin opium and bloons at the hop spot  
And slangin double ups to goons at the rock spot  
We got the block locked, and give a fuck if the cops watch  
This chop chop and turn ya car into a drop top  
Just like a chop shop, blak blak, make a cop drop  
Keep ya mouth shut, our neighbors don't talk to cops about us  
They know we'll come and shoot they fuckin house up  
Rock ya ounce up, with ya little arm and hammer  
I'm breakin pounds up, with jack knives and sledge hammers  
Some of my niggaz in the feds locked up in the slammer  
Some of my niggaz got bread then headed for Atlanta  
My family put the murder game down like Alpo  
I hate my algebra class but still love to count dough  
Niggaz is breakin like turbo and o-zone  
I was pushin O's on the block until the dope gone  
[Hook 2x]  
[Verse 3]  
When you was spinnin techniques learnin DJ shit  
I was tryin to touch and hundred ki's like Freeway Rick  
I was rollin with a mossberg like DJ Quik  
Out here the Feds and the D.A. hit over he say shit  
The block hot like a heatwave hit  
But I'ma bubble on the low just like Freeway shit  
I'ma follow all the codes, never be a snitch  
Just concentrate on this ""D"" I whip and this ""V"" I flip  
I stay Fila'd down in mobsta suits  
If you talk to cops I shoot, let the choppa loose  
Rest in Peace to Tupac and Big Poppa too  
I never boogaloo like shaba do, I'm a mobsta, dude

Skatin on two 85's  
Wouldn't believe half the shit that's skatin through a niggas mind

Chickens on my dick 'cause a nigga fresh and smellin good  
Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck  
Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck

Harder to maintain it all

Can't even get credit cards  
And they Momma stay in projects  
How is that? Scratch my head  
Somethin don't seem right  
Ya teeth full of ice  
So when ya smile I seen lights  
Seems like I'm hatin I'm just statin the facts

Trickin them ass and titties  
Bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it

But I ain't fuckin around 'cause there is too much shit goin around  
Like the rims on my pickup  
Scared to get my dick sucked  
Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup  
Pick up the pieces from the fuckin puzzle  
I'm affiliated with niggas who murder, rob and hustle  
Plus you think I'm ballin 'cause I'm poppin Crys and spendin G's

Nigga please, I ain't shit  
Cookies and cream

Now half the shit ya doin already been done  
And that's why half my niggas dead, locked up or on the run  
That dope money ain't sufficient it don't last all ways  
Niggas trap all night in project hallways  
All day long niggas front like stars  
On them big ass rims that most than they cars  
Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes  
But his baby needs wopes, diapers and pedialite  
And you prolly' got a cousin, brother or a friend  
And this song sound like it from begging to end  
Then again it might be me  
And I'm tired of the nonsense  
Can't sleep at night cause I got a guilty conscience

When a friend becomes a stranger,

Where do you go, where do you go,

Behind a misty glass, on a windowpane,

After lies are told,  
And the light of truth is blown out,

They showed him how to share, and took him by the hand,  
Showed him the path to Heaven, through the desert sand

Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl  
Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna' hear it, I ain't tryna' know ya  
Unless you be a hustler tryna' come up on some mo' bucks  
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun  
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond  
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march  
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross  
Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south  
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers cause we all be runnin' our route  
I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong  
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain  
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne  
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)

Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness  
Kickin' it with the jealous got me beggin' for forgiveness  
This record label presidential think they live like me  
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me  
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name  
But they can't sell records without me that's a goddamn shame  
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check  
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!  
Every time I speak bitch niggas steadily be plottin'  
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison  
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out  
But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out  
God blessed the child that can double his fetti  
Duckin' and dodgin' trouble cops and trouble times come get me  
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone  
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home

From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
  
Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto  
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go  
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level  
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel  
And pouring gas too, if there evidence  
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went  
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence  
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence  
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining  
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds  
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it  
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it  
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers  
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter  
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters  
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got diamonds all in my mouth, in my grill and in my jaws  
Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball  
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier  
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine
clear  
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ  
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a
lamp  
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone
Star State  
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey
Tape  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill  
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill  
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill  
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal  
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked  
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch  
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring  
If you ain't spend thirty, tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

Blucka-blucka-blucka, that's how my gun go  
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe  
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though  
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those  
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall  
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all  
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call  
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out  
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp  
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip  
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get  
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip  
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips  
These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips  
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch  
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth  
  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South

Try to get me, so now my people be scared to come and chill with me  
Fuck y'all, I'm one deep till I D-I-E  
Displaying off some boxing game, when H-O-E's try me  
An S.U.C. Guerilla Maab veteran, constantly head busting

Something holla dog, and that's for all of y'all

Everytime I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
Now they thinking, I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby  
I want my mama, cause I'm having bad dreams and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
Live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law went North, to Lufkin and Nacogdoches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Till my out of town connect, pulled out two techs and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I taste  
His get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face

Instead of making you an employee, nigga I made you a friend  
Now look what you lose, your Q's and handle fections stealing your ends  
I've been behind the scenes, but in front of the schemes  
Organized the team, for you to realize your dream  
That's how you pay me back, you funny fake fraud and flipper  
Over pennies and nickels, they turned sour like milk  
It's no wonder why, so many'll never see fortune and fame  
Fuck what you claim motherfucker, you never endue it no pain

To make a nigga want to roll something  
But I'm they closest partner, if I let them hold something  
Good for nothing, but making me hate my peers  
So let the world taste my tears  
When they roll, they represent anger, paranoid with one in the chamber  
To live the heads shots to my foes, and make them through with Dana  
And when they splash it's a blood bath, and I trust no one  
Ain't no more chunking up the deuce, when my thugs pass  
Live my life in silentary vomet away from y'all  
If I needed artillery could I even get the K from y'all  
I'm all alone in the ways of the wicked, since I can't stand you hoes  
Forever lonely when I kick it, in the lumino  
With straps and shells, my life is murder and mail  
The opposition see me coming, and they blast they self  
This for my homies that don't know me, when I'm broke  
Swear to God I hope you motherfuckers choke, when my gun smoke, hate

The H is for these hoe niggas that's all in my face  
And the A is for the actions that these bitch niggas take  
And the T is for the tommy gun that's bout to blast  
And the E is for eternal cause I ever last

Facing homicide from haters, but my homies didn't even spill rounds  
Fuck y'all, I hate you motherfuckers to death  
Remember times, when I stopped niggas from clutching your chest  
I live in bulletproof vests, but it seems  
The only time I got family, is when a nigga dream  
So fuck sleep, I'm on a 24 hour grind  
Look at your darling son, now mama I'm out of my mind  
I don't know how to be happy and I can't smile, and fuck a bitch  
Cause she be plotting on how to get you, when y'all walking down the isle  
The same motherfuckers that you care for, look how they do you  
They don't love you pick up your pistol, and therefor  
Represent yourself with the plastic, cause me myself  
Want to put all of you motherfuckers in caskets  
Fuck love, unless it's coming from the heaven up above  
My hatred being written in blood, hate

There ain't no telling if a nigga make it, I might be stuck in the slums  
A walking target steady ducking the gun  
But even me and you can keep your wife, there'll be no hostages  
Just give me what I'm looking for, and keep your life  
I'm military minded, you can ask Klondike Kat  
Even if they bomb first, Z-Ro is bout to bomb right back  
I give a fuck about your life now, slugs hitting your windpipe now  
Guess you could say I'm living shife now  
All about my fetty, till I bubble like some champagne  
Z-Ro the Crooked, the most valuable player up in this rap game  
So back back, back back, be sure to give me more than fifty  
Automatic rounds, down to pass that  
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends  
Because they turned on a nigga, when I ain't have no ends, hate  
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends  
Because they turned on a nigga, when a nigga wasn't chopping a Benz, hate

Though I'm not into one night stands, I'm eager to see you out your clothes  
Please don't take it the wrong way, I'm just spectating  
But I won't lie, and say I'm not thinking about sex making  
It was on my mind real strong, but I don't want to rush  
We can remain friends, for a real long time  
By then I'd know, if I've been dealing with a strong mind  
Either business brain, the drugged up and gone mind  
But that's irrelevant, I'm speaking for the present baby

Trying to handcuff me, you moving too quick  
Not trying to be seen in public with you, at the movies and shit  
Chances are you got a man, he gon be mad if he see you  
So let's keep our thing undercover, so nobody know what we do  
Long as we do it like that, we can do it long  
Make it a while since we did it last, so we do it strong  
It's in my blood, to be as straight up as I can be  
And straight up I can see you in my jacuzzi, chilling with me

Another bad ass yellow bone, talking dirty to me  
She say she ready for me, to come and make my round  
Telling me how she gon do me, I'm ready to break right now  
As soon as I got in my ride, 'fore I made it out the driveway  
The twins hit my celly, said that they were coming my way  
Double the pleasure double the fun, I can't miss that  
A menage with the Asian persuasion, I had to hit that  
Making money all day long, is what I love  
But I'm trying to give up a minute or two, so you can fuck a thug  
And I won't waste your time, not a minute man  
Laying pipe with long jevity, always I'll be in it man  
And once I reach my conclusion, that ain't the end  
I'm just giving you a breather, baby go on and catch a wind  
Maybe that's the reason, all these women want to lay with me  
I'll show you if you want me to, just spend the night and play with me

This ain't gotta be, about a wam-bam thank you ma'am  
I'm not like these other fellas, although I know you think I am  
Even though I kick it, with a lot of females  
I can honestly tell you, that I ain't got a female  
Because I'm fresh out of jail, you prolly think that I just wanna bone  
Hit it quit it, then delete your number from my mobile phone  
Every man, needs a lady  
But I'm not trying to be your husband, only suggesting communication on the

I'm usually rude, with a bad attitude

To hit the Cinema Six, and catch a flick

Not a trick, but I love shopping for my lady friend  
You could be my one and only, right before the day begin  
I could drop you off at home, or you coming with me  
The early morning sun, is something to see  
Especially aboard a Carnival Cruise ship, you with it then let's get in the

Now this is how it is, to be my only homie lover friend

But how I'm gon try to give somebody the world, and they shit in my hand  
We can kick it, but I really don't know what's on your agenda  
Are you serious about me, or just another pretender

Scratch that with a fat stack, of Benjamin Franklin, y'all better  
Back back trying to get my stack, I got a black mack in a black backpack

I gotta handle my business, by myself cause I'm alone  
Really nothing to live fo', no more wife no more kids at home  
Ain't that a shame, I'm losing everything I love

I told him tell 'em twenty-five hundred, he told em three thousand  
Making me miss out on money, Sam gon' witness me clowning  
When you give a nigga a inch, they try to take the whole ruler  
After my inches, nothing but the forty-four rugger  
Who am I, Z-Ro the Crooked I'm not a hoe  
But instead of busting your head, I'ma go on and let you go

Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama  
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma  
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world  
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches  
Better murder they own people before they come up  
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up  
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber  
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers  
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old  
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul  
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it  
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it  
[Chorus x2]  
[Z-Ro]  
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven  
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons  
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face  
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place  
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon  
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'  
Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein  
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn  
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro  
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'  
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve  
All I want to do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.  
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off  
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off  
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it  
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it

That explain when you see me, why I reach in my pants  
Pull out my pistol, let a fade nigga straight bleed in they ass

'Fore I beat your bitch ass, without ever hanging up my phone  
Cause when I get wired up, niggaz get tied up

Understand you was in prison, and missing the game  
Understand me when I tell you, if you cross me you could die  
Might as well be a pigeon, cause your spirit fin to fly  
If you wasn't on ""Keep on Watching Me"", you ain't a Guerilla

This is my wooooooorld  
Z-Ro, king of the ghettoooooo  
[Z-Ro]  
Once upon a time, not long ago  
There was a hustling motherfucker, with a cold ass flow  
Everytime he hit the studio, his beeper go off  
He left the beef to get his cheese, by selling people that raw  
With a pistol on his right side, and one in his back  
I-10 again and again, from running that crack  
Girlfriend kept complaining, cause he never at home  
So he told her deal with it bitch, or get the fuck on  
It was money over bitches, on his mind  
Plus all of his partnas, thought that he would never shine  
The number be 15 and 5, up in the kitchen  
He could do it straight up, or he could do it with a whipping  
But then came a drought, and then he put his first album out  
Decided to do it full time, cause record stores kept selling out  
Still in the game, cocaine on top of the brain  
From the studio to the streets, Z-Ro is everything  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
King of the ghetto, I'm sitting on my throne  
Got a red light, sitting on my chrome  
Ridgemont Texas, representing  
With a taper fade, sitting on my dome  
I mash niggaz, and I trash niggaz  
When it come down, to the cash nigga  
Beat that ass, in a flash nigga  
Pistol play, and I'ma blast nigga  
Gangstafied, from Goderhead  
All day long, I chase my bread  
But on the low, I don't fuck with FED's  
Cause a snitch nigga, get dressed in red  
Shut up bitch, she look so lie  
But they don't know, she'll take your life  
Not giving a fuck, or get fucked up  
And end up dead, with your dick in the sky  
Go my way, we gon have fun  
Instead of happiness, we have done  
About our business, corrupting our kidneys  
All that codeine, weed and drugs  
I'm leaning over, but still a soldier  
Pimp my pen, like I'm suppose to  
Nothing but the finest, light green doja  
Got it from see-Note, from the Clover  
Animal thug, I thug for life  
So I ain't going, to the club tonight  
Block is bleeding, I'm here for the eating  
And supervising, my funds tonight  
I scuffle and hustle, on my grind  
No matter the weather, no matter the time  
Roll out the red carpet for Z-Ro, this world is mine  
[Hook - 2x]

Who that bumping, who that beefing  
Hope you brought something, to put your chief in  
Interrupting me, while I'm reefer chiefing  
I'm a gangsta, not Erkle Steven  
Cause I don't laugh, and I don't play  
And no, is something that I don't say  
I don't give a motherfuck, about your day  
Hoe, get the fuck out of my way  
I'm lean as fuck, and don't like nobody  
My style of rap, is I'm like nobody  
I let off fo' shots, and hit fo' bodies  
OG with it, like Amas Rodney  
Still in the game, as a MVP  
Dealing with haters, that envy me  
Fuck fabricated, and commercializing  
I'ma bring my block, to MTV  
Show love, and do all I can  
For all my people, and all my fans  
But motherfuckers, be hating me  
For the life of me, I can't understand  
Cause I'm cool as hell, till a hater get bold  
Step out of line, fuck around get stoled  
I must be, their motherfucking issue  
Cause all these niggaz, getting drove  
Up a lot, like a Volkswagon  
I get a commission, for toe tagging  
A slim killa, with a wide body  
Polo top, and Polo sagging  
I live my life, like I don't care  
But every night, I be deep in prayer  
Then I get off, my knees  
And hustle, straight like that there

On a mission fishing for feddy, ready to make a knot  
I'm use to having less, and I just can't deal with the stress  
And it seems like everywhere I go, another nigga want to test  
Brother don't disrespect yourself and get yourself up in a, vine  
Cause I'm a maniac with a mac, and a black back-pack  
Smoking up on the urban fat sack, I'm trying to keep from going off  
But niggas be trying to make me starve, when I need groceries in my house  
Wicked niggas say they be friends, but end up trying to kill your friends  
Always turn to foes, that's saying it's over millions  
Dealing with dirty niggas on a daily basis  
Don't really want to fuck with em, but see they baby faces  
I gotta survive

Pretty soon, you'll see man  
That I'm a real rich nigga from the Houston streets  
Fried out licking, looking for something to eat  
I'm on a mission, whipping birds like they stole something  
Pain, it make me want to roll something  
I'm a soldier, and I'm outta my mind  
Voice mail beeping for days, cause I'm out on the grind  
Guess my daddy didn't love me, cause he turned his back  
Therefor the streets is my people, a nigga learned like that

And it don't stop

My nigga Herman Fisher doing fed time  
I remember like it was yesterday, it made the headlines, damn  
I had to start all over, but it didn't matter cause I was a soldier  
Walking around with a king size chip on my shoulder  
Missing my mama while I Iay down, on benches to sleep  
Snatching purses and hopping fences just to eat  
Still I maintain, I'm still in the same game chasing paper  
Bitch niggas be up in my business, like oops I'm erasing haters  
I'm S.U.C. for life, KMJ until I'm finished  
Like Popeye from the ghetto, but a nigga don't need no spinach  
All I need is my Nina when I be flipping birds

Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with  
Dreams and hopes  
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from  
Songs I wrote  
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill  
My shoes  
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill  
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues  
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way

Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine  
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family  
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T  
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em

Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay  
Broke  
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day  
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when  
She come home  
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month  
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome  
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck  
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick  
Give me a couple of zeros on a check

Rock and buy these bezzels, and then I bust  
Geniva watch, telling me it's time to ball  
Get in the line till I make it to the front, and then it's time to fall  
But if I ever fall off, just fall back behind the scene  
Take seven, catch me up in sitcoms and big screens

I think I'm ready, because this world ain't no friend of mine  
Only thing I qualify for, is murder and Penitentiary time  
y'all should of shot me, in the jimmy instead  
But I guess they was feeling eachother, to get head in the bed  
Here I am, first born torn between heaven and hell  
I tell my people so no to dope, but I let it sell  
Need to practice my preaching, calling the kettle black  
I know I'm on pot before or not, I gotta peddle crack  
Ain't nobody got my back, except the laws when they on it

Telling my people fuck him, cause he be working through my homies  
Burning bridges, and I don't give a fuck  
Remember y'all laughing at me, when I couldn't get a buck  
It's all gravy baby, I got bigger hurdles I'm trying to jump over my residence

Got a nigga with an attitude, I can't maintain  
If you cross me I'll bring it to you hard, not softly  
Living like I'm invincible, one day it's gonna cost me  
When it's time to pay up, and I lay up in a grave  
Bury me with a fifty sack, and a motherfucking 12 gauge  
Hey, no love in my heart  
Cause my homies was phony, straight from the motherfucking start  
Why couldn't I get a ride, if I ain't have no weed, these motherfuckers  
Ain't my people, they gotta be strangers up a reverend breed  
So I bless the streets, with my smith-n-wesson

She for real, bitch run round in a Kia  
Put her in the Bentley coupe, and moved her to the crib  
  
Southern girl, (yeah she a down South bitch)  
That's all I need in my southern world, (yeah I'm on that down South shit)  
Yeah-yeah Southern girl, yeah, yeah yeah-e-yeah  
I'm on that down South shit, rolling with my down South bitch  
  
I use to be an asshole, now I'm a grown man  
King of the Ghetto, while ruling over my own land  
Regular women, ain't invited to my home man  
Pretty face big booty, whip up a zone hand  
That ain't sweet and sour chicken, cooking in the kitchen  
And that ain't just her home girl, they both into licking  
She'll set you up for that paper, place you into position  
Them thangs or your life, one of em coming up missing  
She cornbread fed, almost thicker than my pocket  
Already came five times, but she ain't stopping  
She fuck with rich niggas, but she don't be name dropping  
When you see her with them rich niggas, bet she ain't bopping  
Always see her from the back, she never face front  
Never turn to comb my hair, that's why she rock a lace front  
Ain't no handcuffing, you can taker her home today brah  
She don't belong to Mr. McVey brah, homie she's a

Z-Ro,Where Is The Love,/z/z+ro/where+is+the+love_20339938.html,"[Chorus]  
Where is the love - 2x  
[Z-Ro]  
Nobody loves me, but I prefer to keep it like that  
Cause most friends are falsified trying to steal out your stack  
So I keep my partnas to a minimum even though I know half can't be trusted  
The only feeling in the world might steal your girl if I know flesh was lusted  
Nigga now who was to blame for the pain cause fucking with me nigga you get
sprayed  
Hardheaded that's like fucking a bitch with no condom  
And knowing that hoe got aids, better be smart, better keep your distance  
Ain't got elements from loose leaf pages  
When I'm going off in the rage of furious chambers of twin gauges  
My calico murders offending my mind and my mind is so ready to click  
Better freeze, better not breathe all I want is the money  
Remember you dead if you twitch, cause I'm a killa that's killing for cash  
I show no car crash when I'm stealing your stash  
Don't fill in the streets because I'm too fast  
But never revealing what's under my mask  
I'm making a dash, I jump in the Hoover and I smash  
With a foot on the gas and then I'm off in the night  
A nigga was buried alive  
but he really should of died dig him up his coffin too tight  
A nigga was showing a busta love, but now it's hunting for a busta season  
And he can't be the reason, to run in your crib and leave you bleeding  
[Chorus - 4x]  
(talking)  
The question at hand is  
Where's your motherfucking love  
I'ma do like that boy Al D said  
I'm showing love to the ones that showed love back  
Fuck friends, so Mexican D, Grady  
You know where your love at  
[Z-Ro]  
I was raised to never let em see me sweat  
And how to dodge bullets never let em hit my chest  
I saw the ways of the wise and how to live in peace  
But fate said we got to stand and fight the beast with open eyes  
Which means I got to keep my glock, on a day to day basis  
Always protect myself and no more catching murder cases  
Niggas will try to erase me and that's a fact, but if I got to go  
Nigga I be damned if my trigga finger isn't pulling back  
I had niggas I was real with and use to chill with  
Now they coming to me with the drama that I can't deal with  
I think they out to get me but I can't let em, just like Pac and Spice 1  
The jealous got me strapped, so when I go to spraying I'ma wet him  
I had love for y'all, I use to cut for y'all  
Nigga we was family I shed blood for y'all  
But now you hate me cause of my progress, you want me dead  
I'm waiting on you niggas you know my address  
But if my name is on the bullet and I die, you got to  
Lay it down one day guess who gone be waiting on the other side  
Go on and pull your pistol from your belt, but no man  
Can take my life away from me until I lay it down my damn self  
Tried to kill me once and paralyze my mobility  
Now that I can walk again don't even think about getting me  
Not saying I won't die, you hoes can try to murder me and get me  
And if I kick the fuck it nigga, fuck it you kicking it with me  
Cause I'ma be drama best to put to the rest cause you don't understand  
That I ain't down with dying at the hands of another man

Z-Ro versus the world, feel me round one

Is it reality or just a fable  
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label  
Even if I don't clear me in I just want to be living well  
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I don't want to believe in hell  
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me  
If it ain't the stress somebody's always trying to bury me  
So thinking I'm undercovers and the dope they try to deal me  
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me  
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be  
drilling me nigga  
But I' sick of this pistol play bumping ain't no more killng me nigga  
Cause I'm a soldier, trying to keep his mind at ease  
And if I squeeze then we all bleed  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Feel a nigga worldwide, not just in Texas  
I think I'm bout to lose my mind, aggravated and restless  
I don't want to die  
[Z-Ro]  
Look at how they made me, traditon systems raised me  
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me  
They tell me that my mind's gone, coming up is what my mind's on  
I guess there's nothing left to do but get my grind on  
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me  
I'm not gonna give up, I'm gonna make my family respect me  
I'm talking to my father now, daddy I'm a grown up  
Depending on you is false-a-fied because you haven't shown up  
Caught up in these streets I'm taking penitentiary chances  
I done forgived and I done forget plus I'm not giving you anymore chances  
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger  
Remember the times you couldn't come around because your life has been in
danger  
I'm a leader to follow is not my destiny  
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy  
It's killing me to stay alive, but there ain't no use in me crying  
No matter what I guess it's what is right, on southside  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Whoever would of thought that I would be this fam-ous  
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending it's pain it's  
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death  
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest  
It's hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother  
Everybody stressing cause ain't nobody feeling eachother  
I often conversate with god but who's to say if he's listening  
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian  
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes  
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds  
If it ain't true, if it ain't crew, it's a mexican deed  
I'ma catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me  
And ain't no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga  
And I swear to god everywhere you go it's gone be hot my nigga  
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different  
They want you dead you might not make it to prison, bitch

Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine  
Where the peaches grow  
And my house it's not much to talk about

Then I'ma roll one up  
Like my name is Bob  
Yeah I'm gonna party like I'm a Jamaican

Grab a drink beside me

And we can find somebody who can play the steel drums  
And if you like this beat then everybody dance with me  
We got the ladies to the left  
Fellas to the right

And we are gonna dance to the rhythm of the waves  
While we drink Bacardi by the bonfire flames

Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  
Had sweet love but I lost it  
She got too close so I fought it  
Now I'm lost in the world tryin' to find me a better way  
  
Wishin' I was  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair  
The only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Wrote a note, said ""Be back in a minute""  
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it  
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway  
Mind on a permanent vacation  
The ocean is my only medication  
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away  
  
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
This champagne shore watchin' over me  
It's a sweet sweet life livin' by the salty sea  
One day you can be as lost as me  
Change your geography and maybe you might be  
  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

The waters nice  
Find yourself a little slice  
Grab a backpack  
Otherwise you'll never know until you try  
When you lose yourself  
You find a key to paradise

Some put on a suit, but he ran the other way  
Drums drown out the yuppies  
And the ones who couldn't dream  
'Cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything

Until it's gone

You try to do what's right  
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation  
To the big band in the sky  
  
Rollin' down the windows  
Trying hard to fight the sleep  
Money's never much for a band in Tennessee  
Another night of playin'  
To a crowd with no ears  
Wanna hear the songs they know  
And fill their bellies full of beer  
  
But they don't know

Fell into a dream that never dies  
And when the thunder comes  
You can hear his kick drum in the sky  
Feel the rain  
Fall from our eyes  
  
'Cause we don't know  
What we got  
Until it's gone  
Like it or not

You try to do what's right

Got his silver invitation  
To do a little playing  
For the big band in the sky

Torn from his home.  
Well, he was naked,  
And destined  
To be out on his own.  
And he waited in darkness,  
Hoping someone might see,  
From something so rough,  
What a treasure he'd be.  
  
Stronger than steel and wood.  
Seen me through the bad and good.  
And when I'm hanging by a string,  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
Between Martin and me.  
  
He's hollow in the middle  
From the shape that he's in.  
He's either filled up with music  
Or locked in his shell again.  
And it takes some fine tuning  
To make him come around,  
But he's a huge piece of me  
And I'll never put him down.  
  
Stronger than steel and wood.  
Seen me through the bad and good.  
And when I'm hanging by a string,  
Every little thing  
Is understood  
Between Martin and me.  
  
He is a good friend,  
And he has his own voice.  
And you get what you give,  
Sometimes it's just noise.  
But if you treat him well  
He will last your life long.  
And if you're honest and open  
Well, he will write you a song.  
(Write you a song, write you a song)  
  
Stronger than steel and wood.  
Seen me through the bad and good.

My daddy said to me  
Many mountains we must climb  
Before we'll be free  
But he never told me  
About the bruises on my knees  
How they would be the map  
That leads to where we need to be  
That sun goes down  
Forty days, forty nights  
  
Who knows  
What the thunder and lightning will bring  
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams  
Maybe the sun will shine no more  
Who knows  
Which way the wind is blowing  
And when we look back on these things  
We won't cry no more

Wandering blindly  
Searching for the truth  
And anchored to a solid rock  
That we could hold on to  
But there's no tomorrow  
Not for everyone  
Who will hear your last harsh words  
When your time on earth is done  
That sun goes down down  
Forty days, forty nights  
  
Who knows  
What the thunder and lightning will bring  
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams  
Maybe the sun will shine no more  
Who knows  
Which way the wind is blowing  
And when we look back on these things  
We won't cry no more

Don't let the wind blow it out  
Oh guide the light child  
'Cause one day it's gonna shine  
Sing up 'til the darkness it is lifted  
Sing up 'til the darkness it is lifted

This is what your black hearts pray  
  
Time moves as slow as the ocean's tide  
Neon explosion in the haggard sky  
No sun shall set  
Lest we forget  
Man's will be done  
  
The last Lamb  
The last hope  
The last song from Zion

The eyes of mothers bleeding  
Cast their children to the sea

So divine and unkind  
  
The lesser lights of heaven are burning for their Son  
Praying for the presence  
That birthed them into one  
  
The lesser lights of heaven, their bodies but a flame  
A sky that knows no distance  
A cut that feels no pain  
  
The lesser lights of heaven are bending towards your will  
Cutting through the person  
Who would rather die than kill  
  
The lesser lights of heaven cast crowns before your throne  
Dissipate into nothing  
We truly are alone  
  
Can we live through this? The lesser lights of heaven

Unable yet at peace  
Unable yet scared  
  
I'm racing racing towards it with fear and excitement  
They seem inseparable  
They seem so far apart  
They are my close friends  
  
They are my very ghosts  
I'm racing towards it  
Holding perfectly still  
In the race of standing still

Left to right, sit and talk shit all night  
Does that make it right for smoke  
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?  
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear  
  
You don't even wanna know about the things I hear  
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal  
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position  
You'll be fishing for far too long  
You're the bad guy in this movie  
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution  
And the only solution is making shit confusing  
  
Ain't about who's winning or losing  
It's bout the path you're choosing  
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing  
When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising  
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings  
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring  
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality  
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity  
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me  
  
Bullseye, you the dot to me  
Emotions splattered, same pattern, can't even begin to spot 'em

No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth

Who owns the keyless door  
Where does the circle end  
Who are the unwatched men

I was punch drunk, spinnin' round, heading for a fall  
Do or die now, got scared, so I stalled  
You can have it all  
Your eyes inside the back of my mind  
Stars collide to see who outshines  
Your eyes inside the back of my mind  
It's making me blind  
We can hate  
We can hate each other  
We can be down then fuck one another  
We can hold it up, then set it on fire  
Life is sacrifice and you can be a martyr  
But it's more than I can stand  
When you're looking down on me  
Cause I can't live up to you, that makes me incomplete  
I never wanted anything more  
So I'll just say good-bye and watch you walk out the door  
I want to be all you want me to be  
I want to be all you think that you see  
Would you leave me here when nobody cares?  
I tried really hard not to care at all  
Medicate myself  
Xanax, alcohol  
My admissions made me feel so small  
You can keep it all  
I can change  
We can change for each other  
We can let go and accept one another  
We can tear it down to the ground and start over  
Life is compromise [Repeat x2]  
So if I let you down then I'll pick you up again  
In the end  
Suspend confidence in me to come through  
To be who I want to be and to do what I want to do  
Never turn my back on you

Okay  
Face-plant to the ground

You set the bar I could not live up to  
Tonight the light in breaking through  
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell  
  
This relationship is over as we scrape the ledge  
and you call me a loser falling over the edge  
Like you're cutting all your losses  
Like a bet you can hedge  
One two, fuck you!  
I won't change for you  
  
A black eye  
and my heart is ripped out of my chest  
Crucified  
For not passing any of your stupid tests  
Good-bye  
Right now I could care less  
  
I won't change for you  
I won't change for you

Don't look down!

Too bad it was the wrong way  
Won't be long now  
Till we hit the rock  
Bottom

Zebrahead,Runaway,/z/zebrahead/runaway_10198503.html,"She wakes up in the morning  
In the same room that she's been in her whole life  
And everything still looks the same  
But the feeling of the room has changed in spite  
  
She said  
""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind""  
She said  
""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind all the time""  
  
Bruised lips and the make-up  
Tattooed hips and pierced  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She don't belong here  
Old tricks that she made up  
  
Attitude  
I don't give a fuck  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She says I won't belong So long  
It's not a lost cause  
She's just a runaway  
  
Is there nothing left for you to say?  
And if she comes home  
Do you think she'll want to stay?  
Is there anything for her?  
She's a runaway  
Turn your back on yesterday  
She calls at seven thirty  
  
And wants to talk about her boyfriend one last time  
Mom and Dad are fighting in the background,  
Shattered glass cuts through red wine  
I said,  
""I don't know that I'm right but I know that you're wrong""

Blacked out  
Passed out at a party  
In another town  
With the same old Bacardi  
Nothing ever changes what's inside me  
Someone find me, someone find me  
My heart showed me the way out  
  
Don't stop  
Don't give up on me now  
Two beats, two streets  
Too many repeats to blow my only other way out

Zebrahead,Someday,/z/zebrahead/someday_20148936.html,"Late out the door, grab my clothes off the floor,  
Backpack and books cause school is a chore  
Coming straight out the block, punk rock ain't no shock,  
Blue hair everywhere cause we got the stock  
Slide by all the narcs, as the late alarm barks,  
Take a nap in the class on a film about sharks  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you  
  
Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie by my side  
I don't really care cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride  
Someday I'm going to be there  
  
Step out in the hall, with the girls dressed like dolls,  
And the burn-outs are baked as they step out the stalls  
See the games that they play, cause they practice all day,  
And the more that I see the less I have to say but  
It's a quarter to ten, by your locker again,  
Cause I know you'll be coming round the corner with your friend  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you  
  
Listen when I say  
Today is the day  
And I'm on my way  
  
See you when you're wandering by  
And you still catch my eye  
Blow my mind  
Cause my face you won't recognize  
  
I know that it's crazy, how you seem to phase me,  
When nothing else matters but that all escapes me  
This is a new trip, got to get a better grip,  
A day in the life and you know I'm going to take it  
And then you turn and walk away, before I have a chance to say,  
I know that you can make this all okay  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you

Free style form not the norm

And don't try to wreck cause kid you'll get rolled  
On the flip side if you choose to decide  
Wreck it from New York to Cali or anywhere I reside  
So check out the crew with the funk flow flavor  
Spitting out smooth sounds that you know that you want to savor  
  
I wish you could see all the that I see  
Back in the day you were down with me  
Back in the day when things were all right  
Check out the lights  
Check out the sounds that I found all underground  
And the swing that I bring up all around  
Watch the walls as they all come crumbling down  
Check out the shake and the quake as I kick it down  
This is the bomb track and we never take it back  
Funky fresh flow is something that we never lack  
So get up and ride this and never try to bite this  
Aim for the sky cause you never know you might miss

The system try to stop the power  
No way they can  
I got the power to move you  
  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
Now I say things happen just like that  
When music play who knows what step will drop  
Can you feel if it's creeping up on you  
It's gonna get you berfore you know what to do  
Turn you inside out  
Make you scream and shout  
The vibe is building  
Crazy reggae rhythm  
  
I got the power to move you  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
  
So don't you try to stop  
What you feel inside  
When we hit that spot  
We tell ya world collide  
Some people try to stick  
TO what they know outside  
Acting like a programmed chip  
We tell them free they mind  
  
I got the power to move you

Yeah, I am living in this world so corrupt  
You are living in a world so corrupt  
  
There is a way which seems so right to men  
But it end leadeth to destruction  
Even in gladness the heart weeps  
And the end of joy is grief  
Oh the end of joy is grief  
Don't lose your way find it today  
And don't drop the speed, people in need  
Don't lose your way, find it today  
I don't drop my speed, the people in need

With chords of vanity, they call evil God  
Put darkness for light, bitter for sweet  
Woe unto dem who are wise  
In their own eyes, what a life  
Behind the scene eyes nuh see  
What governments hide  
C.I.A should D.O.A., K.G.B. should R.I.P.

The Bible was changed to suit King James  
Many empty lies, hear say, hear say, hear say  
John public blind, public want to know the truth today  
And the world became this way  
Because the trick in the trade  
They refuse to see it, save the people pray

We're in a slummy economic mess  
Whole world is crying, whole world is dying

And when your dreams have been delayed  
You've got the strength to wait  
So keep on waiting  
  
You're not sugar and spice and everything nice  
You've got character and you paid the price  
You're not after self-perfection  
You're living out your redemption  
What sets you apart from everyone else  
Is that you know your savior and you know him well  
What makes you different from all the rest  
Is that you won't let it get to you

Se si canta in due  
Passa meglio  
Hey fratello di una notte d'estate  
Ci facciamo un po'  
Compagnia

Che cammini come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Hey man  
Vieni e canta insieme a me  
Da questa parte della strada  
Che ci facciamo compagnia  
Guardo dentro agli occhi della gente  
Cosa cerco lo so  
Un altro uomo

She opened up her eyes and thought  
O' what a morning  
It's not a day for work  
It's a day for catching sun  
Just laying on the beach and having fun  
She's going to get you

To tell you I can't  
I'm drawing the line  
To greetings to understand  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
  
Da da capo  
Once again  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
I'm longing to see  
The offspring of me  
To hold it with my bare hands  
So talk about me as you used to do  
I'm with you from time to time  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
With your deeds all the time

Fightin for tha fame luvin this rap game  
Damn that's ma fantisy, but everybody's sayin to me that

Tryin to be good, tryin to forget that time wer A-Double-B

New Kid On Tha Glock brought me up, started rappin on beats from Shownuff  
You remember me, from Rais to Outlaw  
New album (Guess Whos Back), that's what i'ma bout more  
Even if death come to me, i aint got nothin to fear  
And i know there's gon happend some wrong this year

Rest in peace but still he rock  
Niggaz think i don't got something to say, so listen here  
Everyday i'm workin tryin to make ma songs pay  
I just wanna be heard, fuckas don't let me earn mine  
When you're a bad boy haters don't wanna see you shine  
So much pressure in this life of mine  
I cry times, Allah please show me tha right sign  
There's no one i can find, i smoked and got high

Rock 'n' Roll inside my head

You are just an image

You turn into a picture of somebody  
Someone I don't know  
Someone I don't feel

The sun will rise without

Adam Sandler,7 Foot Man,/a/adam+sandler/7+foot+man_20523071.html,"We just wrote this song on the bus the other day so just sit back and relax  
  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
I've committed no crime,  
Bumping my head into doorways,  
It happens all the time,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I repeat,  
They don't make a ski boot that can fit my feet,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I don't play basketball,  
  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
But I'm still just a man,  
So of course it hurts me a lot,  
When I walk into the ceiling fan,  
Small people say I wish I was him,  
But its been nine years since I've had a trim,  
The barber says,  
I can't reach the top of his head,  
  
7 foot man,  
(ha ha)I cannot hide,  
7 foot man,  
I know cause I've tried,  
7 foot man,  
My last girlfriend died,  
Because my penis,  
Is 7 foot wide!!!!!!!!!  
  
So the next time you see me,  
Walking around,  
And my head is right about to hit a tree branch,  
Tell me to duck down,  
And I'll pay you back ,  
Soon you will see,  
By getting you frisbee down from that tree,  
I do what i can,  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
  
7 foot man,  
7 foot man

Oh they day can't begin  
Till the gard lets me in  
Then I walk for some exersise  
  
In less then a snap  
I complete my daily lap  
Then it's time to socilize  
  
I see Raidy and Ruth  
At the Information Booth  
Have rigged the hearing lady  
At Ben and Jerry's Shake  
  
Then I go to Pet Land  
Where the manager stands  
Has about to be the dangorous stake  
  
Then I pass the tie rack  
On my way to Radioshack  
Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star  
I try to walk like John Wayne  
While singing in the rain  
And the Janitor laughs all the time!  
  
A little bit later,  
All the flash and the painter  
Was so high I had to close my eyes  
  
Janitor:  
He takes his 11: 30 crap  
  
Whitey:  
Then go over to the Gap  
And try clothes on for kids my size  
  
You want to go to Panda Express?  
Their spicey Chicken is the best!  
Go to Instant Barrel for a medium drink  
Cause their staff is really nice  
And they only use cubed ice  
Which is better then chushed I think  
  
Bangle lesson nothing sees [?]  
Look for chocolate heri-ings [?]  
Cuz he les me take a quich cat nap  
He says he misses his daughter  
Puts my hand in warm water  
And I wake up with a wet yellow lap  
  
Footlocker is my last stop  
Where I have to go and shop  
For some clean passings couples at a nice price  
  
Cuz when I leave the mall,  
I 'reff' Youth League basketball  
And to look your best... Never hurts  
But the greatest thing of all  
If the truth be told  
Here at the mall its never too hot or cold  
Cuz they were smart enough to make it truckin tall

This is a song that uhh..  
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..  
Not too many Chanukah songs.  
So uhh..  
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to  
Hear any Chanukah songs.  
Here we go...""  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Here comes Chanukah  
So much funukah  
To celebrate Chanukah  
Chanukah is the festival of lights  
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights  
  
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree  
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me  
David Lee Roth lights the menorah  
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah  
  
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli  
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli  
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too  
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew  
  
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""  
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr.Spock- both  
Jewish  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
It's time for Chanukah  
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs  
Celebrates Chanukah  
  
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew  
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted  
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby  
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish- not too shabby  
  
Some people think that Ebenezer  
Scrooge is  
Well he's not, but guess who is  
All three Stooges  
So many Jews are in showbiz  
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is  
  
Tell your friend Veronica  
It's time to celebrate Chanukah  
I hope I get a harmonicah  
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah  
So drink your gin and tonicah  
And smoke your marijuanikah  
If you really, really wannakah  
Have a happy, happy, happy,  
Happy Chanukah  
  
Happy Chanukah

Metabolism runnin' around so fast  
My body never gained no weight  
That pissed off all my Momma's friends  
And made my big-boned sister irate  
But now I'm a man  
And all that food frolicking has caused my ego to hurt  
'Cause even when I'm in the shower alone  
I'm too embarrassed to remove my shirt  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
And all them cookies I been munching lately  
My feets are becoming difficult to see  
I believe it was my Daddy  
Who led to this eating disease  
By calling me ""The Little Candy-ass""  
When I couldn't finish a burger with cheese  
Or maybe it was my Momma  
Who got me addicted to the wrong foods  
Only when I gobbled down every chicken cutlet  
Would I get to see Momma's good moods  
They said eat this, they said eat that  
To stay skinny there was no chance  
And now when I walk I hear corduroy  
Even though I ain't wearing pants

Made a fat mother-fucker outta me

What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me

And all that ice cream I been eatin' lately  
My chins alone weigh 203  
The diet starts tomorrow!  
I have a grapefruit for breakfast  
For lunch a bowl of white rice  
Dinnertime it's a saltless potato  
I ain't allowed no spice  
If this diet's gonna work  
Tonight I can't eat no more  
""Just go to sleep,"" I say to myself  
As I close the bedroom door  
Two in the morning, I wake up to piss  
My belly's hungry and achin'  
Tiptoe to the kitchen, fuck the diet  
Bring on the chips flavored with bacon  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Make a tub o' shit outta me

Do the hustle with seven-footer Billy Russell  
Do the fucking hustle, jerking your love muscle  
Shake your big, round ass with the ghost of Mama Cass  
Blast from the past, the ghost of Mama Cass  
Dry-hump the floor with Mary Tyler-Moore  
Pump it sore  
Squeeze your nipple like baldy Mr. Whipple  
Drink some Ripple  
Give it a hearty whack with TV great Victor Tayback  
When you give it a whack, don't hurt the nut-sack

You gotta stop playing with your noodle

And then pretend that you really didn't mind

To get real plump, read tomatoes  
Oh, and one more thing  
My hobby is moyda  
Two, three, four  
I'm a sick man  
My hobby is moyda  
My hobby is moyda  
I'll eat a hamboyga  
Then commit moyda  
  
I never loiter  
After committing the doity deed of moyda  
Only Sigmund Freuda  
Knows why I cannot and will not stop committing moyda  
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder

Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,  
So why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,  
I told him I was sorry,  
I'm a liar,  
So no toys for me... I don't deserve them.  
  
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,  
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.  
  
Dear santa,  
  
I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.  
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and  
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes  
Me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because  
I love you santa.

I have finally made my score  
I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast  
But she loves me the most  
  
Even though she's a highly paid whore  
She'll give head to a sheep  
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek  
But she comes home to me  
  
She'll do the groom and the best man  
She'll slap your ass in the back of a van  
But she comes home to me  
She could fuck nine guys in a row  
  
But still have a tenth for me  
And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips  
Unless you pay an extra fifty  
So mister, don't you fall in love  
  
'Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove  
Since her heart belongs to me  
She has a throat that just won't quit  
She can take all of it  
  
And still have room for your balls  
But she shops in the malls for me  
She'll say twelve then call back and say one  
But I don't care I know it's just work not fun  
  
When she blows you, Jack  
Don't you think she's not thinking of me  
She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack  
But strictly for the cash  
  
And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee  
to watch her put a water bottle in her gash  
(Put a water bottle in her gash)  
She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'  
  
But don't you dare try to go antique-ing  
'Cause she does that with me  
Her pussy's sweet as honey  
But when she moans, it's just for the money  
  
Unless she's sittin' on me  
She'll cram your asshole with a mouse  
But she won't do it in our house  
Tough luck, Jack  
  
She knows that don't fly with me  
She might eat your wife's box  
But she won't tell ya where you left your socks  
She rolled up and down your fat prick  
  
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick  
She's got a face full of nuts  
And a mouth full of cocks  
She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,  
  
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game  
But they never got to know her actual name  
On your face she will piss  
On your chest she might poop  
  
But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup  
That's simply reserved..  
Oh she'll bite ya, she'll spank ya  
But she'll never thank you for free  
  
'Cause baby... comes home to me.

Be back at quarter to four""  
""Don't slam your pinkies in the drawer""  
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore  
Hanging out at Studio 54  
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor  
With Lionel Richie  
Who, by the way, was a Commodore  
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar  
Who couldn't breat right since the Vietnam War

And went camping with Eva Gabor

Wearing a bikini made of purple velour  
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour  
With the smile of Guy Lefleur  
She got the ups and downs like an elevator  
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore  
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor  
Either or, Neithor nor  
She'll share it with your Labrador  
She can run faster than a blazing meteor  
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore  
Can make a pipe out of an apple core  
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish  
Down in Ecuador  
You know why?  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she's coming home  
Well, for sure she opened the door  
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure  
Sexually, that made me insecure  
Like the time I was a roadie  
On Elton John's tour  
She said, ""Let's go catch some Piscatore!""  
I said, ""Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more.""  
She said, ""By God, you're right!""  
So we took ourselves a snore  
And when we woke up 10 hours later  
We made Love Du Jour  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she came home  
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then  
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag  
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie  
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel  
She gonna try on my third grade mittens  
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small  
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me  
She ain't never gonna let me down  
She ain't never gonna tell nobody  
I'm afraid of birds and spiders  
Well, Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice

After using the frigerator

Won't someone retreive my wig, wig, wig  
  
I got no right to growl  
Watch out, she's on the prowl  
Without my wig, I look like an owl

Something jumped and poked me good  
'That' he said 'just me morning wood'  
A little tin soldier's marchin by  
Sergeant major unzips his fly  
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants  
Slaps away til it starts to dance  
A shootin star's above my bed  
Changin colors of my mushroom head  
A rainbow jizz flys across the room  
Little white spermies meet their doom

And my scrotum sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Little green men from outer space  
Here to exterminate the human race  
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships  
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip  
Like a knight of olden Camelot  
The goo takes off like an arrow shot  
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs  
For the spittin dragon between me legs  
I'm using my thing for what it's for  
Gentle knock upon me door  
Mumsy drops her cup of tea  
When she sees my wank standing tall and free

But he ain't got no dick no more  
Comes home smokin from the corner pub  
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub  
The world spins around like a big bass drum  
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum  
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl  
Time to clean up with the washroom towel

So here comes number three!  
  
Ross and Phoebe from Friends  
Say the Chanukah blessing,  
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing!  
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mixed meat with dairy,  
Maybe they should have called that show  
Little Kosher House on the Prairie!  
We got Jerry Lewis,  
Ben Stiller, and Jack Black,  
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism,  
But you guys can have him back!

Underneath the mistletoe,

Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets  
With such precision,  
But one thing they could not get out of...  
Their painful circumcision!  
Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish,  
But a full-time Oscar winner,  
Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish too,  
And I'd like to put more in her! Whoo!

Beck, and Paula Abdul,  
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music,  
But first came Hebrew school!

It's time to celebrate Chanukah,  
I hope I get an Abtronica  
On this joyful, joyful Chanukah,

Adam Sandler,The Lonesome Kicker,/a/adam+sandler/the+lonesome+kicker_20003956.html,"Me, I'm the Lonesome Kicker  
Extra points, field goals at your service  
One might think it comes with glory  
You might think different after you listen to my story  
  
My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask  
What it possibly could protect, I do not know  
The other guys on the team  
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads  
And also like to hide the special shoe  
I need to kick in the snow  
  
People think it's so easy  
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line  
They forget to add seven yards for the snap  
And 10 more 'cause the goal posts are pushed way back  
  
In 1974, the uprights were right on the goal line  
But some of the players were running into them  
And getting hurt  
So screw the kicker  
Who cares about the kicker?  
  
But I kick that ball  
And I pray it goes straight  
If it does  
The coach says ""Good job, number 8""  
He doesn't even know my name is  
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski, Jr.  
But that's the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kickoffs can be so very scary  
Especially, if the returner breaks on through  
And I'm the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him  
I don't want to get hurt  
So I pretend to tie my shoe  
  
Once again, I'm ignored by my teammates and all my coaches  
""Go back where you came from!""  
Scream 70,000 fans  
Well, I know I could win their love back  
By catching a winning touch-down  
But, unfortunately, I was born with these very small hands  
  
And I hope that the cameras don't come in too close  
'Cause they might see the tears in my eyes  
As I sit on this bench made of cold-hearted wood  
And the splinters go deep in my thighs  
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Another blocked kick  
And everybody blames me  
But it was the Left Guard  
Who didn't pick up his man  
Oh, why can't they see...  
  
In my home country  
I could have been a minor league soccer player  
But I came to America  
Seeking fortune and seeking fame  
I didn't realize that if I shanked one  
And blew the point spread  
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi  
After the game  
  
So I go home at night  
'Cause I never get invited  
To go drinking with the other guys  
And I sit in my chair, and I soak my foot  
As I eat a plate of cold french fries  
And my wife's out with her quote-unquote friend  
And my son can't look me in the eyes  
But that's the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kicking for you  
They took my snow shoe  
They're going for two

Cause he's a very, very pious mule  
When he sees a picture of a carrot he has a tendency to druel  
On Halloween he tries to scare me by dressing up as a ghoul  
He once challenged someone who stole my hat to a duel  
Cause he's a very, very Old school mule  
A needle-nosed plier is his favorite tool  
He lifeguards on a volunteer basis and the Rec. Center pool  
When I break down on the side of the road he shows up with unleaded fuel  
He's a devoted fan of Ms. Paula Abdul  
And also approves of the recent makeover of former folkie Jewel

Let's eat the turkey  
In my big brown shoe  
Love to eat the turkey  
At the table  
I once saw a movie  
With Betty Grable  
Eat that turkey  
All night long  
Fifty million Elvis fans  
Can't be wrong  
Turkey lurkey doo and  
Turkey lurkey dap  
I eat that turkey  
Then I take a nap  
  
Thanksgiving is a special night

Turkey with gravy and cranberry  
Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry  
Turkey for you and  
Turkey for me  
Can't believe Tyson  
Gave that girl V.D.  
  
White meat, dark meat  
You just can't lose  
I fell off my moped  
And I got a bruise  
Turkey in the oven  
And the buns in the toaster  
I'll never take down  
My Cheryl Tiegs poster  
Wrap the turkey up  
In aluminum foil  
My brother likes to masturbate  
With baby oil  
Turkey and sweet potato pie  
Sammy Davis Jr.  
Only had one eye  
  
Turkey for the girls and  
Turkey for the boys  
My favorite kind of pants  
Are corduroys  
Gobble gobble goo and  
Gobble gobble gickel  
I wish turkey  
Only cost a nickel  
Oh I love turkey on Thanksgiving

But now I'm only happy when I'm drinking J.D.

And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly

I only did the things that Momma said I should  
But now I just do whatever I want

She caught me red handed  
And said we're through

It keeps growing in the same place  
I can't reach it with my left or right hand

It's four days old  
And it hurts so bad  
But it's ready for a squeeze  
Won't somebody pop it for me please?

And you're looking for a guy  
I'll never cheat again, I promise

I'm trying to tell you just how  
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally  
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  
But you'd save the best for last  
Like I'm the one for you  
  
You should know that you're just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest  
It turns out it ain't enough  
You're still not mentioning love  
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?  
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere  
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her  
And I think that I know things may never change  
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say  
  
I make you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more

But, despite the truth that I know  
I find it hard to let go and give up on you  
Seems I love the things you do  
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am  
To persist with this heartbreak and running around  
And I will do until I'm finding myself you  
  
And make you feel a way you've never felt before  
And be all you need so that you never want more  
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue  
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

I won't rise until this battle's won  
My dignity is become undone  
  
But I won't go  
I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,  
If this is ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,  
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined  
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying  
I heard his voice today  
I didn't know a single word he said  
Not one resemblance to the man I met  
Just a vacant broken boy instead  
  
But I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
There will be times, we'll try and give it up  
Bursting at the seams, no doubt  
We almost fall apart and burn to pieces  
So watch them turn to dust  
But nothing will never taint us  
  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
Will he, will he still remember me?  
Will he still love me even when he's free  
Or will he go back to the place where  
He will choose the poison over me?  
When we spoke yesterday  
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait  
I'll be home soon, I won't be late  
  
He won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
He's willing to take the risk  
So I won't go, He can't do it on his own,  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
'Cause he won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
We're willing to take the risk  
I won't go! I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk

Adele,Hiding My Heart,/a/adele/hiding+my+heart_20913875.html,"This is how the story went  
I met someone by accident  
It blew me away  
It blew me away  
  
It was in the darkest of my days  
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  
And buried them away, you buried them away  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
Drop you off at the train station  
Put a kiss on top of your head  
Watch you wave  
Watched you wave  
  
Then I went on home to your skyscrapers  
Neon lights and waiting papers  
That you call home  
I call it home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
I woke up feeling heavy hearted  
I'm going back to where I started  
The morning rain, the morning rain  
Although I wish that you were here  
That same old road that brought me here  
Is calling me home, It's calling me home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
And I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Ticking by your call,

And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees  
At the first sight of you crawling back to me  
To whisper ""will you leave your man? ""

You hold me alright

Didn't show emotions, don't know why  
Didn't wanna feel the pain inside, I guess

I should leave the past behind me,  
I should let you find me,  
Supposed to stay beside me  
You were supposed to guide me,  
Through the ups and downs,  
You were always gonna be around until the end  
  
I still think we could  
'Cause you and me, we're good  
And I'll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I'm sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
So I'm gonna get myself another drink  
Whenever I start to think about you  
'Cause I do what I really don't want to  
But sometimes my dreams just come through  
  
And when I get there,  
To a place where I see you in a kitchen  
I stop wishing but that thing and I don't need you,  
I don't really wanna see youAnd I don't want you to see me,  
You would think that I was crazy,  
You might think that I wanna be close to you  
But I'd rather wanna drink some Whisky  
And maybe have a little sip 'o wine

I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be  
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe  
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life  
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be  
Every story has its scars

When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy

Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through

And I will always love you  
Love you, love you

And even then you don't get far

Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

I can't go back to the river

It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance  
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river

It was dark and I was over  
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me  
  
My hands, they're strong  
But my knees were far too weak  
To stand in your arms  
Without falling to your feet  
  
But there's a side to you  
That I never knew, never knew  
All the things you'd say  
They were never true, never true  
And the games you play  
You would always win, always win

Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well, it burned while I cried  
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,  
Your name  
  
When I lay with you  
I could stay there  
Close my eyes  
Feel you here forever  
You and me together nothing gets better  
  
'Cause there's a side to you  
That I never knew, never knew  
All the things you'd say

Well, it felt something died  
'Cause I knew that that was  
The last time, the last time  
  
Sometimes I wake up by the door,  
That heart you caught must be waiting for you  
Even now when we're already over  
I can't help myself from looking for you

Pissed off and alone  
Yeah, it's all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes  
Yeah, what's it take to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
I believe I've always been in love with you  
Though we got caught up in the sway  
Never know in where we left  
Been off the hook and out of hand  
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime  
'Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time  
  
You call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Yeah, it's all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes  
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye

Aerosmith,Avant Garden,/a/aerosmith/avant+garden_20004299.html,"I had a friend who spoke of fate  
And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon  
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so  
Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause love's what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'  
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin'  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'  
But dreams just ain't enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just ain't right  
To deal with other's shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Don't never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you don't even have to try  
So I'll be waiting in your garden  
Ffff...watching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
You'll know we've arrived  
Here inside our avant garden...yeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
There's sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant garden...ooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it...  
You can spend your whole lifetime  
Under my skin  
You can be never more mine  
Under my skin
