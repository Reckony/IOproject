HIM,Bleed Well,/h/him/bleed+well_20447393.html,"You had demons to kill within you screaming  
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes  
  
Love preys the living and praises the dead  
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed  
  
Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged  
Kiss and tell, baby we're bleeding well  
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane  
Kill and tell, baby we're bleeding well'  
'In hell  
  
'No love lost under her will', I heard you weeping  
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in  
  
If death is the answer to love's mysteries  
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream

From the dust where into his body has been  
Incinerated incinerated incinerated

The curtains flew then he appeared  
Saying don't be afraid  
  
Come on baby,and we had no fear  
And we ran to him, and we started to fly

Finding souls to feed  
The night side of Eden  
We see the struggling  
For her love's  
Last breath and walk off

Killing ourselves a kiss at a time

Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
She's blinded by the fear  
Of life and death and everything in between  
We smile when she cries a river of tears  
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away

Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile

We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more,  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life.  
  
I've seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought,  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrow's trembling at the sight of you and I.

To take the sleep that you don't know

Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality  
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin

The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep  
We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again

Why time would've passed us by  
  
With every step I take  
The less I know myself  
And every vow I break on my way towards your heart  
Countless times I've prayed  
For forgiveness  
But Gods just laughed at my face  
And this path remains  
Leading me into solitude arms  
  
I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But I'll carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn  
  
Amidst all the tears there's a smile  
That all angels will greet with an envious song  
One look into strangers eyes  
And I know where I belong  
  
I walk through the gardens  
Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time would've passed us by  
  
Oh I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But I'll carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn

Heard a mockingbird sing  
Was he laughing at me?  
I went to the basin  
Washed the sleep out my eyes  
So I could see  
A note on the bed  
Close to where my lover should be  
She slipped away in the night  
The writing was shaky  
And with tears on the sheets  
I'm sorry we had a fight  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
I'm sorry we never said goodbye  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
Left with a tear in your eye  
Must've been brewing for a very long time  
In the wardrobe the hangers are bare  
Don't know how you did it  
It must've been planned  
You even took your favorite chair  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye  
You won't find no tear in my eye  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye

Found myself at Charlie's scene  
Drinking all fashions  
Sticky painted movie queen  
Winked her eye at me  
That's how it happened  
Diamond shoes, satin dress  
Flashin', flashin', flashin', flashin'  
Woke up in the morning  
Heard my mockingbird sing  
And it was singin' for me

Here by my side  
She's good company  
Well, hello sweet lady, hello  
Good morning with a smile

Hollies,Let Her Go Down,/h/hollies/let+her+go+down_20244672.html,"Sometime in October  
We sailed from England's shore  
When we sailed into a raging storm  
Like I never ever seen before  
And all of the crew they were brave men  
But the captain he was braver  
And he said  
""Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her""  
  
Let her go down Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
  
Lost in the open ocean  
There was some of the crew and me  
While the captain steered our wounded ship  
To the bottom of an angry sea  
And with his dying breath  
We all heard him say  
""It's just the fortune of sailor""  
And he said  
""Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her""  
  
Chorus  
  
He wondered if his shipmates  
Were ready to just pray and give in  
So he called their names out one by one  
But there was no one else around but him  
He saw the ship go down the fading light  
And he knew that they could have saved her  
He said  
""The captain lied when the captain cried  
'There's none of us here can save her' ""  
  
Chorus  
  
Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
Swim for your lives

We're not nice.

At an Aztec temples opening day,  
We priest would please the gods this way.  
Hoards of enemies we'd slay,  
Mass sacrifice.

To win at war, make crops grow more,  
To cure our kids when ill.  
The sun to shine, this song to rhyme,  
More victims we must kill.

Our year starts in november, when every priestly member,  
Is asked if they'll remember, our Aztec dead.  
We do this if you haven't guessed, by getting something off your chest,  
Your heart would proberbly be best, or else your head.  
And then on our year planners, it's the raising of the banners,  
And it's only polite manners, to kill more guys.

December and January, desmembering methods vary,  
All you need to know, is that we pill them high.  
May and June, it's summer time, the killing is easy,  
It's only halfway through the year, bet you're feeling queasy.  
In autumn time, we sweep our home and kill some more but then,  
By late October, the killings over, then it starts up again!

Once fell off my horse and hurt my self,

To see how corpses work?  
Well it's always a palaver  
Getting hold of a cadaver  
So I said yes I'll ahve her

[Verse 3]  
Spaniels I adored  
Named after me too  
Like me, they were fun  
With a nutty hair do!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Is today my birthday?  
I can't recall  
Let's have a party anyway  
Because I love a masked ball!  
  
[Chorus]  
All hail, the king!  
Of bling! Let's sing!  
Bells ring! Ding ding!  
I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 5]  
King Charles, my daddy  
Lost his throne  
And kings were banned  
They chopped off his head  
Then Olly Cromwell ruled the land  
  
[Verse 6]  
Old Olly wasn't jolly  
He was glum, and he was proud  
Would be miserable as sin  
Only sinning's not allowed!  
  
[Verse 7]  
When Olly died, the people said  
'Charlie, me hearty!  
Get rid of his dull laws  
Come back, we'd rather party!  
  
[Verse 8]  
This action's what they called  
The monarchy restoration  
Which naturally was followed  
By a huge celebration!  
  
[Chorus]  
The King of Eng! (Land say!)  
No sin! Too sing! (Okay!)  
Or anything!  
All say, I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 9]  
Great London Fire was a whopper!  
In my reign, London city came a-cropper!  
So this king did what was right and proper  
Fought the fire, proved I'm more than a bopper  
I'm a fire stopper!  
  
[Verse 10]  
Married Catherine Braganza  
She was a love so true  
There would never be another  
Well... Maybe one or two!  
  
[Verse 11]  
Lucy Walter Nell Gwynne  
Moll Davies Barbara Villiers  
You think that's bad  
But her name's not as silly as  
Hortense Mancini!  
  
[Verse 12]  
As king, I must admit  
I broke the wedding rules  
But who cares when I brought back  
The crown jewels?  
I reinstated Christmas  
Make up, sports and even plays  
I was the merry monarch  
They were good old days!  
  
[Chorus]  
When said and done!  
King Charles did run!  
England for fun!  
I was the king loved by everyone  
My song is done!

Party anyone?

I am a pharoah  
Yet they're-o meant to be guys  
But I don't care-o

Thought that they should rule too

Oh dear, they both died!  
I wonder who that would leave  
Little me-o, pharoah Cleo?  
Okay, no time to grieve!

But it gets worse  
Married my half brother  
And we ruled the universe

Led to an overcrowded throne

Then I dressed like goddess Isis  
Long, black hair in ringlets nicest  
Viper's tooth for men entices  
Finest linen robe, top prices!

Married another brother  
He's an okay geezer  
But never told  
Of my love for Julius Caesar

That he'd be crowned king  
My bro said no, I said 'Oh! '  
And I murdered him

A man who takes my fancy like

Of Dick Turpin's highway glory

You think life is one big antic  
My profession is romantic

But it ain't  
  
HA  
  
As a butcher down in Essex I was handy with a knife  
Had a sideline as a poacher led a less than honest life  
  
The notorious gang of Gregory  
Liked my style and dedication  
They signed me up and gave me  
A real robber's education  
  
We rampaged through the Essex farms  
We stole and robbed and fought  
But when the law came for us  
I escaped and they got caught  
  
I became I highway man  
Was daylight robbery

I was no prince charming  
Nothing dandy about me

The truth is, I was violent  
And with my good mate, Matt King  
Robbed travelers at gunpoint  
Money, watches, anything!  
  
My horse wasn't called Black Bess  
Although that's what you've read  
Was no romantic hero  
Shot not one but two men dead  
  
The legend that surrounds me  
Misses out the crucial part  
I was a ruthless killer  
With a ruthless killer's heart!  
  
Was a vicious highwayman  
A source of pain and tears  
  
HA  
  
When you hear how my story ends  
You won't believe your ears

I ran away to Yorkshire  
Changed my name to John Palmer  
Was sent to prison  
After stealing chickens from a farmer  
  
Wrote a letter to my family  
A plea it did relate  
The postman saw the envelope  
And here's the twist of fate  
  
He had taught me how to write  
So he'd knew I'd lied  
""that's not John Palmer's hand!  
That's Dick Turpin's!"" he cried!  
  
Was a vicious highway man  
My crimes had brought me fame  
  
HA  
  
Was stitched up by a postie  
That's not glamorous  
THAT'S LAME!

White is beautiful dear ladies, smear your face with paint of lead,  
Never mind the lead had made the men who mixed it I'll or dead.  
  
Take some silk of red or black, cut a circle or a cresent,  
Stick it on your face to cover, smallpox scars, it's much more pleasant.  
  
Shave your eyebrows, clean away, take a trap and catch some mice,  
Make false eyebrows with the mouse skin, stick them on, you'll look so  
Nice.  
  
Next you need a monster wig, if you want to look real smashing,  
Once your wig has reached the roof, then you'll be the height of fashion.  
  
Decorate your lovely hairpiece, use the feathers of a parrot,  
Add some ribbon, fruit and flowers, from your ear then hang a carrot.  
  
Make your face look soft and chubby, pack your mouth with balls of cork,  
Hang your flash teeth in the middle, hope you don't choke when you talk.  
  
Now you followed my advice, last of all you need a fan,  
Flutter it oh so demurely, then your sure to bag your man.

I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We fight by day, and when it's not so bright  
We're not so bright!  
  
[Verse 1]  
We like to beat, and chop and stab our wicked enemy  
But all the time we try to stick to rules of chivalry  
Rule one, we have to do brave deeds for some great lady fair  
I'd write poems, I would joust, and I would fight a bear  
(Well, maybe a teddy bear. Oh, I can't! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We charge ahead, but never left or right  
We're never right!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rule two, we have to practise in the noble art of war  
Battle for our king and country, that's what knights are for  
And if there is no war to fight, a-hunting we will go  
We hunt for deer and rabbits too, so long as they are slow  
(Otherwise we can't catch them! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We are fighters and our armour's always tight  
And these swords aren't light!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Rule three, in war we aim to capture other knights alive  
Their families pay us lots of dosh so long as they survive  
We act like gentlemen, and only fight with other gents  
A real knight, he would never fight against peasants!  
(Anyway, peasants pong! Eurgh! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight

Wanted people to say I was brave,  
But I lost my first fight and hid in a cave.  
Living there could be a pauper's nightmare,  
But if you're rich like me then you don't care.  
I called my slave to the cave to ask it,  
To cook a feast and lower in a basket.  
  
Those Romans think they're minted,  
But they aint rich like me.  
You can't call yourself loaded,  
Till you can buy an army.  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,  
They're more famous than me.  
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,  
There's no-one richer than me.  
I'm minted!  
  
I back General Sulla,  
Everyday my wallet got fuller.  
Took the land off enemies to flog it,  
Used the cash to fill my pocket.  
If I heard of a house on fire,  
I'd rush over and be a quick cash buyer.  
My fireman would then douse the flames, boom!  
Another big house to my name.  
  
Those Romans think they're minted,

I'm minted!  
  
I bought an army for fighting Spartacus,  
At the start my men lost heart-acus.  
I killed on in ten in a killing spree,  
So they were more scared of me than the enemy.  
Smashed the slaves, it got real gory,  
But then Pompey stole my glory.  
To show it was me that crushed the horde,  
Nailed up the slaves like on a billboard.  
They're splinted!  
  
Not enough to be a politician,  
Wanted triumph, took my army on a mission.  
Got owned by the Parthian Persians,  
They killed me, but you'll hear two versions.  
The famous one's quite hard to follow,  
They gave me boiling gold to swallow.  
But the true way they made me pay,  
They used my head as a prop in a play!  
Embarrasing!

We had a hundred years of war. This girl had to do something!  
So I did it like a dude, cut my hair.  
Gave up wearing dresses, bought a pair.  
Of trousers, no blouses. Said I wanna fight Angleterre.  
  
Charles let me join the army, army, army.  
Know that might sound barmy, barmy, barmy.  
I proved impressive,  
Hit by an arrow a-a-and lived.

Defeated them at Patay, Patay, Patay.  
We saved Orle-eans and Charles was crowned tres bon!

But I was a lucky mascot.  
Inspired soldiers with brav-er-y.  
Fought injured and sur-vived.  
  
But in 1430, Burgundians captured me!  
King Charles couldn't pay my ransom.  
No-one told me, why!  
  
Being prisoner was not my style, tried escaping from my capture's vile.  
But then the English who fought me, bought me! Made me stand, trial!

You're just jealous cos God speaks ter me.  
Say you speak to saints? In this discourse? What language do they speak?  
French o'course.  
Pah! Now you're in prison, they have failed yer.  
I say it's God's plan that you're my jailer.  
Here's a trick question in that case. Do you think you're in God's grace... ?  
  
If I am not, may God put me there, and if I am, may God so keep me.  
  
Oh your smart remarks go round the houses.  
You're guilty of heresy.(and wearing men's trousers)  
  
Despite my testimony, mony, mony.  
Condemned for reasons phony, phony, phony.  
But my will did no-ot break.

Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasn't pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didn't have to.  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead

'Bout King Richard the third  
  
My brother Edward, died  
His kids too young to rule  
So... I took the throne  
Why not? I'm nobody's fool!  
  
Thomas More wrote a history  
Said I'd murdered Edward's boys  
Shakespeare said their death  
Was an evil ploy  
But I say those two  
Are historical vandals!  
They've ruined my image!  
I mean, what a scandal!  
  
Never bumped off  
Those harmless young heirs  
Never buried them  
Under the Tower of London stairs  
Never poisoned my wife  
Bumped off her daddy  
This is me, sweet Richard  
Do I look like a baddy?  
Never was two-faced  
Sure you'll agree  
I was misunderstood  
King Richard three  
  
Can you imagine it?  
I'm the last Plantagenet  
Beaten by Henry  
In the Wars of the Roses  
The Tudor dynasty  
Didn't care that much for me  
Now I'm painted as a baddy  
That's why one supposes... (continues while next verse is sang)  
  
Never forget  
When you hear of my crimes  
Never drowned my brother  
In a massive vat of wine  
Never said 'a horse!  
My kingdom for a horse! '  
Who made that up?  
Why, William Shakespeare, of course!  
  
Now my tale is told  
You won't hear a bad word  
About a special ruler  
King Richard the third  
Arg it's a wasp it's a wasp

The weedy kids were left to die  
As breakfast for the birds

We're taught not to be meek

Three square meals every week

I'm the boss that's understood  
I smack them if they're naughty  
And I thwack them if they're good  
I'm feeling rather peckish  
I'm gonna steal some food  
Caught! I'll have to punish you  
Ungrateful Spartan brood  
  
We promise not to steal  
We're not the thieving sort  
Stealing is considered good  
What's bad is getting caught

Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School  
  
We have a bunch of contests  
To see who is the best  
The leanest, meanest,  
Roughest, toughest Spartan contest

And it's Spartan graduation  
Straight away we go to work  
No time for celebration  
Ten years active service  
In the army  
No diversion  
There's only one job for a Spartan  
Killing lot's of Persians!  
  
Wondering about love?  
It's banned until you're thirty  
High School doesn't teach romance  
It teaches fighting dirty

For two and a half million years.  
But there's more of Stone Age to engage,  
Than maybe it first appears.  
  
Dinosaurs, Neanderthals,  
Let's make this clearer.  
Didn't live together,  
Came from different eras.  
That's not all I can tell you,  
So much more to be known.  
About the many phases,  
In the ages of stone.  
  
Shooby-dooby-doo-wap  
  
It's all the rage.

Brush up on your Stone Age.  
  
Oh yeah! All right!  
  
It's fine to define,  
An era Palaeolithic.  
But you're gonna have to be,  
A little more specific.  
Do you mean lower,  
When ancient beings first used tools?  
Or middle Palaeolithic,  
When Neanderthal ruled?  
  
That's when Homo sapiens,  
Starts to emerge.  
But just in Africa,  
It's long before the global surge.  
Not till upper Palaeolithic,  
Forty thousand years ago.  
Did Neanderthal and Homo sapiens say hello,  
Neanderthal and Homo sapi,  
Living in caveman harmony.  
  
Language was invented,  
Cave painting art.  
Then Palaeolithic ended,  
Which meant the start.  
Of phase two-be-doo-be-doo-wap  
  
Turn a new page.  
  
Skiddly-bap-doo-wah  
  
Buck up on the Stone Age.  
  
Oh yeah! All right!  
  
This is where it starts to,  
Get all scientific.  
Palaeolithic's followed by,  
The era Mesolithic.  
Then Neanderthals are wiped out,  
By the ice age - horrific!  
After which the Neolithic age,  
Was terrific.  
  
Man learned to farm,  
Built homes so they could settle.  
Then some other folks turned up,  
And they discovered metal.  
Beaker men from Europe,  
Found bronze and outgrown.  
The simple and traditional ways of stone.  
  
Bronze Age was invented,  
By now man was flying.  
'Cause hot on it's heels,  
Came the age of iron.  
Celts, Druids,  
Religion then Rome.  
By now a distant memory,  
Those ages of stone.  
  
Shooby-dooby-doo-wap  
  
Since that metallic stage.  
  
Skiddly-bap-doo-wah  
  
There was no more Stone Age.

A period notorious  
So many brand new goods we did create.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Our list is long and glorious,  
Though I don't intend to borious  
Was a time of great invention  
  
Was it really? What did we invent then?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well I'm just about to mention,  
Drum roll please lets raise the tension  
We invented this. Music hall.  
  
Is that all?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Well...  
A chap called Henry Bessemer invented molten steel  
Which led to other chaps creating the automobile  
Which let to petrol, tires and bikes so all that was required  
Was roads so concrete came and tarmac thought up to  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your hired!  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooooh. Concrete, tarmac, steel.  
The automobile  
Seal of rubber wheel  
Such inventive zeal  
Still there's plenty to reveal.  
  
[Verse 5]  
Victorian brains worked over time to come up with ideas.  
We invented lights bulbs.  
Nice one!  
Cheers!

Type writers and radios, now news was fast conveyed. Hello?  
A telephone was no good till a second phone was made. Hello!

Our inventors did not snooze,  
Always had another rouse.  
The latest flushing loo  
Films that did amuse.  
Flashbulb cameras to use.

Easter eggs and rockets, we invented the whole lot.  
  
Ooo... !  
  
Hang on there's more  
  
[Chorus]  
Trains and lines and bridges and the underground as well.  
Paddle steamers prams and disinfectant for their smell  
Sterile doctors instruments, one last unmentioned brand.  
Victorians invented the worlds first conveyor band.  
  
[Bridge]  
Cuddly toy?  
Invented 1902. The year after Victoria died.

Oooohhh, barometers were new  
Iron ships a coo  
What genius!

From our birth we were given an identity  
People told us we were great or small  
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong  
Not forgetting the bullies at school

And as the world makes us feel great  
And as the world makes us feel small  
Oh so convinced of our identity  
If we only knew it we just can't believe it we just won't believe it  
  
Leading us to think that we are such a success  
Conning us to think that we are just a failure  
Leading us to think that we are so intelligent  
Conning us to think that we are just a do-do do-do

He said don't be afraid I've come to know I've come to make my mark  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
He said why are these men and women lying here just on the street  
He said why are these children dying 'cause' they have no food to eat  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
Why are these people hating others for the colour of their skin  
Why are your brother creatures murdered for the flesh that lies within  
Don't lose the rage, don't become immune  
When others criticise you  
Don't change your tune  
You've got to love, with a passion that hurts  
It's love that conquers baby  
Its love that serves  
And in the moment before you go to sleep  
You can turn on me I'm the blue light wrap me round you  
And when the world turns it's coldest shoulder  
In the name of all that's good  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
And I'll be there, to dry your tears  
And I'll be cooking in your kitchen  
Food for everyone  
And ill be working in the backroom

Youthful dreams  
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems  
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes  
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise  
Chorus  
When you cross that line, there's no turning back  
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door  
Everyone has got to take some responsibility  
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me  
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair  
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare  
I'm telling you when I say these words, that  
They're not spoken in bitterness  
That destructive emotion has long ago left  
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me  
Start afresh  
When you cross that line, what more can I say  
When you cross that line, we are no more  
We are no more

Going to sow before I reap

Cynics try to hold me in the graveyard of their egos  
Put my dreams out with the trashman and they left me on a plateau  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are walking on a tightrope  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are wilted down to your last last hope  
See it through to a conclusion even if it leads to nowhere  
Sometimes there is no solution but the water tastes as good there

And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't look at the rain  
  
Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery

Hearing this sham is like getting drunk on cheap wine  
  
Well it's time for a change  
I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong  
  
Look in better places gonna look inside  
Gonna get higher something is pulling me on  
Breaking down the old ways feeling no regret  
Gone are the shaky sands I've been building on  
  
Well it's time for a change  
Well I've lost lots of friends  
I've got to move on  
By sticking to my ground  
There's got to be more than this  
I don't give a damn  
The feeling is strong  
Just look what I've found  
  
Here I come now got no time to frown  
Nothing in my way now nothing can bring me down  
Feel that surge open the doors around  
Higher and higher the world is my hunting ground  
  
Well it's time for a change  
I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong

In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy

It's dangerous and a bit risky  
But what about the view  
See the clouds and the mountains too

Get your hands dirty  
Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain

So much love to give and take  
Many dreams and plans to make  
Can't believe it we knew you so well  
  
Hardly bare to think what you went through  
As your feet fell through the air  
Hanging in a void of hopeless darkness  
Way beyond despair  
But you made us doubt  
We would've heard your cry  
Of desolation  
We went there as well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well  
  
Rippling through a generation  
Aftershocks for years to come  
The angry final step is taken  
Never to be undone  
On the other side  
Was a wave to ride  
Through the storm cloud  
To bring you to shore

One glance from your direction and the government will fall

If we miss the morning meeting our lives will be in danger  
Someone's trying to stop us, there is someone in our party  
It is someone with a grudge and they won't let us reach the border  
  
Our lives are in his hands, we pay with Krugerrands  
The currency of pain to help us leaving  
While back in our homeland the ones who make a stand  
Are taken from their homes and no one hears of them again  
  
I felt I had to come here, I thought things would be better  
The situation's changed but I find I'm still resented  
Someone wants my job it is someone in this building  
Someone's spreading rumors and I don't feel I can stay here  
  
I think I'm going north and now's the time to leave  
The people there they say are good to strangers  
And if I do my best and try to settle in  
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor

Decisions to be made  
The good advice of friends unheeded  
The best of plans mislaid  
Just looking for a new direction  
In an old familiar way  
The forming of a new connection  
To study or to play

Faithful. no reason why. in my mind at this time. just clear  
Blue sky. your story just starting. now learn to fly.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
No time now for sorrow. meet life full-blast. let?s take on  
Tomorrow. forget the past.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
This is what you came here for. stop the engine slam the  
Door. leave that lonesome corridor.  
Take the plunge and wipe the slate. smile your smile -  
you're feeling great. soon you're going to celebrate.  
Time has gone to hesitate. nothing now can make you  
Wait. take control of your own fate.  
Take tomorrow in your hand. make the others understand.  
One break you must demand.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.

You're half awake with one arm in your coat  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you

You sit down on the floor  
And you're asleep before you are alone

You run to meet the bills  
No one's awake to tell you

For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided  
The day is over and the moon is high  
But your period of work is predecided  
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldn't make it on your own  
He helps you in the door  
You sit down as before  
Another shift to pay another loan

Oh how I hate the celebration  
But you give it all away leaving me on my own

Floating through the open window. To the cool inside.  
Where we lay side by side. How can anything we feel. Ever

need. Ever get in touch. With the meaning of.  
A whole life waiting? Wishing suddenly. That it's going to be  
the real thing. Or separating. Try your luck again. It's just  
part of the adventure.  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. ""The Soundtrack to a

Soundtrack to a Generation"".  
Another tune. Before the light has gone. And we'll be on  
our way. The sounds and smells. Will always linger on.  
They're in my heart today.  
We feel so lucky then. The world's a massive place. But we  
run into each other. Just one small happening. An accident  
of fate. Or the work of co-conspirators? But if we knew.  
What could it do. To help us now?  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. ""The Soundtrack to a  
Generation"". Anyhow. Just give it to me now. ""The  
Soundtrack to a Generation"". Oh Wow. You really got me

now.

Cagney is the news  
Does the giant ring a bell  
Boy it's the Hudson East river cruise  
It's the Empire State buffoons  
Oh you know the story well  
  
Do you have to run  
Do you have to hide  
There's a new tomorrow  
Yes you're a mess  
But you're more than less  
When this battles won  
You can look inside  
Oh you did not borrow  
Yes you're the best  
But you still can't rest  
You know, you know  
  
The carnival is closed  
Your street's alive with ghosts  
But a friend says don't look back  
Don't look back, don't look round  
Your vision is your fate  
Through long electric nights  
When a woman helps you write  
Na na na, na na na  
Na  
Na na na, na na na  
  
Cheer up mate, put the dramas in the past  
See you did not have to fast  
Euphemism lasts and lasts and lasts  
And lasts, and lasts, and lasts  
And lasts, and lasts  
Boy if you've got an axe to grind  
Be thankful for this time  
For it gives you what you need  
Boy you've got an eighty-eight to play  
It'll tell you what to say  
It'll tell you when to breathe  
  
Boy take a turnpike heading West  
Turn the people on to Beau Geste  
'Cause that's what you did the best  
Boy play the pipes 'til they're old and worn  
Sing the words 'til they fall forlorn  
Like the pieces of a jigsaw jet  
Boy don't let the Earth get in your face  
Its a middle-aged displace  
Its the middle ages snide  
  
Boy we're a million miles away  
And to think its so insane  
Take a chance on a one way ride  
Boy shoot a rocket clean out of your mind  
Oh these people ain't your kind  
No they ain't your kind at all  
  
Boy shoot a rocket clean out of your brain  
No these people ain't the same  
You can hear another call  
Boy the other book starts with no  
They don't show us how to grow  
They only show us how to win  
  
Boy the secret's in the bicycle shed  
Ain't no answers now they're dead  
To seek is a mortal sin  
Hey you know boy let your madness be the clue

Across the bay, across the tyne

China, china, wear your hair down low  
Lady, lady, you're frozen to the bone  
China, china, the catch was good today  
The oilskins clinging to my back  
And the lantern gently sways  
  
Oh don't you cry, the kids to bed  
Didn't mean the things I said  
  
China, china, the years go rolling by  
Laughter, sorrow, I will not make you cry  
China, china, think before you speak  
Always remember the ocean hauls as deep  
And if I'm tired of feeling low  
Don't let me sleep, you know

Drinking, smoking, talking quietly  
The water's calmer now

Somewhere in the back of my mind  
I fell in love with you  
But then  
Everything went wrong  
I couldn't even write a song  
There was nothing to look forward to  
I don't go out very much  
I'm always home on my own  
Baby, I was just too blind to see  
I wanted to conquer the world  
But the world had a mind of its own  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you away too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
So sing and all the world will shine  
Somewhere in this nursery rhyme  
A happy ending lies  
For all the lovers with the lonely eyes  
Easy come, easy go  
This is just to let you know  
Baby, I apologize  
How could I turn away love?  
How could I turn into stone?  
How could I turn my back on you?  
I wanted to be a success  
But success ever leaves you alone  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you way too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice

Take a thousand pin-up girls to stepney to bombay  
Take me to fancy restaurants to be amongst the whole milay  
And all the blue-eyed gals of 6 foot 3  
Are gonna leave you broken down on your knees  
Cause in the golden locks and their fluttering lashes  
You say, ""I told you"", all day long  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Just when you thought it was safe to get it on  
Watch out for their teeth boys you never trust a blonde  
  
I been dreaming of clinches  
With scene stealing wenches  
And stars of hollywood and Vine  
Too many goofs and ham-fisted moves and blaming it on the wine  
Now your best bet's, a hung lovin' brunette  
Make it quick boys cause I ain't got long  
And turn your back on the girl in black  
You never trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Forget all that stuff about ad-men, like my own father  
My daddy said, ""rocky, don't even trust your mom""!  
  
They all queue in line, they wanna see me hung, drawn and quartered  
Sure as anight on the moon shine, a recipe for leaving me slaughtered  
So beware of the smell and the lies they all tell  
One line from a fair blues song  
I'm telling you mate, when the hour gets late  
You cannot trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
You think you can hide behind peroxide, then you got it wrong, so wrong  
Watch out for their teeth boys, never trust a blonde  
  
Here comes another, never trust a blonde  
She could be a mother, never trust a blonde  
Even in China, they never trust a blonde  
She minght be a blinder, never trust a blonde  
Never, ever rush 'em, never trust a blonde  
It's best if I crush 'em, never trust a blonde  
One more for good luck, never trust a blonde  
Squeeze in another, never trust a blonde

Half-way home in the parking lot

It's dying just to be like me.  
He was fighting everything in sight,  
Died when he was 23.  
I used to meet him down at his cafe,  
He had one eye on the door  
And the other on the writing on the wall.  
He'd get restless and angry and we'd all laugh  
'cause we weren't really scared,  
We was his friends, he wouldn't hurt us at all  
And all he'd say was rain, rain, rain  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.  
We gotta leave this town.  
  
And glover was a dancer,  
Imitating eddie cochran by the jukebox.  
In the corner of the room  
'till he was lost.  
Barry 'n me, we used to escape, playing i go ape  
Wearing italian clothes drinking cider talking in the rain  
Hey babe, come over here, let me buy you a beer, what's your name,

You ain't what i want, you ain't what i need,

You know that feeling you get in your guts, all that frustration when you know  
You're going nuts.  
You gotta make a move.

Wiped the tears from my eyes, looked out the window,  
And it was still pouring down,

Never coming back again.

Before the covered wagons, before they lost it all  
  
They were hunters, they were fishermen und they often fought each other  
But one small tribe was different, their leader was a peaceful man  
They were weavers, they were painters, trading pelts for pretty colours  
Protected by the warriors for the beauty in their hands  
Roll back the years, roll back the years, to the river of tears  
  
The chief he had a daughter, she was young and she was beautiful  
He said, ""Go into the forest, get some berries for the dye  
But make your way back quickly, for the old bear's getting hungry  
I don't want you out there, when the sun falls from the sky""  
  
Her basket filled with berries, she headed back toward the village  
  
When a mighty roar erupted, she ran und hid inside a hollow tree  
Shadows were getting longer, the forest was getting colder  
And the chief began to panic, where could his daughter be?  
Lost in the years, lost in the years, on the river of tears  
  
In the camp the fires were dying when the old chief started crying  
Soon all the tribe were crying, the ground grew wet beneath their feet  
And the tears they turned to water and the water became a river  
And the river flowed like an arrow, to the foot of a hollow tree  
  
And the girl looked out in wonder, as she saw the water falling  
She knew it was her father and she swam to his canoe  
And all the tribe stopped crying, and the river started subsiding  
Into the hill of the Agoras, and so the legend grew  
Roll back the years, roll back the years  
Roll back the years, to the river of tears

Ian Hunter,Something To Believe In,/i/ian+hunter/something+to+believe+in_20066532.html,"Well, I lay underneath an ageless sky  
I watched the universe breathing  
There's more going on up there than meets the eye  
Give me something to believe in  
Which way's in and which way's out  
Every step is misleading  
Well, which way is up which way is down?  
You gotta have something to believe in  
Oh, let me dream, let me dream  
I spend my whole life dreaming  
I've been lucky but I'm still mean  
You gotta have something to believe in  
I didn't mean to hurt the people I hurt  
I was full of fear and loathing  
I wasn't up to much but I was all I had to go on  
Couldn't find nothing to believe in  
I don't like all them man made religions  
They all need a little spiritual healing  
They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture  
But we all need something to believe in  
So you believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now  
Gotta have something to believe in  
Well, I lay underneath a royal throne  
The gaudy paint was peeling  
Half an inch deep and twice as cheap  
Oh, give me something to believe in  
Fat Fred always packing lead  
On the corner dealing  
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days  
Give me something to believe in  
Now people worship what they see  
Looks can be deceiving  
Violence rages in abandoned hearts  
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in  
The chill chill is a bitter pill  
When it comes to leaving  
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here  
When you ain't got nothing to believe in  
Just woke up in Sarajevo city  
I watched all those mothers screaming  
Kids getting shot and for what and for what?  
Give me something to believe in  
Now there's fire outside, mud that slides  
Earthquakes shake the region  
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America  
They ain't got nothing to believe in  
For every seed of knowledge found  
For every grain of reason  
For every shred of decency  
There's something to believe in  
Now I lay me down to rest  
In the silence of the evening  
And the moon road shines from here to eternity  
I've got something to believe in  
You believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another  
I've got something to believe in

Ian Hunter,Sons And Daughters,/i/ian+hunter/sons+daughters_20066598.html,"There's a place in the city they call the Archway  
Where we rented three rooms for a dollar a day  
and I worked semi-skilled at the capstans for years  
And my wife was a good woman but the love disappeared  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I found me a band, I went out on tour  
So the kids wouldn't know I was with them no more  
When they said, ""Where's me dad?"" She'd say, ""He's a star!""  
Oh if only stars knew what fools they all are.  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I got a new contract, I got a new life  
No more capstans for me and I've got a new wife  
Sometimes she gets angry, says she wants a family  
Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage breaks up you're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope you all cope with the damage we done

Gotta run run run that's dumb  
A little less ego A little more fight  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Things go bad and the risks get high  
Sweeping dead bodies 'cross an open sky  
You took my pictures from your walls  
Ain't gonna trade with the pain of the New York Dolls

You froze my feelings, but that's alright  
And your standing in my light

Ian Hunter,Still Love Rock N Roll,/i/ian+hunter/still+love+rock+n+roll_20577268.html,"(Ian Hunter)  
  
Way back in the 50's - you never said a wrong word  
People were clean - people were mean  
Children should be seen, but children should be not heard  
You learned to keep your mouth shut - you did what you were told  
But then one day the radio played the sound that we'd all been waiting for  
The whole of our lives 'n'  
  
I still love Rock 'n' Roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along, singin' the song  
It's the only way - I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up in the morning - put the kettle on the stove  
Tommy Steele croons a Guy Mitchell tune  
I never felt more like singin' the blues - but if I had to choose  
You know I still love rock 'n' roll  
I still love rock 'n' roll (let me hear ya)  
  
I never been to Lubbock, Texas or Memphis, Tennessee  
I never washed dishes in Macon, Georgia  
I wasn't half as good and I wasn't half as pretty as you  
But I still got the feelings - embedded in my soul  
A rebel armada - Kettering, Granada  
It ain't my fault that I never grew up - I got bitten by your bug  
And I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock  
  
I know what you're thinkin' - it's a little bit strange to you  
I know what you're thinkin' - cause I'm thinkin' the same way too  
But oh those two little four letter words - they're all you need to know  
Cause when it all comes down to it - I don't like the sound of it  
When you mess around with it - I'm still in it for the thrill of it  
I know you tried to kill it but  
  
I still love rock 'n' roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along - singin' the songs  
It's the only way I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up every morning - I put the coffee on the stove  
The computer's gone - the turntable's on  
I can't believe it's 2001 - God, I must be knockin' on  
But I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll,

Ian Hunter,Still The Same,/i/ian+hunter/still+the+same_20066533.html,"They say that some people never grow up  
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love  
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams  
If life is real then so is my imagination  
All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?  
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?  
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back  
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain  
They say you can never go back  
What if my love's still the same?  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same  
When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on  
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong  
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on  
And on, and on it goes  
I can't pretend imaginary friends are better  
All I know is people change, people change, people change  
They say I'm supposed to forget and go on  
What if my love's still the same? Still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
(Oh, baby, now)  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same

Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees

People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv  
Just like a piece of dog shit  
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet  
One hour done passed  
Done watched two episodes of MASH  
And when I'm almost through  
They call my name and put me on ICU  
Halfway dead  
No respect and handcuffed to the bed  
Now the trauma starts  
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart  
So I begin the ass kissin'  
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician  
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103  
Only got a band-aid and an IV  
That's when I start cussin'

Ice Cube,Amerikkka's Most Wanted,/i/ice+cube/amerikkkas+most+wanted_20066625.html,"Ice Cube with The Lench Mob I got it goin' on  
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone  
One time can't keep the law in order  
'cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter  
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area  
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya  
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag  
or beat down for ya flag  
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger  
Keep one in the chamber  
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son  
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1  
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks  
So I get jealous looks  
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?  
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?  
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay  
I keep my 9 anyway  
for the day one of my homies want to squab  
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob  
  
(AmeriKKKa's most wanted)  
  
Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt  
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt  
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable  
to bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest  
I'm a menace crook  
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book  
From the shit I took from people  
I reap all your fat shit, jack  
Back to the criminals sect  
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet  
'cause I'm slick as slippery  
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me  
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs  
and sweat em like sweat hogs  
and get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it  
AmeriKKKa's most wanted  
  
Hey yo, here's what the poster read:  
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'  
That's all it said  
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green  
Hear shots and si-reens  
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings  
So give it up punk and then I just  
put another jack in progress  
It's the American way  
'cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A  
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' clepto'  
and tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so  
who gets the worm?  
And if I'm caught in a trap  
you know I'ma beat the wack  
with a payoff, cop gotta lay off  
FBI on my dick, stay off!  
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest  
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest  
so get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight  
'cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America  
  
(Hey yo Cube man, they on your ass)  
  
Word, but who the fuck has heard?  
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs  
Let em see a nigga invasion  
Point blank for the Caucasian  
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile  
Take me to your house, pal  
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see  
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry  
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D  
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me  
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be  
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV  
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out  
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out  
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when  
the ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in  
'cause the feds was out there ten deep  
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat  
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind  
The police didn't pay it no mind  
But when I start robbin' the white folks  
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope  
I said it before and I'll still taught it  
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

But I shook they worm and they hook  
Guppies hold they breath

Runnin' everything west of the Mississippi  
It's the unseen pullin' strings wit my pinky ring

And a drag from tha zig zag can't fuck with the Philly's

Ice Cube,Cold Places,/i/ice+cube/cold+places_20772338.html,"[Chorus]  
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis  
And it seem like the world is full of cold places  
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause  
you can do it and the man will get you through it  
I believe that, homey I believe that  
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back  
  
[Ice Cube]  
They say ""Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it  
How you get through it and them other niggas blew it""  
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it  
Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it  
So self-educate, nigga don't hate  
Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight  
Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube  
Fuck with them dudes them niggas is new school  
The game don't change just the players  
The rhymes don't change just the fuckin' rhyme-sayers  
They make it up as they go along  
But I'm goin' on 25 years strong  
The shit I say might get you through the day  
Or change your whole life, in a major way  
The shit they say, might catch you a case  
The shit I say, feel like your birthday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this  
Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss  
She said ""Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall  
All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers""  
It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket  
If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it  
Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat  
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets  
They keep callin' me  
They keep callin', all the lil' homies keep fallin'  
In them same traps niggas can't figure out  
In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out  
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled  
Get you in the system, get you in the soil  
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal  
Saw you UVN, nigga digital  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know, it's fucked up how they do us  
Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis  
Take that money that was allocated to us  
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us  
Watchin' Katrina, is worser than Ike and Tina  
See New Orleans get bitch-slapped by FEMA  
Louisiana got racist-ass politics  
Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!)  
Your honor, Osama, Obama  
Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin' with my comments  
They want us to quit, forget  
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics  
A lunatic is in the White House  
Make me wanna go do a lick right now  
But they'll make a nigga bow down  
in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry

I believe that, homey I believe that

Then turned around, and pulled out a gat.  
I knew it was a caper,  
I said: ""please don't kill my mother"", so he raped her.  
Tied me up, took me outside,  
And I was thrown in a big truck.  
And it was packed like sardines,  
Pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme.  
Took us to a place and made us work,  
All day and we couldn't have shit to say.  
? up the families forever,  
Until this day black folks can't stick together,  
And it's I, broke us down, made us pray to his God.  
And when I think about it,  
It makes me say damn, I want to kill Sam.  
  
Now in '91, they want to tax me,  
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me.  
And hang me by a ? till my neck snapped,  
Now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap.  
And put me on the dirt or concrete,  
But God can see through a white cheek.  
'Cause you're the devil in drag,  
You can burn your cross while I burn your flag.  
Try to give me the HIV,  
So I can stop making babies like me.  
And you're giving dope to my people Chuck,  
Just wait till we get over that, huh.  
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'm a blast,  
Can't bury rap, like your buried jazz.  
'Cause we stop being whores, stop doing floors,  
So bitch you can fight your own wars.  
So if you see a man in red, white and blue,  
Getting chased by The Lench Mob crew.  
It's a man who deserves to buckle,  
I want to kill Sam 'cause he ain't my motherfucking uncle.

Mama said a hard head make a tender ass  
To all the dogs that bark a lot  
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not  
We'll be creepin' in the parking lot  
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not  
Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra  
Bumpin' all the baddest bitches like I'm 'posed to  
What's yo name, what's yo number and ya culture  
You need nuts in yo face like a poster  
  
If you in a club nigga then shit bang  
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang  
If you on the block nigga then shit bang  
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang  
If ya in a Range Rov then shit bang  
If you in that six hundred then shit bang  
If you on that Steel Horse then shit bang  
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang  
  
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground  
Fuckin' pig want to act like he like me now  
In eighty six same bitch tried to lock me down  
And motherfuckers want to ask why I'm cocky now  
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious  
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes  
I'm makin' three wishes or takin' they pictures  
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches  
Egomaniac, lil' homies call me brainiac  
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't a knack  
So take a hit of that and remember that  
Where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at  
In the late night hour hit the front to back  
Check the motherfuckin' rims on the Cadillac  
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight  
And if the head right, nigga there every night  
  
This is for my niggas that's schemin' for cash  
And lookin' for ass (In the late night hour)  
This is for my people that's countin' they riches  
And pickin' up bitches (In the late night hour)  
This is for my niggas that's countin' they cash  
And lookin' for ass (In the late night hour)  
This is for my people that's schemin' for riches  
And pickin' up bitches (In the late night hour)  
So check it and everybody get naked  
This might be a nigga last record  
But respect it cause I could do it all night playa  
I'm all fight playa, you all spite playa  
It's all right playa, a nigga might care  
But to catch me you gotta do a light year  
Ice Cube insane in the membrane  
Baby go ahead please do the damn thang  
We gonna get chu' high nigga  
Our rhymes will get chu' by nigga  
Tell me if I qualify nigga  
To bail in like SuperFly  
I want to get that, cop that, buy that, drive that  
You want it too but don't know where to start at  
Fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat  
Nigga where ya heart at, leave ya on the tarmac  
Where my top at and my nigga Mack  
Ridin' shotgun, with the top gun  
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one  
Westside Connection is a doctrine  
This ain't another club song  
Or love song that why'all can fuck on  
So get the fuck on  
A nigga rich can't believe the bullshit that I'm stuck on

Ice Cube,It's A Man's World,/i/ice+cube/its+a+mans+world_20066628.html,"Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing  
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling  
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand  
Cause after I do ya  
Huh I never knew ya  
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits  
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits  
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow  
After we do it you can go home now  
I'm a brother with a big long...  
  
First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo  
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no  
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in  
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in  
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore  
And if that's what you're here for  
Exit through the door  
There's more  
To see of me but you're blind so  
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0  
  
Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo  
I know you like to rap and like to flow so  
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world  
Stay down and play the playground you little girl  
  
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping  
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening  
It never fails I'll always get respect  
And you lose so take a rain check  
  
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second  
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant  
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching  
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon  
  
Well you're mistaken  
It's not going that far  
I make brothers like you play the back yard  
You used to flow with the title but I took it  
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it  
  
Damn it look it  
Cause you're talking a lot of bull  
  
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives  
I hear females always talkin about women's lib  
Well get your own crib  
And stay there  
Instead of having more babies for the welfare  
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger  
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga  
For you to look at when your hair get nappy  
So take a piece of the pole and be happy  
  
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller  
You come in the room with your three-inch killer  
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone  
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown  
I'm a put it like this my man  
Without us your hand would be your best friend  
So give us credit like you know you should  
If I don't look good you don't look good  
  
I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant  
  
But you don't know how funky that I can get  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Man women I put a lot of fear in em  
Cause I had it up to here with em  
Drink a beer with em  
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day  
Yeah if you know what I mean baby  
  
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe  
If you was more of a man instead of faking it  
Women deserve the credit when they're making it  
  
Yeah so what's the problem  
  
Well I think we solved it  
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it  
  
Yeah I admit you can flow  
  
Well that's true  
  
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too  
  
Yeah I can see you got it good  
  
Oh that I know  
  
But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo  
The brand-new intelligent black lady  
  
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me  
  
So what up then  
  
Girl what you tryin to do  
  
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Or a big butt...

I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,  
Made by the Nero, look like a zero,  
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,  
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,  
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,  
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one  
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,  
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,  
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,  
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,  
A all-star, superstar entertainer,  
World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,  
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,  
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,  
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,  
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby  
  
[Chorus]  
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box,  
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,  
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box,  
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot,  
  
[Bridge]  
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,  
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,  
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,  
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,  
Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,  
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how,  
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,  
Just think if I had got locked up,  
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America,  
No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',  
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,  
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,  
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,  
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,  
I had to show the world, what I was made of,  
What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,  
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,  
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,  
See the whole industry had to bite my style,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,  
I got to let them know I never break like glass,  
What you looking at it's top notch world class,  
  
Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,  
I got to let them know I never break like glass,

But I don't party and shake my butt

And it sounds so sweet  
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats  
  
Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it  
Locate a dope break, and then I break it  
And give it that gangsta lean  
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass  
I make punk suckers run and duck because  
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to  
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi  
So when I come to your town don't crowd me  
Cause I know, you're gonna want to kick it with me  
But I know, none of y'all can get with me  
So you think you're protected  
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record  
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove

Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up  
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up  
My own momma can't keep me from loc'n up  
One ear out the other, one man out to smother  
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother  
Fuck you under covers and you dirty motherfuckers  
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers

Cause I'ma fuck up my baby's credit, let him regret it  
7 months old he's already got a jail record  
I'm the one to blame, put it in my momma name  
She's a drama queen, but I got the bling bling

These walls, make y'all forget about me  
I'm comin' home, in 2033  
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent  
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate  
She start lyin to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin'  
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin'

Here's another topic I'm addressin  
so learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson  
Sit your ass back and comprehend  
as I let you know about man's best friend  
Now remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie  
but now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me  
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection  
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin  
Cause if you run up and try to play mine  
I'd rather have a AK than a fuckin canine  
Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her  
me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher  
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that  
big black gat, aim and I hit that  
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den  
Nowadays.. a gat is man's best friend  
  
""Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay""  
""Dog-catcher, dog-catcher!""  
""Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay""  
""Man's best friend""  
""I can dig it!""  
  
Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack  
Just in case the little punks try to jack  
I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull  
under a coat, in the small of my back  
So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha  
it'll probably work, a 100 percent better  
Cause it'll keep me out of danger  
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber  
So this goes to all y'all intruders  
Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter  
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies  
I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies  
And I can't do that with Benji,  
Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie  
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den  
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend  
  
""Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs!""  
""Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit""  
""The profile of a typical American gun owner is this:  
Over thirty, white, male, middle class""

When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus

And the Indians took my motherfucking religion  
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?  
Like Jim Kelly said, ""You try to set me up?"" Shit...  
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise

Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK  
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner

I see you on TV talking more shit  
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch  
You's a bitch if I ever saw one  
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical  
And watch God show and prove  
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules  
So run devil run, you's to best start running

Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings  
Have migrated into East St. Louis  
Leaving three dead and two others injured  
No arrests have been made  
Police say this is a nationwide trend  
With similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma  
(female voice repeating in background:  
""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"")  
  
Boom, my homie got shot he's a goner black  
St. Louis niggas want they corner back  
Shooting in snowy weather  
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together  
Fuckin' police got the four-one-one  
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun  
But we ain't thinkin', bout the boys  
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys  
Now the shit's gettin' tricky  
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the khakis  
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle  
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle  
But the NARC's, raid about six in the morning  
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin'  
Put his glock to my chest as I paused  
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers  
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years  
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears  
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck  
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck  
The fool must be sparkin'  
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain  
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G  
Plus the Black Guerilla family  
And the white pride don't like Northside  
And it's a riot if any more niggas die  
No parole or probation  
Now this is a young man's summer vacation  
No chance for rehabilitation  
Cause look at the motherfuckin' years that I'm facin'  
I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up  
My life is fucked

Half black is the new black can't you tell?  
It was blue black like Wesley Snipes in new jack  
Now you got to have a white mama just to do that  
Tiger woods used to be a safe nigga  
Go ahead let your daughter have a date with him  
He'll mate wit 'em prolly in a wifebeater  
Tiger 'bout to change his name to cheater  
I don't like it when you call me big poppa  
From south central and I hate helicopters  
If we at school I'll break in your locker  
See me with a water bottle its probably vodka  
Drink responsibly or drink constantly  
Be who you wanna be in this economy  
Drunk as Sean Connery at the Bonavie  
Can't throw me out motherfucker I'm the honery  
Trust me I'll never be the nominee  
I don't kiss enough ass I'm too honery

Swim upstream eatin' all kind of meat  
West coast treat it like hyenas  
Take what you want from these lieing ass cheaters  
Eat the fuck out these beavers  
That's how we act when you don't wanna feed us  
Crazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus  
Might as well join us you ain't gonna beat us  
Please believe us you can ask Jesus  
I'ma be here bout as long as Regis  
Understand I never pledge of alligiance  
To this balla confusion might cause a contusion boy  
I see you're cruising for a bruising  
Fucking with a principal that don't like students  
Don't you know that detention is a lynching  
And if I fail to mention I'm spending out my pension  
No no no no  
The reason I hung in  
Cause this right here ain't no country for young men  
Sunny you done fucked up the churches money  
I'm red fox and you that big dummy  
This junkyard was a empire  
Y'all let it get over ran by vampires  
Most M.C's is god damn liars  
Like them fucking supervisors working up Kaiser?  
Bitch I'm not a dodger I'm a laker punk  
Yous a fucking clipper you can call me jack the ripper  
Cut you up by your gizzard then down by your liver  
Rooter by the tooter gut you like flipper  
Dipper y'all better treat me like the skipper  
Head trigga the heir nigga  
Air honkey and air critter  
I come through and kill every litter  
Like that like that like that  
No country for young men  
No no no no  
It's like balla' confusion  
No country for young men

Peace. Haha don't make me laugh!  
All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash  
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang  
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger  
How the fuck do you figure?  
That I can say peace and the gunshots won't cease  
Every cop killin' goes ignored  
They just send another nigga to the morgue  
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us  
They rather catch us with guns and white powder  
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me  
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy  
They kill ten of me to get the job correct  
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck  
'cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk  
And 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck  
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see  
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities  
The other color don't know you can run but not hide  
These are tales from the darkside...  
  
Verse two:  
  
You wanna free africa, I stare at yuh  
'cause we ain't got it too good in america  
I can't fuck with them overseas  
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine  
It was plain and simple  
The 9mm went to the temple  
Was the sound I put the bitch down  
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom  
Looked in the trash can yo it had room  
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute  
Covered with sweat I had the layback  
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback  
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun  
I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun  
It's gettin' critical - I start the five point o  
There they go - drive real slow  
I yelled out 'ice cube sucka'  
Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers  
I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off  
Its a shame, that niggas die young  
But to the light side it don't matter none  
It'll be a drive by homicide  
But to me it's just another tale from the darkside...  
  
Verse three: chuck d  
  
Standing in the middle of war  
The middle we flex  
When we die, they won't make check  
Ebony can't see to the darkside  
The term they apply to us is a nigga  
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner  
Same applies with a phd  
Who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul  
Watch his head go rollin'  
Who the fuck are they foolin'?  
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes  
Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what's under my waist  
[standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown  
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack  
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide  
Yet cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!

And I control your mind like Hitler  
You bow and vow to authority  
See now a sucker with a style just boring me  
So I show K.N.O.W.  
L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you  
Then I transform like a Deception  
With a mic as a bomb  
In my right palm  
But I don't stay calm  
So panic  
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic  
You thought I dropped a dud in your face  
Until you taste the blood of the bass  
Then you faint, or better yet pass out  
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out  
You think you're raw so you draw  
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue  
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle  
A noose on your neck, and you dangle  
From side to side in the blazing heat  
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off  
You feel you're turning red, it's said  
That your head burst  
And this is only the first verse  
Of the bomb  
  
Don't break up the fight let them rumble  
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick  
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach  
Now ask yourself, who's stupid?  
I take funky funky beats and I loop it  
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass  
And the boom from the bomb that I drop  
Stop  
You have a flat top as a fashion

But when they gotta go and show their ass in  
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah  
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres  
They'll steer you wrong  
Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me  
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme  
The system ain't wholesome  
They want to put a young brother in Folsom  
And others see me on lockdown  
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word  
To the brother that rolls the herb  
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that  
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact  
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap  
Now who's the mack?  
Who's the hoe?  
Who's the trick?  
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick  
But don't be alarmed  
When I trip and stumble and fumble  
And drop the (rewind)  
Drop the bomb  
  
I'm solo, you ask how I'm living  
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon  
With the L, the E, the N, the see, the H,  
The M, the O, the be , the great  
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha  
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers  
And if you try to upset the pot son  
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun  
I make the beats, I make the breaks  
I make the rhymes that make you shake  
Make you find  
Ice Cube never caught in the middle  
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little  
And still never hesitate to stutter step  
Or bust a repetition on the mic  
Still dissing all the hype  
From left to right  
How many left to fight?  
So what that Lench Mob like?

The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray  
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss  
I'm kickin' up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust  
This is my shit, my hood, my turf  
My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth  
I don't need nobody comin' in my territory  
tryin' to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin' sob stories  
  
Take a good look at my motherfuckin' jacker  
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker  
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out  
Comin' in my hood with his hand out  
Tryin' to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin' mack  
will put a fuckin' slug in his back  
And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast  
on greedy motherfuckers that trespass

Olly olly outcome free, here come the G  
I'm saggin', and Enter the Dragon like Bruce Lee  
I gots to get mo' money mo' money  
Can't get pussy with no money  
See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes  
got zeroes in back of a one  
Here's my gun, about to get paid at last  
But now I'm gettin' covered, in dirt and grass, kick it  
  
The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get  
The thicker the sweat  
Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout  
But ya in, but ya gotta get back out  
No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob  
Cross hair on your dome and your mind's blown  
You want to go home, ain't that a bitch?  
Cube, dig the ditch (yep)

I got a full time job of takin' suckers out  
Breakin' 'em off, yea word, I love revokin' clout  
Test me, stress me, who could the best be?  
The Teflon nine go through vests G  
But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself  
You're chasin' extreme wealth  
You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin' game  
Scandalous is your fuckin name  
  
I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit  
Ice Cube ""Wrong nigga to fuck wit!""  
I'm rich, pitchin' a bitch about gettin' mo'  
The big fish, swimmin' in big dough

Ghetto pass revoked motherfucker  
Punk-ass Mark, bitch-made, punk-ass trick in a basket  
You got caught up in the mix  
It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song  
So what really goes on  
Nothin' but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch  
They hate to see a young nigga rich  
But I refuse to switch even though  
'Cause I can't move to the snow  
'Cause soon as y'all get some dough  
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow  
Movin' out your neighborhood  
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good  
Little kids jumpin' on me  
But you, you wanna be white and corny  
Living way out  
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house  
Tryin' to be white or a Jew  
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?  
Get the hell out, stop bein' an uncle Tom  
You little sell-out, house nigga scum  
Give somethin' back to the place  
Where you made it from  
Before you end up broke  
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked  
I ain't sayin' no names, you know who you are  
You little punk, be true to the game  
Yeah, motherfucker  
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?  
Yeah, get a little money  
And moves out the neighborhood and shit  
But you still ain't shit  
When you first start rhymin'  
It started off slow and then you start climbin'  
But it wasn't fast enough I guess  
So you gave your other style a test  
You was hardcore hip-hop  
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped  
Givin' our music away to the mainstream  
Don't you know they ain't down with the team  
They just sent they boss over  
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over  
On MTV but they don't care  
They'll have a new nigga next year  
You out in the cold  
No more white fans and no more soul  
And you might have a heart attack  
When you find out the black folks don't want you back  
And you know what's worse?  
You was just like the nigga in the first verse  
Stop sellin' out your race  
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face  
Niggas always gotta show their teeth  
Now I'm a be brief be true to the game  
Yeah motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit  
But you know what, you still ain't shit  
That's right, I caught you slippin'  
You know I could've gat you  
Yeah, but I didn't even trip  
A message to the Oreo cookie  
Find a mirror and take a look, G  
Do you like what you see?  
But you're quick to point the finger at me  
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy  
Black man can't be no yuppie  
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes  
You don't associate with the Negroes  
You wanna be just like Jack  
But Jack is callin' you a nigga behind your back  
So back off genius  
I don't need you to correct my broken English  
You know that's right you ain't white  
So stop holdin' your ass tight  
'Cause you can't pass  
So why you keep tryin' to pass with your black ass?  
Mister big  
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge  
You only got yourself to blame  
Get a grip, Oreo and be true to the game  
And Ice Cube practices what he preaches  
He continues to live in South Central, Los Angeles  
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood  
Be true to the game

Verse 1:  
  
One, two, three and I come with the wicked  
Style and you know that I'm from the wicked  
Crew, act like you knew  
Cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo  
Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs  
While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]  
Play ya and I'll slay ya  
I got thug-made dough by the hey-a  
Ready to buck buck buck and it's a must  
To duck duck duck before I bust  
Lookin for the one that did it  
But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it  
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills  
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills  
Sittin at the pad just chillin  
Cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin  
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill  
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal  
Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that test tube baby  
Kick it cos I get wicked  
  
Chorus: (some toaster, once again won't translate to avoid offending)  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Don't say nuttin, just listen  
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison  
Come my way and get served  
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb  
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin  
Never seen with a happy grin  
Show the fat foul cos I'm down  
Take a look around  
And all you see is big black boots steppin  
Use my steel toe as a weapon  
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to  
Label this nigga, tape with the sticker  
Kickin out girls that's nicety  
Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T  
From here to New York  
I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork  
Swine, pig, dick  
Listen to the flow of a so-called negro  
Who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett  
Dig it cos I get wicked  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3:  
  
People wanna know how come  
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm  
Ready to bring that noise  
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys  
April 29th was power to the people  
And we might just see a sequel  
Cos police got equal pay  
A haza is a pig that don't fly straight  
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams  
Down with the pilgrims  
Just a super slave  
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave  
I'm wicked enough to board this  
Cos now it's on to the fullest  
Gorilla straight from the mist  
But I don't miss when it comes to this  
Bring the yellow tape  
The white cape, cos I'm so straight  
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it  
Bigot, cos I get wicked

Got bits and pieces on my mind commin' together like lettuce  
Dear God protect us, cause we're mobbin' like Good Fellas  
Alias Carlion, maybe the war is on  
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown  
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain  
Chillin' with millionares, ex-killers, and set-trippers  
My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha  
Slip ya worse than New Jersey Drive niggas  
Cause I'm in a  
Rush to bust straps like mack-10's  
When I'm strapped in  
A '95 Impala  
Breakin' like Vegas for my dolla  
While I'm commin' like a hundred miles and gunnin' who gonna test  
The southwests connect when it ain't shit you possess

Bitches can we fuck, niggas' can we blaze

I treat bitches like puppies  
I got a plate full of guppies  
Appropriate dish for the big fish  
Niggas' rich  
They have my straps  
Women with gaps  
Now they want to' sit in my laps and listen to raps  
But no  
Heard a nigga' tight named Mr. Mike  
Had to catch a flight, its only right  
Stepped of the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper  
Killa was the caper  
Lets make some paper  
  
(Mike)  
See we can't get enough of this gansta' shit  
Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta' click  
Lets take riches  
Witness two niggas' dome in the killa' zone  
Bring your killa' chrome  
Cause we headed to the terror dome  
Some niggas' never make it home  
As long as you got your front  
I got your back, its on like that  
And like this  
Let the weed blow, cause all you G's know  
Who got the wickedess flow  
The criminiminals

Say What  
Niggas' want to' short my cuts  
Say what  
Niggas' want to' check my nuts  
How you sound  
Ganstas' make the world go 'round  
Guppies bow down  
I'm with some killas' from H-town  
Chase his ass down to Atlanta, GA  
Find out where he stay  
Locate my gate  
Catch him in the hall  
Make his ass call  
And then I want ya'll to kill cousin's and all (Ha,Ha,Ha)  
They won't believe all the heat I bring  
From Palm Springs  
Niggas in line to catch the ring  
Of the dyin'  
Keepin' it calm, so talk slow  
Cause you'll never know  
When I'm ready to blow  
I'm a pro of the lifestyle of the Bloods and Crips  
Make a lot of cookies filled with chocolate chips  
The Westsides always been down with the South  
With Suave mother fuckin' House

One of our own

He goes where no one has gone

A hero comes home  
  
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks  
A dream of light  
Surrounded by hopelessness  
He finds the will to fight  
  
There's no surrender  
Always remember  
It doesn't end here  
We're not alone  
  
Just wait

A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
And he will come back on the crimson tide  
Dead or alive  
And even though we know the bridge has burned  
He will return  
He will return  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He knows of places unknown  
Always  
A hero comes home  
  
Someday they'll carve in stone  
""The hero comes home""

God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Oh, God, I don't know much about nothing.  
No, so give me a break.  
Anyway, won't anybody listen to me?  
Oh, oh.

But she's always in style while she waits  
Waving goodbye but she's too tired to cry and she's wasted  
A letter he wrote  
But it's far too expose so he throws it away  
The sound of regret as it's counting the steps back to safe  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to leave you with perfume and promises  
But we'll never know 'till we capture and bottle it  
'Cause wouldn't it be such a shame  
If all was wasted  
  
Not an inch of the room  
That isn't in bloom or in light  
So we drink 'till its dawn  
Every drip 'till it's gone and we're wasted  
It's a thing of the truth  
But we'll lie and we'll look for the perfect escape  
And the moment will go like melted snow in the rain

Stay for another morning  
Study the curves on my face  
Stay even when we're unknowing  
Stay 'till they tear you away

Came tripping to my room last night  
I cooked her a steak and I tried not to fake  
And still make everything alright  
She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares  
She tried hard not to let 'em show  
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin' up the meat  
But doubts fell in my mind like snow  
And when the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
It's a sunny afternoon and I'm sitting in my robe  
I'm dirty and I'm here alone  
There's a story on my table that talks about me  
And I want to stuff it down the author's throat  
And I'm sleeping with someone new every night  
And in the morning politely saying ""bye""  
  
And I'm nowhere and no one  
And I only wanna run  
And I feel like a hamburger bun  
And when you must  
Believe or bust  
The facade falls down  
When you're scared of a brand new care  
The facade falls down  
I got no reason to believe  
I got no reason but I'm New York Scumbag Tough  
And I'll keep on truckin'  
  
So night is falling  
And I'm getting' tired  
And it's time to get my slippers and books  
Got a sweater and glasses  
And something that passes  
For a way to get by in this world  
And I'm getting' tired  
Of so many different things  
I guess I'm just plain tired  
Or maybe too intelligent to believe  
In the obvious side of things  
And when voice says make a choice  
The facade falls down  
When your knees start to concede  
The facade falls down  
When the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
The facade falls down [Repeat: x5]

As I pulled in the drive  
Wearing leopard skin velvet  
And shiny black eyes  
""She looks like a sleeper""  
  
Said my wife at the time  
She had curls like Delilah  
And a smile like the sun  
She held my poor corpse  
Like she'd never be done  
And the caption in my mind said  
""This is the one""  
  
But I'm strong and I'm disciplined  
And I avoided her for years  
'Till one night, as usual  
With my heart full of tears  
A hand touched my back  
  
And she was standing right there  
Then I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury  
Whispering  
Whispering  
  
Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is  
How my life was a desert before she came in  
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin  
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house  
The way she curled up quietly on the couch  
I can still see her in my mind that way now  
Aah I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
  
Well time went by quickly  
And her confidence grew  
And she wanted this and that  
And she wanted those too  
And she wouldn't shut up  
And one day I just blew up  
Now she's in the hospital  
For the second time  
Maybe she'll die  
Maybe I'll cry  
Therapists would say  
""You're in denial""  
  
But love became inconvenient  
Love became a literal drag  
Very bad for business  
I'd be better off a fag  
She's a model de sport  
That I can't afford  
'Cause I'm a practical American  
From the Middle-West  
And I can piss on a grave  
While welcoming guests  
If cold's what I am  
I'm cold 'till the end  
And I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
Now I'm gonna continue walking  
In the modern world  
Which justifies every egotistical perversion  
With scientific talk  
And new ways to walk  
  
But I'll remember the religion  
She became to me  
And the other person I could have been  
So for now I'll say so long  
I gotta go do wrong  
I gotta go do wrong  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury

Down a river of a useless land  
It was such a beautiful day  
I heard a witch doctor say  
Ill turn you into a toadstool  
  
I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
A muscle twitch, an auto it swerves  
You want to speak you lose your nerve  
Infinity throws you a curve  
Dumps you in shit you don't deserve  
  
As life roars by you in a blur  
Leaves you murmuring a dirty word  
  
A page out of a comic book  
A chicken hanging on a hook  
A reverie, a babbling brook  
A sermonette, a TV. cook  
  
Shaking my hand at your fake head  
A suicide, a certain look  
  
A microphone, a blues guitar  
Piques a feeling near and far  
Stupidity a mental scar  
Cruel cruelty, oh cruelty  
Harboring no inspiration  
An alcoholic at the bar  
Every insult goes to far  
  
I was pissing on the desert sands,  
When the desert whispered to me,  
It said, isn't this a shame?  
Things will never be the same...  
I've learned this gets me so edgy  
  
Now I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
I was a teenaged dinosaur  
Stoned and obsolete  
I didn't get fucked and I didn't get kissed  
I got so fucking pissed  
  
Using my head for an ashtray

On my way to an unmarked grave  
Hi hi ho it's a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
  
There's pals at my table and mud on the floor  
There's bears in the area and wolves at the door  
Their singing a song about cookie McBride  
Who goes out a-trapping and then tails their hide  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to a rain filled grave  
So if you're planning a natural trip  
Don't call up snooping on burial ridge  
The searchers will come and discover your hide  
High, wet and hanging like cookie McBride  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On your way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
Who will remember the money you saved?  
I'm in over your head

Iggy Pop,V.I.P.,/i/iggy+pop/vip_20334766.html,"I'm a Very Important Person  
I park in the V.I.P  
And when I go to the bathroom,  
I go in the V.I.P toilet  
And when I wanna change a light bulb,  
I don't do it myself  
I have a technician  
Cause I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
Now, as I began to become a V.I.P,  
I forgot what I've become a V.I.P for  
I began to grow accustomed to people saying  
""Right this way sir, drinks are on the house""  
Flight attendants on airplanes saying  
  
""Please, really, I don't wanna bother you sir, but it's such a pleasure to
have you on board.  
May I have your autograph for my daughter?""  
""Yeah baby right after I go to the toilet  
I I'll give you a couple of 'em  
Cause I'm a V.I.P!""  
  
Now,one thing about V.I.P is,is they never seem to be alone  
Oh no !  
The ""true"" V.I.P must travel with an entourage !  
People who say ""Right on boss""  
Cause it's a V.I.P!  
Right on boss  
I'm a V.I.P!  
As I began to realize that I had gained V.I.P status,  
Worries began to creep in  
What if one day,I woke up,and I was no longer a V.I.P?  
No more good tables at the restaurants,  
No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets,  
No more top notch booty  
No more entourage to say ""Right boss""  
I began to have nightmares  
And in my nightmares, I was just a fucking nobody.  
Laying at the beach, imagining myself being a VIP!  
Just like I was before,  
Hearing the applause in my head  
Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender  
  
V.I.P  
V.I.P  
  
Of course, when one becomes a V.I.P,  
One meets other V.I.Ps  
At social occasions,  
And one inevitably thinks,  
""thick! How shallow and crass these people are!  
They're not down to earth and real like me,  
Oh no! I'm a very special V.I.P""  
  
Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood,  
Is the ""V.I.P reflection effect"", during which anyone associated with the
V.I.P,  
Becomes a sort of V.I.P in their own right! Such as ""son OF the V.I.P"",  
""Guitar player FOR the V.I.P"",  
""Girlfriend WITH the V.I.P"",  
""Accountants of the V.I.P""  
The maid, the dog, the music publisher, huh!  
All enjoy a sort of 'reflected glory', as in  
  
""Hi this is Nastea  
I work for Iggy  
And I'd like 6 tables tonight in the V.I.P section  
And he needs passes for everyone  
And free drinks of course  
In the V.I.P area""  
Right on boss  
Cause I'm a V.I.P.  
It's also true that when one is a V.I.P, everybody's happy to see you, all the
time!  
And there's an implicit rule that a V.I.P must never, never  
Be on a barn.  
Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day  
And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood.  
They will ""thck!tchk!tchk ! mur mur mur mur mur!"",  
And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention:  
A ""difficult"" V.I.P.  
Psychologists tell us that a sense of self-esteem  
Is so necessary in today's world.  
As a V.I.P, I can guarantee you, you'll never be alone.  
You'll never be alone.  
Cause you're a V.I.P!

Oh, no! not in spring-time.

I traveled each and ev'ry highway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few

I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all, when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fill, my share of losing  
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way,  
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""  
  
For what is a man, what has he got?  
If not himself, then he has naught  
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels

Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check  
  
I don't ever want to let you down  
I don't ever want to leave this town  
Cause after all  
This city never sleeps at night  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
This road never looked so lonely  
This house doesn't burn down slowly  
To ashes  
To ashes  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was

Displayed it's might

Filled the air  
Riding wings of wind,

Had been longing to hear  
The sweet sound of victory,

Everytime was filled with questions, and when I asked, no one knew  
Till I found the answer in You

As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You

Love is in the air around me, hope abounds everywhere  
Living life in the arms of Jesus, learning how to really care  
Every day is filled with purpose, all the old is made new  
And I know I owe it all to You

Fall down on his knees?

What can lift my lowest thoughts  
To the very throne of God?  
And what can lift my eyes from earthly things?

When led by God's spirit,  
It's a mighty refrain  
It flows with a force  
That carries a current of change  
The power of praise  
  
Praise can give my soul a fire  
When my passion's been consumed  
Praise can give my spirit's song a voice  
Praise can fill my mind with peace  
When doubts have overcome  
Praise can fill my longing to rejoice  
Praise can turn my sorrow  
To a holy celebration  
Praise can turn my weeping  
Into tears of joy

Incubus,Calgone,/i/incubus/calgone_20067192.html,"On my way home, police car pulled me over.  
After they left, I puttered out of gas.  
Triple-A' came, but my card was expired!  
I had to walk home, and of course, it rained half the time.  
I tried to get some shut-eye, then I was abducted!  
  
They put cold things in my butt.  
They sampled a bit of my D.N.A.  
They left me on top of my sheets,  
I dreamt I went potty, then woke up drenched in me.  
This day sucked the hardest ever  
  
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.  
A little bit less than nothing would go my way.  
I got up to toss my soiled sheets,  
the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe.  
It was then that I sensed the irony (burning me),  
then I heard the voice say,  
""Come sail aboard S.S. Nepenthe!""  
  
I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over.  
I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas.  
Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee.  
In actuality, I let the zetas probe me.  
Yesterday was all my fault.  
  
I let negativity get the better of me.  
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds!

Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS

So far away from home - so far away from home.

Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see

And I dreamed I was dying.

We come on a ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour

Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a jew?  
'cause they're working for the clampdown

When we're working for the clampdown  
We will teach our twisted speech  
To the young believers  
We will train our blue-eyed men  
To be young believers  
  
The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again  
I'm not working for the clampdown  
No man born with a living soul  
Can be working for the clampdown  
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall  
How can you refuse it?  
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power  
D'you know that you can use it?  
  
The voices in your head are calling  
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming  
Only a fool would think someone could save you  
The men at the factory are old and cunning  
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'  
It's the best years of your life they want to steal  
  
You grow up and you calm down  
You're working for the clampdown  
You start wearing the blue and brown  
You're working for the clampdown  
So you got someone to boss around  
It makes you feel big now  
You drift until you brutalize  
You made your first kill now  
  
In these days of evil presidentes  
Working for the clampdown  
But lately one or two has fully paid their due  
For working for the clampdown  
But ha! gitalong! gitalong!  
  
And I've given away no secrets  
Who's barmy now?

You wrap my soul in the beauty of it all  
You take me away from my incompleteness  
Lead me all the way or not at all  
And times too precious here

If I touch you tell me will you blow away  
Please don't move now until you set me free - set me free  
  
I can't wait for clues to you

Remove my eyes from this deathly haze

I went little by little

And I got emptied  
And started my way back

Trusting a stranger  
A boatman at the shore  
  
The scourge of hope  
The ugly face of danger  
The keepers of the keys  
Had me down on my knees  
In front of the gilded doors  
  
And in a world where every ax was poised to grind  
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine

When you called it an opiate  
A simple way to cope  
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes  
  
They start out tight  
And then they hurt your tired feet at night  
But then they give a little day by day  
And then before you know it

If it's got my name, it's got your name on it  
Everything I own has got your name on it

You were at the river getting me across and now

Theres still solid ground to be found  
I said dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Though I may seem strong  
Its only because  
Cause youre around  
  
You know me better than I do  
You know how things go to my head  
I said a few things to you  
Things that were better left unsaid  
But dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Cause you know I love you  
And I always  
I always will  
  
Now love  
Loves a sweet kind of pain  
It can give you wings to fly  
Then it drags you on down  
But darling  
Ill never love this way again, no  
Youre the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest love  
Ive ever found  
  
You know me better than I do

Look out your window and I'll be gone

To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
Like you've never done before  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
I can't hear you anymore  
Thinking and wondering all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told  
I gave her my heart, she wanted my soul  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
I'm going down that long lonesome road babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good a word babe  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
Coulda done better but I don't mind

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now

Won't you look down upon me jesus  
You gotta help me make a stand  
You just got to see me through another day

I've been walkin' my mind to an easy time  
My back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around  
But there's hours of time on the telephone line  
To talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain

Most of us stick with our row to hoe  
But not you, you're the black crow  
With a straight line, and no time  
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way  
I am the words you'll never say  
I crossed the great beyond of fear  
I opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view  
You went there too  
Fly away little bird  
Find the song in you that no one's heard  
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight  
Through this short life  
Everyone's got a deep regret  
We try to ground ourselves to forget  
But your race to the end is neck and neck  
You love them, you love them not  
The birds of prey who wreck your nest,  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way

Opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view

Window panes and sheets of glass  
That you won't see  
You fly too fast  
One day it will be over  
Fly away little bird

Was the one that I wrote you in my heart  
That never made it to the world

Indigo Girls,Ghost,/i/indigo+girls/ghost_20067260.html,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer  
The last truce we ever came to  
In our adolescent war  
And I start to feel the fever  
From the warm air through the screen  
You come regular like seasons  
Shadowing my dreams  
  
And the Mississippi's mighty  
But it starts in Minnesota  
At a place that you could walk across  
With five steps down  
And I guess that's how you started  
Like a pinprick to my heart  
But at this point you rush right through me  
And I start to drown  
  
And there's not enough room  
In this world for my pain  
Signals cross and love gets lost  
And time passed makes it plain  
Of all my demon spirits  
I need you the most  
I'm in love with your ghost  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Dark and dangerous like a secret  
That gets whispered in a hush  
(don't tell a soul)  
When I wake the things I dreamt about you  
Last night make me blush  
(don't tell a soul)  
And you kiss me like a lover  
Then you sting me like a viper  
I go follow to the river  
Play your memory like a piper  
  
And I feel it like a sickness  
How this love is killing me  
I'd walk into the fingers  
Of your fire willingly  
And dance the edge of sanity  
I've never been this close  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Unknowing captor  
You never know how much you  
Pierce my spirit  
But I can't touch you  
Can you hear it  
A cry to be free  
Oh I'm forever under lock and key  
As you pass through me  
  
Now I see your face before me  
I would launch a thousand ships  
To bring your heart back to my island  
As the sand beneath me slips  
As I burn up in your presence  
And I know now how it feels  
To be weakened like Achilles  
With you always at my heels  
  
This bitter pill I swallow  
Is the silence that I keep  
It poisons me I can't swim free  
The river is too deep  
Though I'm baptized by your touch  
I am no worse than most  
In love with your ghost  
  
You are shadowing my dreams  
(In love with your ghost)  
(In love with your ghost)

Standing on the edge of a drowning blue.  
  
I look behind my ears for the green  
Even my sweat smells clean  
Glare off the white hurts my eyes.  
Gotta get out of bed get a hammer and a nail  
Learn how to use my hands, not just my head

From a chin in a hand in a thoughtful pose  
Gotta tend the earth if you want a rose.

Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension,  
Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts  
But my life is more than a vision  
The sweetest part is acting after making a decision  
I started seeing the whole as a sum of its parts  
  
My life is part of the global life  
I'd found myself becoming more immobile

Big dipper hangin' over the city

And it ain't no use in  
Explainin' the scenery  
  
I said  
Kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Kind friend  
Remember who I am  
  
I was too late in Spokane  
So I caught a ride through the cascade range  
I saw the sun die in Olympia  
Running down on capital lake  
  
Now I ask you for some relief  
It's one true root that you bring to me  
It's 3 am  
And it's good company

Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I been

Don't know if I'm gonna see you again  
It's okay friend

So I'll meet you in New Orleans or I'll see you around  
'Cause I don't know if it's worth coming down

From a gold rush town  
  
And I say  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I've been

Indigo Girls,History Of Us,/i/indigo+girls/history+of+us_20067294.html,"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face  
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed  
Statues of lovers every place  
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love  
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory  
Smashed by the bombs from above  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife  
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil  
There's just no medium for life  
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth  
In a dusty cathedral the living God called  
And I prayed for my life here in earth  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand  
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon  
Bleeding its light like a lamb  
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep  
And it dawns on me the time is upon me  
To return to the flock I must keep.  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.

Painted ourselves in a corner  
Lost for ideas blindly fishing  
For a compliment or kindness  
Just to bring us into view  
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you  
I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words  
After all that we've been through  
I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands

A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers  
If I don?t get out I'll do something I don?t wanna do.  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.  
Was it so long ago  
That we sat and talked in your car  
Your things were all packed  
And the place you were headed not really that far  
Years later I think  
That I would have been much more alive  
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive  
Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now  
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling  
That I'm lost somehow  
I'm just a ghost looking in  
Out of my own life just visiting  
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep.  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache  
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.

Sunbeams shining through his hair  
Appearing not to have a care  
Pick up your gear and gypsy roll on

Will you hide the dead mans ghost  
Will he lie beneath the clay  
Will his spirit float away

Now we're out in the back with the barking dogs  
My heart the red sun  
Your heart the moon clouded

When summer's beginning to give up her fight  
And every thought's a possibility  
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen  
Why do you spend this time with me  
Maybe an equal mystery  
  
So what is love then is it dictated or chosen  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years  
Or is it just pop emotion  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
And if it ever was there and it left  
Does it mean it was never true  
And to exist it must elude  
Is that why I think these things of you

I can hardly think of two  
But not everything is better spoken aloud  
Not when I'm talking to you  
  
Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight  
Breaks a bottle to christen her  
Basking in the exploits of her thief

Is to meet in the middle of impossibility

Equal partners in a mystery

Was it all a bunch of hype?  
You say, ""I'm losing inspiration,  
One band at a time.  
I gotta know there's someone, somewhere, out there singing for our side.""  
Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue.  
And what we build together, we share that too.  
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,  
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.  
Where are you going to now,  
Now that the goings gone?  
So here's to your survival  
And swimming up the stream,  
Crossing over one dam after another  
Until we get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination?  
I saw it on the T.V.  
Did it lighten up your load?  
And every fucking D.J.  
Did you feel affiliated,  
Is telling me I'm free.  
Like you really had a home?  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high?  
Free to be a trend

Theres a seabird above you  
Gliding in one place  
Like jesus in the sky  
We all must do the best we can  
And then hang on the that gospel plow  
When my life is over  
Gonna stand before the father  
And the sisters of the sun are gonna  
Rock me on the water now

And we never have the money for the flight

Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans  
I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black  
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean  
  
And there's something bout the Southland in the springtime  
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason  
Though I miss her when I'm gone it won't ever be too long  
'Til I'm home again to spend my favorite season  
  
When God made me born a Yankee He was teasin'  
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'  
Than the Southland in the springtime  
  
In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper  
Beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand  
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations  
And the peach trees stitched across the land  
  
There'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside  
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers  
And the smoke from the chimney meets its maker in the sky  
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers.

My eyes are wrung out and dry as a bone  
And I taste much better alone

Cold tiles beneath your knees  
Your body broke your fall  
Spitting into your own

Inside your porcelain fists  
Your palms begin to crack

Tell me you want me tonight

If that's alright then let me know  
I know exactly what you want  
But if you tell me we can go  
So put your summer hands all over my summer body  
You'll get some of this after my summer party  
I can make it hard if that's the way you want it  
If that's the way you want it

Tell me you wanna be bad

Colton Grundy the Undying  
I'm dead and lifeless  
The casket maker  
Soul taker, your life is  
Priceless  
Especially on the black market  
If you're alive and breathing  
Then you're a moving target  
Which means you can be hit  
And the quickest lickity split  
Lay down in the ground  
Surrounded by a casket  
That I built  
Out of warped woods and drift wood  
Rusted railroad spikes  
Collected from the neighborhood  
Skilled in the family trade  
I'm center stage  
In the most horrific side of me  
You'll ever see is like an instinct  
Some sort of nervous twitch  
I'll stack the bodies 10 high  
And bungee cord them to the trailer hitch  
Pulling dead weight  
Just made it over the border  
And out of state  
No time to debate  
Time is short and the day is only so long  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
[Chorus: X2]  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
(The moon is out and I'm digging on it) (x2)  
(Colton Grundy)  
Blaze Your Dead Homie  
The unliving I'm dead and lifeless  
The clock bearer  
So terror the time is  
Precise when your body is separating from soul  
That's where I take your life  
And transform you to a ghost  
And you're powerless  
Body limp, like dead fish  
Only choose 10, never more  
Less cause that be selfish  
No headstones  
Just 10 open holes in grounds  
And dead bodies surround me  
You're face down  
No garbage bags  
Not saying they trash  
I'm just saying it preserves the body  
And makes it last  
For the future  
And the time the to come ahead  
Take it from the dead man  
Things are easy when you're dead  
I'll be back for you  
I left the shovel right beside you  
I hid you pretty good  
I don't think no one's gonna find you  
Time is short and the sun's coming along  
I left the burial site before dawn  
[Chorus: X2]  
I left the burial site before dawn  
I left the burial site before dawn  
(The moon is out and I'm digging on it) (x2)

Am I the sand man?  
The one that freed you or your ghost  
Or the mad man?  
The one that slitining your throat  
Tonight's the night  
10 more coming to join you  
I'll make it interesting  
I would never disappoint you  
There's 30 of ya'll all  
Together and collected  
And this here, chunk of the Earth  
That we've infected  
And now you're expecting them to grow  
Into the millions  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend  
And kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend and kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend and kill me

Revenge is mine  
12 people will die tonight""  
[Violent J]  
Now I look and then reborn  
Though I have just until dawn  
I remember every face  
Spirits show me every place  
First one sleeps inside his bed  
Place my fingers on his head  
To each temple push and smother  
Till my fingers touch each other  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Next one makes love to his wife  
Only wish to take his life  
For his family's done no wrong  
Place his children on the lawn  
Tell the misses, leave the room  
Less she wish to witness doom  
Grab the squirming filthy goat  
And shove the dresser down his throat  
[Violent J]  
I must quickly use my gift  
Next two work the midnight shift  
Drinking coffee in the back  
I will listen to them chat  
Hear them speaking of my death  
Hear the laughter in their breath  
But the laughter quickly died  
When their heads collide  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
[Violent J]  
Now my anger's growing worse  
Next one's working as a nurse  
Have to make a doctor's call  
Drag my body down the hall  
Grab a scalple and a blade  
Time to play the nurse's aide  
Operate and strap her down  
Carve her face into a clown  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Killed another then three more  
Now we're down to only four  
This man drives a taxi cab  
Another wicked life to grab  
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died  
Let's go for a taxi ride  
In the wreck of twisted steel  
The stearing wheel becomes his meal  
[Violent J]  
This man watches his TV  
Scanning channels endlessly  
Stops at station forty-four  
It's the Wicked Clown Show  
Watch me juggle, watch me dance  
In 3-D watch me enhance  
Watch me crawl out from the screen  
And squeeze your neck until you're green  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
Time...  
[Violent J]  
Even though, there's just one left  
I feel my bones becoming stiff  
And now I wonder endlessly  
The spirits have abandoned me  
My limbs are falling piece by piece  
My ears and fingers in the street  
But still yet see no morning sun  
And here's my victim's early run  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Quickly grab him from behind  
Round his neck with fishing twine  
Keep him still and pull the string  
Watch his head go bobbaling  
Listen to my riddle song  
Even though my crime was wrong  
Murder me just for your law  
And I'll be back for all y'all  
Die!  
You're gonna die...  
I'll be back for all y'all...

Stab 'em with garden tools or beat 'em with pipes  
So don't come out, stay inside cozy and tucked

To the desk in school then I run down the hall  
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches

Just cause I don't look like everybody

Just because now and then I like to let it stretch  
Up a couple feet to get a better sight

Try to play me out just cause I'm running with the sideshow  
Or maybe it's the leg growing out my neck  
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet  
I'm popping in like a pound of lead  
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head  
Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits  
'cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus  
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows  
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow  
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone  
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone  
So don't be stickin your finger in my face stank  
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the...

Have Snake woman kick my love to the curb  
She busted into my tent, now I'm fucked  
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck, uh  
Fuck that, bitch, suck that  
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac  
Just two balls hanging with no protection so  
I move real careful and slow

Call me Don Knots 'cause I'm getting on it every week, uh  
So come see the carnival and threw me your change, bitch  
I chill with the three rings

Then I went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad  
To the arrow tips I tied gasoline soaked rags  
Climbed up with the Zippo, lit 'em off in the sky  
A trail of black smoke leading off in the sky  
I bought some Chinese stars from the Kung-Fu surplus  
They had 'em under the glass, I made the purchase  
Climbed up and I whizzed 'em off in the sky  
  
Even stood up on the chimney, whizzed 'em off in the sky

I threw it in next to the Faygo in my shopping cart  
I got home, climbed up and blew it off in the sky

I got a blow gun too, a real one at that  
I dip the tips in poison, lay up on my back  
And now they're piercing through the air straight up into the sky

All crowded together expecting a show and some dollars  
But instead the shit you're gunna see  
You'll fear it in Hell  
It a constant explosion, see and feel it you shall  
  
(Chorus) (x1)  
  
In the deserts of Nevada  
Where nothin else matta,  
It's the perfect place for you and your intestines to splatta  
And while Bang! Pow! Boom! steady stomps you all out  
You're in the hole for the nuclear fall out  
With the snakes and fakes creapy sneaks  
Hooks and crooks and horney freaks  
Shaddy ladies evil ernies richy richs and charlie cheaps  
Bang! Pow! Boom! they say the show is the bomb  
I heard it's strait up explosive, some even call it napalm  
Nobody battles back, this ain't no kinda war  
It's a one way execution, blow you strait to hell through the floor  
What the fuck you think you here for? sound the alarm  
Ladies and gentleman eat shit and die, let's bring I'm out  
  
(Chorus) (x1)  
  
The air is thick with sick demented brains and thoughts,  
But here they are all together, every one of them caught  
This is a celibration, in fact the carnival's cheering  
It's not too often Bang! Pow! Boom! makes an aperence  
And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash  
But for now let us enjoy, the big bang blast!  
  
(Chorus) (repeat until all fifty-thousand can be fit into one ashtray)

(Before the anti-Christ who is coming)  
  
Remember me bitch 8th grade  
Ball park skinny ass well-fare aid  
Ulster and Bruce brothers we was the shit  
Dungeons Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks  
Quit school nobody missed us,  
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us  
Now look at these beautiful model type high class women  
Takin' my dick in em  
You don't remember my kind in class  
The whipped out freak starin' at your ass  
Never had the courage to even say hi  
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by  
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind  
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin' in line  
And that's fine while you're working your charm  
Look beneath the paint bitch its the scrubs who won  
  
You used to say ""Ahhh Hah!""  
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again  
An outcast I knew I had to do something  
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin'  
Open up shop got what you need  
Speakers clothes CD's or bags of weed  
But that shit got me nowhere except jail  
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail  
So now we're right back at the place we started  
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs  
Assed out but we was like ""fuck y'all""  
We got each other and the drop of the homie call  
Look at us now bitch holdin' platinum  
All up on my dick but I'm the same as back then  
Forget the money and fame because  
Beneath the paint life's just as it always was  
  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
  
Another girl I don't dare to confide in  
Playing that role it hurts inside  
Here I am thinking she wants me  
She only wants that killer on her CD  
Just when I couldn't feel any worse  
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first  
The day I finally get to leave this land  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)

Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to  
The darkness from which it came""

Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme  
It's about, The Boogie Woogie Man  
Keep your light on as long as you can  
Cause when it cuts off, so does your head  
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed  
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom  
Little Jimmy Jimmy, uh, got em

Things go bump in the night, me creeping  
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe  
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor  
Fuck it, you're dead anyway  
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway

And Crazy Carlos smacked his baby mama off in the head  
And Jonathan beat his son like his daddy beat him  
But swore he'd never do nobody like his daddy did him  
And then Sandra used her pussyhole to get to the top  
And Baby D, he shot somebody, it went bad from the drop  
And then Diane worked at a hospital, took care of old souls  
She was abusive, her afterlife sees no gold roads  
And Mr. Richards was a richie fella, born with every penny  
Everyone around him hungry but he never gave 'em any  
And then Steven was a businessman, an educated citizen at the top  
Pornography of children in his laptop  
Take your spot and hang on 'cause it's crowded in hell  
You in the belly of the beast now, it was Heaven in jail  
And don't try to make no friends 'cause don't nobody got no tongues  
If the Witch look your way, somehow it crushes your lungs..

'Til he caught one, then everything stops, the floor drops  
As he's screamin' and fallin', we see how pointless was the ballin'  
When eternity is callin', agony will be appallin'  
Don't cry for the dead 'cause they cry for you  
Because we laugh about an aftermath but they know how true  
And listen, ain't no-fuckin'-body gettin' it worse than you and me  
And ain't nobody gettin' it worse than you and me and we will see  
A pterodactyl swoop through the caverns of Hell  
And carry 2 unfortunates off to the Ogre's cell  
It ain't no guards playin' cards, ain't no uniforms needed  
You the only one around butt-naked, bloody and bleedin'  
With 7 demons in your ear got you believin' your heathen  
Talk you into pulling out your own intestines to get even  
You were born with the shine but you lost it down the line  
You fucked life up and you can't rewind..

Judge Shaw was a judge, snake holes are his eyes  
There go anohter judge, another judge, somebody despise  
And there go so many judges, the judges in Hell  
So many fuckin' judges in Hell, they bludgeon 'em well  
Fat Pat like his daddy was a bigot pullin' duty  
He can tell it to them gargoyles fuckin' on his booty  
And Shawna liked money but mistook it for love  
Now when the Witch's wings spread, she give him head and look above  
Black Sundays, Armageddon, maggots and rape  
Hell's Pit got some fire for you faggots with hate  
Eddie Burrow hit his wife and put a tooth in his knuckle  
Later on he lost his life in a scuffle, now he in trouble  
You was a rebel, you nobody no mo'  
To the Devil on the double you go  
Ain't no level to the trouble you know  
And eternity goes..and eternity goes..

She was lovely, long hair, short, nice figure though  
So at the funeral, it made me cry, watch her die  
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep without a wink  
I only think about my lady, I want my baby  
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me  
  
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me  
I see my therapist, he only tells me I'm in trouble  
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel  
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kinda funny  
Don't dig too fast or to see things could get bloody  
I watch my baby, I hit the top of baby's coffin  
I thinking, she's better off inside if she died  
Yeah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me  
'cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me  
I prey it open, the odor hits me, there she is  
I lean down to give her a kiss because I need a...  
[Chorus (1x)]  
Girl that make me happy, a girl that make me cry  
A girl that passed away back in 1985

She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed  
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains  
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true  
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue  
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes  
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes  
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar  
Is that a bug upon her face? oh, it's just a booger  
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips  
And then her neck crack, also does her hips  
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty  
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty  
I notice that, when we lay together on the lawn  
We lay till dawn, I notice her left eye is gone  
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright  
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a...

[Verse - Violent J]  
I tried to visit Shaggy, I stepped up off of my porch  
And it was dark as fuck I couldn't see, not even with a torch  
I hear the streets talkin', and they aware of my move  
They whisperin' and swingin' from the trees, above I hear the loons  
I try to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats  
Demonic zombies runnin' up on me, I slap 'em with the bat  
But my eyes keep bleedin' from the rays of the darkness  
They powerful and burn you somethin heartless (uh!)  
I hear a giant thumpin', some kind of ogre or somethin'  
I see the phantom screamin' as this giant behemoth is comin'  
And it swung at me, I felt a rip my head went spinnin'  
And flippin' and rollin' and finally landed in position  
I could see my body still standin', headless as fuck  
It finally fell but what the hell, still got my nugget but I'm stuck  
I can't move fuck I'm only a face, why even try?  
On top of that, it's a centipede crawlin' in my eye  
I want to die..

I got the time so why should't I?

I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold  
I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road  
And some are fully rotted, and some they must've just spotted  
I seen a headless body that resembles J's, but I doubt it  
I seen a centaur, I threw a pitch fork at it above  
I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood  
I'm fuckin' 'bout to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on  
It's giant crows swoopin at me, got me carry me on  
I cut it's claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand  
Even in Hell, you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand  
And as I'm fallin' now, I see the Witch is ridin' my chest  
With its claws on my neck, screamin' I should've confessed  
I slammed down into an iron gate, a demon statue near me  
Four points stickin' out my chest, I'm hangin' there dearly  
And the hungry goblins, they got a fire beneath me  
They cookin' my legs, to make myself eat me  
I want to die..

Line up and see him  
He's nasty, he's disgusting  
  
He's filthy, he is a freak show  
And you can see him live at the  
Carnival of Carnage  
You, young man  
  
You look like you could use a viewing  
Of a good freak show  
Line up, bring your sister, your brother  
And see the ghetto freak show

My mucking head blew up  
My chins in an old man's backyard  
I gotta sneak threw his yard  
To find the fothermucker  
And he's gotta pitbull dog  
And it's sitting on my chin like a frog on a log  
I throw a bone to try to distract  
'cause I'm wanting my chinny-chin-chin back  
I'll never be one to boast  
But there's my tongue hanging off the lightpost  
'cause my head exploded  
And my brains unloaded  
All over this beautiful city  
Teeth and bones to the nitty gritty  
There's my eyeball stuck to the wall  
Right next to my splattered jaw  
I don't dig this game  
Chasing my brains all through the sewer drains  
My head's all over the block  
'cause I done went lunatick-tock tick-tock  
Come on, dawg, what's wrong with my head?  
It blew apart but I still ain't dead  
I get no respect  
I got nothing but guts hanging off my neck  
But I'll still chilling

Best believe it's mine  
Oh, forget about my tongue  
'cause vato can't breathe without no lungs  
I lost both of mine  
Now that's an item that I wouldn't mind to find  
But forget about dat  
'cause I'm roaming the streets with a splattered back  
I'm trying to rap to this freak  
But she can see my ribs all in the street  
Then the chit-chat went dead  
She noticed that I ain't got no head  
Shhh, I think I hear my heart  
But damn, it got hit by a Smark bus  
And landed in Pontiac  
So I tell my mellow to send it back  
Come on, wined and my back blow up  
Look for my guts, look for my guts  
I gotta call from Nate the Mack  
Says he might of found part of my back  
Then bring it on over, ace  
I got slabs all over the place  
But I'm still chillin'  
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling

(Chorus)  
Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween  
People on Military know what this means  
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars  
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars  
I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block  
Spit in my face and gave my a rock  
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""  
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head  
Walked to the next house directly next door  
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor  
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""  
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet  
I ran to the next house happy and giddy  
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty  
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""  
And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick  
Next house up was sittin back in the woods  
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods  
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back  
And then I heard ""COME ON IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT  
This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon  
She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon  
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut  
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts  
I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst  
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst  
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home  
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone  
I walked throught the field, and to the next crib  
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib  
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said How bout instead,  
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread  
My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb  
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb  
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat  
I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street  
Now my bag of candy has doubled in size  
Up to the next house for my scary prize  
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick  
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit  
Rock through his window and ran across the street  
To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat  
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler  
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker  
I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack  
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back  
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready  
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny  
The next house is abandonded so forget it  
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it  
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""  
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died  
The next house is mine the last on the block  
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock  
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady  
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!"" to the whole city

Vibrational booms drying up the lagoons

Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers

Look into the big mirror  
Your reflection is so clear  
Devil's head, rotting flesh  
With the snakes inside your chest  
In the mirror you can't hide  
You've been granted Jacob's lide  
Whipping fear, spinning pain  
All you crying is in vain  
You're the beast you never knew  
This reflects the things you do  
Others starving down the block

Buy a richie home or two

You keep what you could live without  
You're the beast you never knew

Others starving down the block  
Richie's heart is like a rock  
First I grab, then I stab  
Cut you up into a slab  
Grind and twist, flick my wrist  
Toss you in the magic mist  
Look into Halls of Glass  
Every mirror shows the past  
With no love you kick the sin of face  
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors

You should explain to E why ICP should let you live  
As you look on I see this image in your reflection  
A bigot under cover, showing no affections  
To the ghettos and the hoods  
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good  
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow  
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow  
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand  
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand  
And if I were you I'd fear myself  
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth  
You just gotta let em fall

And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?)  
Make him detour to the sore  
And let's wash away his bigot sins  
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends  
And let them see what they really like  
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike  
So look closely in the mirror  
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer  
To live in the hood with the ICP  
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

Only two fans in attendance, these two in my pants

She grabbed by me nuts  
She told me that she loved me then commenced on the sucking  
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear

I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face  
I stuck her with my wang  
I took some Elmer's glue  
I slapped it on her titties and I stuck her to the roof  
And when I came back, I opened up the door  
Her titties were so long they was draggin on the floor  
I stuck her with my wang  
A little two on one  
I told her call a friend over, we can have some fun  
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank

Holy f-ck it's hot outside, extra hot  
The sun is closer then it's ever got  
The sky's polluted, it's raining crud  
Pandemonium throughout the hood  
Every hour the planet shakes  
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes  
Freeways are packed, horns are blowing  
Nobody really knowing where the f-ck they're going  
  
Tidal waves swallowing the shores  
Coffins pushing up through your floors  
It's suddenly freezing, we fall to peices  
Pray for allah and call to Jesus  
Some stay home and hold their wives  
Others flip out and end their lives  
Me, I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out, and sing  
  
It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]  
  
Huh, walking along my path  
The city has morphed into a blood bath  
Some are looting, others shooting  
The devil's in the sky and he's recruiting  
  
Tornados twisting through downtown  
Throwing buses and trucks around  
It's snowing, hailing, and burning up  
I rock my headphones and turn'em up  
Folks dying, crying, dead and crawlin  
Run to the curch, can't fit 'em all in  
Watch the groundscape crack in half  
A bottemless pit down Gratiot ave  
Some stay home and welcome death  
Appreciating each additional breath  
Me, I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out, and sing  
  
It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]

Hurricanes, Earthquakes

Earth shattering

Death with no clue when or why  
The sun explodes and we absorb it  
Our planet spins right out of orbit  
Aliens show up and eat mankind  
A virus spreads with no cure to find  
God has had enough of our shit  
A nuclear war breaks out and that's it  
  
To be on this planet living your life  
To see it all end would be alright  
You can't complain, you wouldn't die alone  
You can die with loved ones and die at home  
And you're not missing anything when you're gone  
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on  
To see this great world come to an end  
Would be the next best to seeing it begin

What's yours is mine it was mines is yours  
Let the wagons of the Dark Carnival show you different worlds  
Any hoes front a juggalos or the hatchet  
Tell them to come suck on your dick, we psychopathic!  
Jamie Madrox:  
All my life I've been living it all alone  
I'm like a king with no people and no crown or a throne  
And what I'm speaking on is what I'm feeling like  
Do you know what it feels like to feel the warmth of the sunlight  
I'd really like to know cause I've been chilling in the dark  
For so many years that I question love in my heart  
And I hate everyone, and I hate everything  
Except for all the juggalos and the love that they bring!  
[Chorus:]  
Marz)  
Let me get your ear and make myself clear  
It's the L Family Juggalos right here  
You can take away my mic you can take away this life  
But this love we got ain't never gonna stop  
We eternal, pass the earthly bullshit  
Dogs on another level can you feel this  
It's Twisted, Blaze and icp,  
And if you're fuckin with my dogs then you D-I-E!  
Violent J:  
If it wasn't for Shaggy my shirt would still be baggy  
I wouldn't be fat, I'd still be hungry and crabby  
We used to buy our own records at the stores  
So they would think it's a hot seller, and order more  
But we built a team of same killers with the same dream  
But we couldn't reach the top, we'd stay B level like Charlie Sheen  
Finally realized we will always have the juggalos  
I'll never give another second, to them other hoes!  
(Chorus x3)  
Lotus!  
Lotus! Lotus! Lotus! Lotus!  
""And they wanted to know if I would trade 10 juggalos for a 100 main stream
fans And I said I wouldn't trade 10 juggalos for a 100, 000 mainstream fans 10
juggalos is priceless to me""  
(Chorus x2 repeats and fades out until song ends)

Cut my finger off again (ah damn!)  
I walk home, tryin' to dodge and hide from thugs,

Did you get your ass stomped again?  
No, yes, ha ha, so?

And if I don't kill them, I keep them in my basement and drill 'em dead

I throw giant ice bergs like snowballs  
I surf tidal wave, drink molten rock

Dealing with these mother fucking idiots  
At subway.  
It's OK, cause now I see behind it and I keep myself

Than me, mother fucker! they just strugglin', in the world they choose.

Carrying the demons soring with the hearts  
I put it in my body, the wind will bring the rain  
Only lay it's demon egg, deep inside my brain

Insane Clown Posse,Miracles,/i/insane+clown+posse/miracles_20873099.html,"If magic is all we've ever know  
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on  
But I've seen miracles in every way  
And I see miracles everyday  
Oceans spanning beyond my sight  
And a million stars way above em at night  
We don't have to be high to look in the sky  
And know that's a miracle opened wide  
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas  
And everything chilling underwater, please  
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog  
Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs  
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people  
All in one room, together as equals  
Pure magic is the birth of my kids  
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids  
The sun and the moon, and even Mars  
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars  
ufos, a river flows  
Plant a little seed and nature grows  
Niagara falls and the pyramids  
Everything you believed in as kids  
fucking rainbows after it rains  
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains  
I fed a fish to a pelican at (Friscal?) bay  
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away  
And music is magic, pure and clean  
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen  
  
Music is all magic  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
You can't even hold it  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
It's just there in the air  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Pure motherfucking magic  
Right?  
This shit'll blow your fucking mind  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
  
Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling  
And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling  
I see miracles all around me  
Stop and look around, it's all astounding  
Water, fire, air and dirt  
fucking magnets, how do they work?  
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist  
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed  
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather  
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together  
And I love my mom for giving me this  
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted  
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly  
Miracles ain't nothing to lie  
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy  
And my little boy looks just like daddy  
Miracles each and every where you look  
And nobody has to stay where they put  
This world is yours for you to explore  
There's nothing but miracles beyond your door  
The Dark Carnival is your invitation  
To witness that without explanation  
Take a look at this fine creation  
And enjoy it better with appreciation  
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast  
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most  
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way  
To ignore the miracles of every day  
  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Magic everywhere in this bitch  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
It's all around you, you don't even know it  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Shit's crazy  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles,  
So many miracles, the magic miracles)  
  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles

Insane Clown Posse,Mr. Johnson's Head,/i/insane+clown+posse/mr+johnsons+head_10144895.html,"[Violent J]  
Sitting in the class with my head on the desk  
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less  
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with  
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same  
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit  
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit  
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying  
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying  
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea  
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her  
Something's happening but it isn't very clear  
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair  
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall  
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall  
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare  
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere  
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted  
But I have a secret everybody missed it  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day  
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway  
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag  
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag  
[Violent J]  
I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong  
But since nobody knows me I got it going on  
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock  
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock  
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me  
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me  
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move  
A dead body rotting in the back of the room  
For weeks and months, stinking up the class  
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus  
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  
But I have a key, it's called insanity  
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
""Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn  
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the  
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all  
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community  
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""  
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""  
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""  
[Violent J]  
No, they can sit and front about it all day  
But I left his fucking body in the hallway  
And in the morning they opened up the door  
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor  
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd  
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard  
I could chop my arms off and run around the class  
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast  
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker  
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter  
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah  
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out  
And the class wanna know who could it be  
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me  
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag  
[Chorus (9x)]

A ten-foot led pipe slapped on my dome  
I'm laying in the street with blood oozing out my head  
Excuse me, motherfucker, was it something I said  
Forks up, forks down, man, forks sideways  
Then he grabbed my finger and he said crime pays  
Swung on his pipe once again for the road  
""Hold up, dawg,"" UH! this shit gets old  
Now I walk the streets with a shattered skull  
I'm gonna swing my axe to his jaw  
Where the motherfucker at? Where the motherfucker stay?  
How ya gonna fuck with the juggla Jay-ay-ay

Pops opened up, pops hit the floor  
Then I chop chop pops twice in his nugget  
Well, he didn't do shit, fuck it

Well, it's me and my mellow mellow roll on Military  
Gangbangers gangbangers, big bang fairy, kinda scary  
Tags up all on the bricks

I don't understand why some people in town  
We witness your water still southwest down  
But this motherfucker gonna try and clown me

Took a shot and he missed, 2 Dope in the dust  
""What I ain't got shot, bitch?"", so now you must  
Take your ticket for the murder go round  
Can't nobody kill a click-clack clown  
Seen him and his boys smoking blunt in a bucket  
Pulled out the dagger creeped up and I stuck it  
Into his head, into his boy's head  
Into his boy's head, his boy's head, his boy's head  
Five dead fucks in the trunk on deliver  
Push that old piece of shit in the river  
The cat and my boys saw five go down  
Can ya get a free ride? (No, not again)  
On the murder go round (No!)

Murder go round, murder go round  
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown?  
  
  
Now I'm in a street gang, fifty-five strong  
Everybody singing that southwest song  
What can go wrong I mean I'm fuckin' in the haugh?  
Popping that shit, I'm gonna bust you in the mouth  
Nobody fucks with a jokero juggalo  
I don't give a fuck ya know, bitches I'm a fuck you though  
But you know the shit had to hit the fan  
Some gangbanger shot me, man  
Twice in the forehead, twice in the back  
Twice in the eye and I'm feeling kinda whack  
Stumbling along it's becoming entwined

After that, your dad will try to jump again  
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin  
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware  
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear  
  
""Now, let's me contestant number two  
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak  
Who works for the Dark Carnival  
He says women call him stretch nuts  
Sharon, let's hear your question""  
  
""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions  
A man who expresses himself in his own special way  
Number two, if you fell in love with me  
Exactly how would you let me know?""  
  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
First thing, I could never love you  
You sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!  
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care  
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here  
I'd go through your phone book and whack em all  
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)  
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay  
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day  
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist  
Let em go, and watch em both spring up in your face  
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can  
Get you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!  
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand  
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin  
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back  
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!  
  
""Well it sounds like contestant number two  
Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon  
It's a touch choice so far  
Sharon, let's have your last question and  
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden""  
  
""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the  
same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would  
your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!""  
  
[Violent J]  
Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar  
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are  
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake  
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake!  
  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick  
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick  
And then to get your attention in the crowded place  
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face  
  
[Violent J]  
Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her  
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better  
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap  
Shit, you don't want contestant number two  
He's mad-whack  
  
[Violent J]  
I walk into a bar and there he was  
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it  
It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama  
Damn dawg! how you gonna diss your momma?!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous  
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus  
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot  
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot  
And I'm sittin in a '64 Reinkeys  
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys  
I look around I can't believe that it's possible  
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival  
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of  
Everybody and they momma got clown luv  
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese,  
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo)  
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers  
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers  
I see my old homey, he died in a drag  
Chillin with two bitches, ""What up, Shaggs?""  
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk  
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it  
And to think, I always been afraid to die  
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why.  
[Chorus (2x)]  
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry  
Even though most never try  
I'm not gonna let this pass me bye, no  
[Violent J]  
I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile  
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while  
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down  
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown  
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top  
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop  
No water, it's Faygo on tap  
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it  
'cause I can, 'cause I'm phat paid  
I got a five story funhouse with a maid  
And she walks around with her titties hanging out  
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo)  
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see  
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E  
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off  
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt  
There's no fights, it's a perfect match  
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to cabbage patch  
And to think, I've always been afraid to die  
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why.  
[Chorus (2x)]  
[Violent J]  
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin? hey  
Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way  
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole  
That's where the greedy skank motherfuckers go

This is all hell now, we livin' in it  
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute  
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden hoes  
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (woo-woo)  
[Violent J]  
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend  
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends  
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad  
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
And for those who ain't down for the next man  
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can  
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something  
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming

Insane Clown Posse,Piggy Pie,/i/insane+clown+posse/piggy+pie_10144824.html,"""Come and get it! Woo!  
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch!  
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""  
  
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood  
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood  
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine  
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine  
I rode into town with my axe in my holster  
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster  
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out  
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out  
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place  
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face  
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half  
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (he he)  
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead  
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head  
Since we out west, I had a little fun  
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium  
  
[Chorus]  
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie  
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die  
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)  
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!  
  
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick  
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick  
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect  
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck  
He walked in the room, and everybody rose  
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes  
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit  
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet  
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?  
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up  
Old-ass man, I let him get away  
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway  
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case  
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face  
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die  
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold  
He lives in a mansion on his own private road  
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait  
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate  
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry  
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky  
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil  
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel  
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals  
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills  
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it  
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it  
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed  
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head  
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late  
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate  
Cause I need  
  
[Chorus: x4]
