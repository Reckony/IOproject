John Denver,Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,/j/john+denver/have+yourself+a+merry+little+christmas_20222057.html,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

John Denver,Healing Time,/j/john+denver/healing+time_20492834.html,"Let the mountains talk  
Let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There is much to learn  
There is much to know  
Much to understand  
In this healing time  
All across the land  
  
You have heard my songs  
Oh so many years  
You have laughed with me  
Washed away my tears  
You have shared my joy  
You have felt my pain  
In this healing time  
Walk with me again  
  
Through these darker days  
On this narrow line  
Help me find my way  
Help me see the signs  
I am not afraid  
I am not alone  
You have taught me well  
You have brought me home  
  
Let the mountains speak  
Let the rivers run  
As the world awakes  
To the rising sun  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
On our mother earth  
  
Let the mountains talk  
And let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There's so much to learn  
In each brand new day

John Denver,I Want To Live,/j/john+denver/i+want+to+live_20073420.html,"There are children raised in sorrow  
On a scorched and barren plain  
There are children raised beneath a golden sun  
There are children of the water  
Children of the sand  
And they cry out through the universe  
Their voices raised as one  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
Have you gazed out on the ocean  
Seen the breaching of a whale?  
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?  
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away  
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar  
For the native and the wanderer in kind  
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son  
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine  
  
We are standing all together  
Face to face and arm in arm  
We are standing on the threshold of s dream  
No more hunger no more killing  
No more wasting life away  
It is simply an idea  
And I know its time has come  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live

only album it has been released on.  
  
I wish I could have been there on the highway  
When the people came from miles around to see  
The children of the flowers come together  
  
I wish I could have been there in the sunshine  
With the sound of lovely laughter in the air  
And the music makers first began to play  
To hear them play  
  
And I wish I could have been there in the rain  
When the clouds were full of castles in the sky  
And I wish I could have heard the people sing  
As the rhytmn and the words came floating by  
  
I wish I could have been there in the starlight  
When the country side was trying once again  
And the music and the makers the poets and the singers  
And the children of the flowers have all gone

John Denver,I'd Rather Be A Cowboy,/j/john+denver/id+rather+be+a+cowboy_10151983.html,"(Lady's Chains)  
Jessie went away last summer, a couple of months ago.  
After all our time together, it was hard to see her go.  
She called me right up when she arrived, asked me one more time to come,  
but living on an LA freeway ain't my kind of having fun.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
When we were just beginning, it was such an easy way.  
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.  
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me,  
she can live the life she wants to, yes, it's all right with me.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
I'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of
concrete and steel.  
I'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some
starry field.  
  
Oh, but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone.  
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.  
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know,  
I love her, yes I love her just enough to let her go.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.

Have you lost your purpose  
The faith that you had

Why look to the ocean  
To wash me away

There goes my last dime

And there's no one there

Keeps rolling on every shore

Like the dark sands of my memory  
When the morning comes  
They are stepping stones to the sun

Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be

I just want to hold you  
I don't want to need you  
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile  
And if the times get rough, being free might be enough  
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm

John Denver,Jenny Dreamed Of Trains,/j/john+denver/jenny+dreamed+of+trains_20073222.html,"This song was first released on the All Aboard! album. It is the only album it
has been released on.  
  
When Jenny was a little girl, she only dreamed of trains  
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things  
Jenny counted boxcars instead of counting sheep  
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep  
  
All she ever talked about was getting on to ride  
She was living in another time you could see it in her eyes  
And every day after school she'd head down to the track  
Waiting for the train that was never coming back  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust  
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust  
No one believed her when she said she heard the train  
Said she was just a little girl acting kind of strange  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Jenny laid a penny on the track one day  
In God we trust she walked away  
The very next morning all she could find  
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains

And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
There's a waiting line forming  
To use the latrine.  
And the sun is just opening the skies.  
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy Newman my radio's on.  
The news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh.  
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.

And the sexy one's here.  
And she tells us such beautiful lies.  
Her uniform's tight.  
Oh her marvelous rear.

And why do you lie there still sleeping.

And we'll let it be such a surprise.

John Denver,Johnny B. Goode,/j/john+denver/johnny+b+goode_10151793.html,"Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens

Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell  
  
[Chorus]  
Go, go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
The engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by would they would stop and say  
Oh my but that little country boy can play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well his mama told him some day you will be a man  
You will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
Just to hear you play your music till the sun go down  
Maybe some day your name will be in lights

John Denver,Kissing You Goodbye,/j/john+denver/kissing+you+goodbye_20924895.html,"Oh, at first it was just like heaven in your heart and in your arms  
And paradise discovered in the sweetness of your charms  
Yes, and every day a miracle to awake and be with you  
And every night in your embrace another dream come true  
Oh, but castles sometimes crumble, some rivers still run dry  
And fairy tales are witches tales when the truth becomes a lie  
And a pocket full of promises won't buy a diamond ring  
And every word you said to me just didn't mean a thing  
It's over now, you've gone too far I can't take anymore  
Be careful now, don't hurt yourself when you walk through the door  
I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Oh, I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way  
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away?  
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand  
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man  
So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all  
The climb to heights of ecstasy, the failure and the fall  
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned  
But no matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned  
Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again  
Kemosabe used to mean ""a good and trusted friend""  
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Bye, bye goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye

Four generations of love on this farm  
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm

Is simply joyful music to me.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you.  
  
So many diff'rent places, a million smiling faces  
Life is so incredible to me  
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you  
Oh paradise was made for you and me.  
  
I know that life goes on just perfectly  
And ev'rything is just the way that it should be  
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking  
And anywhere is where I'd rather be.  
  
Oh and in the night time I know that it's the right time  
To hold you close and say I love you so  
To have someone to share with  
And someone I can care with  
And that is why I wanted you to know  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you, without you.

John Denver,Love Again,/j/john+denver/love+again_20073311.html,"I didn't think it could happen again  
I'm just too old and set in my ways  
I was convinced I would always be lonely  
All of the rest of my days  
Maybe I give up on romance  
In my longing to give up the pain  
I just didn't believe I would ever love again  
  
I was like one who had shut myself in  
Closed the windows, locked all the doors  
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart  
Yet knowing there had to be more  
Though it sounds like a great contradiction  
It's the easiest thing to explain  
You see, I was afraid I might never love again  
  
What does it take for a blind man to see  
That there's more there than just meets the eye  
What are the ways that the magic comes in  
That can turn a song into a sigh  
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming  
Or maybe I'm going insane  
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again  
  
Here I am standing beside you  
Oh life's such a wonderful game  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love

Tryin' to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone

By Brisbane Waters I chance to stray  
I heard a convict his fait bewhaling  
As on the sunny riverbank he lay  
  
I am a native of Erin, Ireland  
But banished now from my native shore  
They stole me from my independence  
And from the maiden whom I do adore  
  
I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie  
At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains  
At Castle Ule and Curstune Garbby  
At all these settlements I've been enchained  
  
But of all places of condemnation  
And penal stations in New South Wales  
To Moreton Bay I have found no equal  
Excessive tyranny each day prevails  
  
For three long years I was beastly treated  
And heavy irons on my legs I wore  
My back from flogging was lacerated  
And oft times covered with my crimson gore  
  
And many a man from downright starvation  
Lies smouldering now beneath the cave  
And Captain Logan he had us mangled  
On the triangles of Moreton Bay  
  
Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews  
We were oppressed under Logan's yoh  
Till a native black lying bare and ambush  
Did deal out tyrant with his mortal stroke  
  
My fellow prisoners be exhilerated  
Let all such monsters like death shall find  
And when from bondage we're extricated  
Our former suffering shall will fade from mind

And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels, or the bright stars a singing.

Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols  
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away  
  
And the coal company came with the world's largest shovel  
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land  
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken  
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County

Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
A kid knows what he wants to be before he's nine or ten  
Cowboys, clowns, and men of war and someone else's friend  
But nine grows into big boys' pants and then to scars and pain  
Twenty's fast and hard as nails but doesn't come again  
  
There's days to fall and days to rise and days for making haste  
Days for seeking out yourself but no days you can waste  
Nighttimes filled with love so good it aches to rest it down  
Endless hallways dark with sleep and rivers dark with sound  
  
Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
Children climbing on my arms and pigeons on my head  
Get thee up my little man and dream a dream instead  
dream a dream of rocking chairs and flying through the night  
Dream until the morning's gone and turned the dark to light  
  
Then come and get your daddy if he hasn't blown away  
Rock him in your children's hands and help him find his way  
Take him to your hiding place and let him come inside  
He'll never tell your secret, cross my heart and hope to die

John Denver,Perhaps Love,/j/john+denver/perhaps+love_20073312.html,"Perhaps love is like a resting place  
A shelter from the storm  
It exists to give you comfort  
It is there to keep you warm  
And in those times of trouble  
When you are most alone  
The memory of love will bring you home  
  
Perhaps love is like a window  
Perhaps an open door  
It invites you to come closer  
It wants to show you more  
And even if you lose yourself  
And don't know what to do  
The memory of love will see you through  
  
Oh, love to some is like a cloud  
To some as strong as steel  
For some a way of living  
For some a way to feel  
And some say love is holding on  
And some say letting go  
And some say love is everything  
And some say they don't know  
  
Perhaps love is like the ocean  
Full of conflict, full of pain  
Like a fire when it's cold outside  
Or thunder when it rains  
If I should live forever  
And all my dreams come true  
My memories of love will be of you

About my life's time  
All the things I've done  
And how it's been  
And I can't help believing  
In my own mind  
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end  
  
I've seen a lot of sunshine  
Slept out in the rain  
Spent a night or two all on my own  
I've known my lady's pleasures  
Had myself some friends  
And spent a time or two all on my own  
  
And I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have a chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long it's been since yesterday  
And what about tomorrow  
And what about our dreams  
And all the memories we share  
  
The days they pass so quickly now  
Nights are seldom long  
And time around me whispers when it's cold  
The changes somehow frighten me  
Still I have to smile  
It turns me on to think of growing old  
For though my life's been good to me  
There's still so much to do  
So many things my mind has never known  
I'd like to raise a family  
I'd like to sail away  
And dance across the mountains on the moon  
  
I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have the chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire

Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams  
All around a pug-nosed dream  
  
The music started and was I the perplexed one  
I held my breath and said  
May I have the next one  
In my frightrnrd arms, polka dots and moonbeams  
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream  
  
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers  
As we floated over the floor  
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers  
And perhaps a few things more  
  
Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter  
I know the meaning of the words ever after  
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams  
When I kiss my pug-nosed dream

It was wrong to do  
I guess that's why I was drawn to you  
Second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time  
  
I feel so alive... it won't last but it's alright  
Fleeting joy and faded ecstasy  
Here goes again, sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree  
Sweet taste of sin  
  
And I'm doing it again  
Yes, I'm doing it again  
Oh, I'm doing it again  
I said it would end  
But here it goes again  
  
This time you told me you saw me at the same motel  
You said you knew me well, and I had that familiar smell  
Asked me, ""How am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you,  
'Cause I know what you're prone to do?""  
Accusations fly like bullets do  
Here it goes again  
Oh, you know me because you're doing it too  
Cycle never ends, it never ends  
  
Oh, you're doing it again  
Yes, you're doing it again  
Are you doing it again?  
You said it would end, but here it goes again and again and again  
  
Damn, I love you, but this is crazy  
I have to fight you, almost daily  
We break up so fast and we, we make up so passionately  
Why can't we just trust each other?  
You can't hate me and be my lover  
Passion ends, the pain begins  
I come back, and we're doing it again  
  
Yes, we're doing it again  
Oh, we're doing it again  
We said it would end  
But here it goes again  
  
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain,  
Saying ""things'll change,"" you'll take away the pain  
Then we flash back to the first time you put your spell on me  
You envelop me, you feel good as hell to me  
One moment leads to another few  
Here it goes again  
Leaving you is oh so hard to do  
I just can't pretend...can't pretend  
  
I keep doing it again  
Oh, I'm doing it again

When you get fooled by smiling faces,

When you get off your trip

A chance to check out the new  
But you're the only one to see  
The changes you take yourself through

But I've never had someone to sing about until I met her

Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody understands me like she

She wants to know how love's supposed to be  
She wants it better,  
I want to let her know she belongs right here with me  
She's heard it all but I'll make her see  
I'll make her fall, make her believe  
I'll promise her that I'll never leave

I know I won't forget that  
But we had some bad times and  
That's time I wish I could get back  
But I love you I can't let go

You been around me long enough  
To know that now it's over.

The scars of your love, remind me of us.  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling...  
We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep  
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the
deep)  
Could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep.  
You had my heart inside of your hand,  
But you played it to the beat.  
Throw your soul through ever ope door (whoa)  
Count your blessings to dins what you look for (whoa -uh)  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.  
(You're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
We could have had it all (tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
It all. (tears are gonna fall)  
It all  
It all (rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you, never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had

And when I'm gone do I truly miss them?

Read the days that weave through the maze  
The seasons so amazing  
Feed them and raised them  
Seasons are aging  
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors  
I want us to get by but  
We're more than consumers  
We more than shooters, more than looters  
Created in this image so God live through us  
And even in this generation, living through computers  
Only love love love can reboot us

Honey, on my mind, you will always find there's only you  
And though you say you'll journey to some foreign land  
I'll remember you, yes, and I'll be true to your memory  
And when at last you do come wandering home to me  
I might look at you but it will be through the weeks between

You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win  
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying  
And woman, it's your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say  
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found

Let it ring down, like bells from heaven  
Let that telephone ring, let it make that call.

Make sure I'm home when that telephone rings.

Won't you hang around and hold me, repeat all the lies you told me?  
Do your rambling after  
Oh Sandy Grey, what ever made you want to stay?  
And now what makes you want to be a-leaving?  
Is it the same thing they found when they laid your father down  
Or are your reasons even worth retrieving?  
Oh Sandy Grey, don't leave me just today

In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble  
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest  
By the foot of yon' mountain  
Lays a clear flowing fountain  
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh  
With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted  
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make  
But he dreamt about sighing  
Lamenting and crying  
Go home to your family and rambling forsake  
'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember  
When first he arrived home to his family and friends  
And they did stand so astounded  
Surprised and dumbfounded  
To see such a stranger once more in their sight  
And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories  
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away  
And he's as happy as those  
As have thousands of riches  
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

And I lived the free life of the rover  
From the murray's green basin to the dusty out back  
I waltzed my matilda all over.  
Then in 1915 my country said ""son  
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done""  
And they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun  
And they sent me away to the war.  
  
And the band played waltzing matilda  
As the ships pulled away from the quay  
And amid all the tears, flag waving and cheers  
We sailed off to galipolli  
  
And how I remember that terrible day  
How our blood stained the sand and the water  
And how in that hell that they called suvla bay  
We were butchered like lambs to the slaughter.  
  
Johnnie turk was ready, oh he primed himself well  
He rained us with bullets and he showered us with shell  
And in five minutes flat we were all blown to hell  
Nearly blew us all back home to australia.  
  
But the band played waltzing matilda  
As we stuck to bury our slain  
We burned ours and the turks buried theirs  
And we started all over again  
  
Those who were living just tried to survive  
In a mad world of blood death and fire  
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive  
While around me the corpses piled higher  
  
Then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head  
And when I awoke in my hospital bed  
And saw what it had done and I wished I was dead  
Never knew there were worse things than dying  
For no more I'll go waltzing matilda  
All round the green bush far and near  
For to hump tent and pegs a man needs both legs  
No more waltzing matilda for me.  
  
They collected the crippled, the wounded, the maimed  
And they shipped us back home to australia  
The armless, the legless, the blind, the insane  
Those proud wounded heroes of suvla  
And as our ship pulled in to circular key  
And I looked at the place where my legs used to be  
I thanked christ there was no one there waiting for me  
To grieve and to mourn and to pity  
  
And the band played waltzing matilda  
As they carried us down the gangway  
But nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared  
And turned all their faces away  
  
So now every April, I sit on my porch  
And I watch the parade pass before me  
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march  
Renewing their dreams of past glory  
  
I see the old men all tired, stiff and sore  
The weary old heroes of a forgotten war  
And the young people ask ""what are they marching for? ""  
And I ask myself the same question  
  
And the band played waltzing matilda  
And the old men still answer the call  
But year after year, the numbers get fewer  
Some day none will march there at all  
  
Waltzing matilda, waltzing matilda  
Who'll come a waltzing matilda with me  
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong  
Who'll come a waltzing matilda with me.

As his mind wanders back to the first time he held her  
He looks at her now, the same pride in his eyes  
As onto the dance floor they glide  
This is the dance of the bride and her father  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
On this your wedding day  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
You'll soon be going away  
I loved you since you first began  
Now you've found a new man  
But I love you so, and this you must know  
That my love won't falter  
So dance with me daughter  
Beautiful daughter of mine  
  
We walk down the aisle  
On my face there's a smile  
But deep in my heart there's a tear  
Our friends and relations are here in the church  
With smiles on their faces they stare  
As we walk t'ward the man who has stolen your heart  
And to whom I must give you away  
But I wish you love and happiness too  
On this your wedding day  
  
Chorus  
The dance has begun  
We twirl around the floor  
But I know you're not my little girl anymore  
A lovely young woman has taken her place  
And there's happiness written all over her face  
But always remember although we must part  
You may leave my arms but never my heart

Don't be frightened by the night  
Just let me be your guardian angel  
You will be my guiding light  
  
We've been on this road so long  
And sometimes not know where we are  
That's when I'd be your lost horizon  
You would be my Shangri La  
  
Praise slips out so easily  
It may not sound sincere  
But it only seems to come to me  
Whenever you are near  
  
So thank you for the joy ou bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
I'll always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
When the sun is far too strong  
When the wind is cold as ice  
That's when I'll be your life's oasis  
You will be my paradise  
  
So thank you for the joy you bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
I'll always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
Yes I'll always be your guardian angel  
As long as you'll be my guiding light

Changing my life with a wave of her hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
There running my hands through her hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there  
  
I want here everywhere  
And if she's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there and everywhere  
Here there and everywhere  
I will be there and everywhere

John McDermott,Kathleen,/j/john+mcdermott/kathleen_20074416.html,"Kathleen : to pan and terry  
Blown like a leaf on a warm summer breeze  
A vision approached me as cool as you please  
With her strawberry hair and a wink in her eye  
To say I was smitten would not be a lie  
Gathering courage I started to speak  
To ask of her name but my heart felt too weak  
Like I'd gone to heaven before I had died  
I mumbled the question she calmly replied 'kathleen'  
Well I remember my first motorbike  
With her riding pillion I'd not heard the like  
Of her giggles and squeels as we leaned left and right  
And feeling her arms round my chest holding tight  
Whilrwind romances were never my speed  
But this one took off like a runaway steed  
When she said she was having the time of her life  
I knew then this vision would soon be my wife, kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Thinking there's safety in numbers no doubt  
Acounts for the fact that the wholw town turned out  
To behold how serenely she walked down the aisle  
But trembled and blushed as I kissed her sweet smile  
Picnics on beaches and punts on the lake  
Luck seemed to serve us a slice of life's cake  
That was more than enought to sustain us through years  
When laughter would somehow give way to some tears kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Then at the ball she looked ever so sweet  
Heavy with child but still light on her feet  
Every head turned our way as we whirled o'er the floor  
And I love her more than I'd loved her before  
(instrumental)  
Two caring children siobhan and marie  
A grand little grandchild to bounce on my knee  
They're a fine testimonial to all that was right  
In keeping our candle of love burning bright, kathleen  
Now as my life nears it's own eventide  
It's almost as though she were here by my side  
Such a presence an aura so perfectly made  
My beautiful vision that never will fade kathleen

Of the last two island swans.

With no beginning and no end  
With his lady by his side

Young and free as the island breeze

With the seering cold that starts  
Stalked the hunter with his bow  
And put an arrow through her heart

He was brave but he lay low  
By her body in the isle of mist  
I saw her give him one last cold kiss  
One last cold kiss  
  
Now swans like people  
Talk of only one in this fair side  
Though they brought him 20 ladies  
He would take no other bride  
  
And they say he will not move  
From the place where she did fall  
Once so proud he's beaten now  
And he will not rise at all

On the Champs-Elysees, lovers walking hand in hand

When they take one look at me and seem to understand  
This city of light is a lovely sight  
But the first bright star I see tonight

Drinking cheap champagne  
Wondering how two people got so far apart

Here in London where the rain is pouring down

Old men go fishing with black line and spoon  
And if they catch nothing they never complain  
I wish I was with them again  
As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore  
Teasing the one that they really adore  
And into the evening the courting begins  
I wish I was with them again

Can you imagine a piece of the universe  
More fit for princes and kings?  
I'll give you ten of your cities  
For Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings  
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights  
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight  
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends  
I wish I was with them again  
And over the ashes the stories are told  
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold  
The stars on the river they sparkle and spin  
I wish I was with them again  
Chorus  
Out on the Mira the people are kind  
They'll treat you to home-brew and help you unwind  
And if you come broken they'll see that you mend  
I wish I was with them again  
And thus I conclude with a wish you go well  
Sweet be your dreams, may your happiness swell  
I'll leave you here, for my journey begins  
I'm going to be with them, going to be with them  
I'm going to be with them again

I hear that you're planning on leaving from here  
And I fear that it's true there's a great empty space  
Faces are crying all over the place  
Stay mary stay  
Tears and the rain and the dew occupy  
The valley sweet mary where you say goodbye  
Now while under the rain I was told by a fish  
Sweet mary your plan to allow me one wish  
Stay mary stay  
The sun never shines o'er this valley  
The mountains are crying all day  
The trees never change from the autumn  
Since mary said mary can't stay away, away, away  
Sweet sister mary the church closed the doors  
The men's brooms are sweeping the tears from the floors  
And I know you'll be missed but I think we'll survive  
Mary sweet mary may I say good-bye  
Bye mary bye

Margaret brings him breakfast  
She believes him

But Margaret only sees that sometimes

In his eyes

Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee

And dear Margaret remembers for me.  
  
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes  
His cap and his coat are patched with love  
That Margaret sewed in  
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam  
  
He watches tug boats down canals  
And calls out to them  
When he thinks he knows the captain  
Til Margaret comes to take him home again  
Through unforgiving streets  
A tripping though she holds his arm.  
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone  
And calls her name

The windmills swirl. The winter air  
She winds his muffler tighter  
They sit in the kitchen  
And the tea with wiskey keep away the dew  
He sees her for a moment, calls her name  
She makes his bed up  
Humming some old love song.  
She learned it when the tune was vey new  
He hums a line or two, they hum together in the night

When a fella walked up and said

Stuck me three times in the chest  
And I died that night

They say people get what they deserve  
But Lord, sometimes it's much worse than that  
Maryanne, she takin' in some laundry  
I got a part time job in a drive-in stand  
Oh Lord, what did I do  
To deserve these empty hands?  
  
Across the cities  
Across this land  
Through the valleys  
And across the sand  
Too many people standing in line  
Too many people with nothing planned  
There's too many people with  
Empty hands  
  
Now Maryanne's been cryin' Lord knows, I love her the best I can  
When my pride is bruised and broken  
She slips her hand into my empty hands  
Without hope, without love  
You've got nothing but pain  
Just makes a man not give a damn  
That's no way for us to live  
We've got to fill these empty hands  
  
Across the cities  
Across this land  
Through the valleys  
And across the sand  
Too many people standing in line  
Too many people with nothing planned  
There's too many people with  
Empty hands

And every word that you had  
I was looking up to you for a reason

And you say, ?Hey man, I was only teasing?  
And the rhyme is no longer in time  
And all the words are not the words you been needin'

And now you think to yourself, what is left for tomorrow  
And it seems kinda strange there's nothing left to gain  
And nothing left to borrow  
And the mistake your about to make  
Will be the final take of your sorrow

Everybody in the whole cell block

Well sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone  
  
When over in the corner weepin' all alone.  
The warden said, ""buddy, don't you be no square.  
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.""  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block

Well Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake,  
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break.""  
  
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix,

And when I go to sleep at night  
I got no sheets on my bed

I see people coming and going  
But I ain't a got no friends

Into the darkness of night  
My head gets to spinning  
So I shut out the light  
I don't care if I see tomorrow  
If I had a reason I'd pretend  
I know one thing for certain  
I ain't a got no friends  
  
Well one of these days my anger  
Get the best of my soul  
In one desperate moment  
I'm gonna dig me a hole  
I'm gonna lie down in it  
And let be what will be  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me  
  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me

He said I'm old kind of worn out inside  
I worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary  
And my father before me I helped build this land  
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness  
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands  
My family and friends are the best thing I've known  
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams

You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming  
He said ""son it sounds like rattling old bones""  
This highway is long but I know some that are longer  
By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home  
Through the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river  
The old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times  
He fell asleep with his head against the window  
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind  
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings

And sometimes I need some good old company  
  
And then I'll be with Sugar Marie

Come on, dance with me, Sugar Marie  
And she don't ask me any questions, she don't flirt with the other boys  
She belongs to me Sugar Marie, Sugar Marie  
  
I never thought I needed no one  
I can make a big enough mess myself  
Oh, but when I finally found someone  
And she made me forget myself  
  
Dance with me Sugar Marie  
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Shake that thang for me, Sugar Marie  
But she don't ask me any questions when it's time to leave

You just cop someone else's ideas  
And masturbate yourself, make them your own

And she played on a steel guitar  
And the drifters did come and they'd go  
And she'd put on her crown

And some drifters would stay here the night

Her body was tan  
From the afternoons by the public swimming pool

In a big hotel down in Austin, Texas

Still acted like we were kids  
And she told me that she had to marry  
And she asked me if I did

Scandal in the White House  
An election is what we need  
From coast-to-coast to Washington  
  
So America voted on a president  
No one kept count  
On how the election went  
From Florida to Washington  
  
Goddamn, said one side  
And the other said the same  
Both looked pretty guilty  
But no one took the blame  
From coast-to-coast to Washington  
  
So a new man in the White House  
With a familiar name  
Said he had some fresh ideas  
But it's worse now since he came  
From Texas to Washington  
  
And he wants to fight with many  
And he says it's not for oil  
He sent out the National Guard  
To police the world  
From Baghdad to Washington  
  
What is the thought process  
To take a humans life  
What would be the reason  
To think that this is right  
From Heaven to Washington  
From Jesus Christ to Washington

Well I get up in the morning  
Have a smoke, have a drink  
Then I get dressed  
I don't want to get to work too late  
'Cause that bossman he's a real mean son-of-a-bitch  
Everything is so fast and so crazy  
But the day still slowly slips on by  
And when that five o'clock whistle starts to blow  
I'll be gone in a wink of an eye  
  
Chorus  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
And that long haired girl will be smiling  
When she sees me walkin' in  
Well all right, she looks so good  
That she just hasta be a sin  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
  
We'll walk over to the East Street Montgomery Pier  
She says she likes holding something dangerous  
She pulls me close and whispers in my ear  
She says, ""Come here little boy  
I'll put my pussy right on your face  
Because my fever is runnin' hot and high  
And you're the boy that makes me feel like I'm alive""

Carrying the same heavy load

The other man's belly full of unbearable pain

Ten million rows to hoe

He'd prove he could run  
Twice as fast as the sun  
By losing his shadow at night  
Now he loved every girl  
In this curly headed world  
But no one will know it seems  
For two twisted legs and a childhood disease  
Left Billy just a bum in his dreams  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now he lived all alone in a run down home  
Near the side of the old railroad track  
Where the trains used to run  
Carryin' freight by the ton  
Blow the whistle as Billy'd wave back  
But the children around Billy's home town  
Seemed to have nothin' better to do  
Then run around his house  
With their tongues from their mouth  
Make fun of that crippled old fool  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now some folks they wait and some folks they pray  
For Jesus to rise up again  
But none of these folks in their holy cloaks  
Ever took Billy on as a friend  
For pity's a crime  
And it ain't worth a dime  
To a person who's really in need  
Just treat 'em the same  
As you would your own name  
Next time that your heart starts to bleed  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning

On a cold winter's morning to a church house  
Just to shovel some snow.

An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter  
Just from walking with his back turned  
To the train that was coming so slow.  
  
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,  
Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter? ""  
But it don't do no good to get angry,  
So help me I know  
  
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.  
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there  
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own  
Chain of sorrow.

I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair  
And my head shouted down to my heart  
""you better look out below!""

All the women in Memphis  
Want to see how long my money will last

I'm gonna beat on my guitar  
And strut all around the stage

Don't tell her that her daddy's in jail  
If you see my baby coming  
Don't you tell her that her daddy's in jail  
She'd sell her little pumpkin just to raise  
Her sweet daddy's bail  
  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You never do nothing  
To save your doggone soul.

So no one in the world will see  
  
And we'll make love  
While we watch the flame  
Then we'll walk away  
As if we never had no shame  
  
Now we must hide  
To be alone  
And we can't say  
Our sweet things on the telephone  
  
If we can't stop  
What we've begun  
We should say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done

Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.  
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade  
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray

Lydia  
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.  
  
Chorus:  
But dreaming just comes natural  
Like the first breath from a baby,  
Like sunshine feeding daisies,  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.  
  
Bunk beds, shaved heads, saturday night,  
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.  
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:  
  
(spoken:)  
Donald  
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.  
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.  
  
[Repeat chorus:]  
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.  
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.  
Donald and lydia made love that night.  
  
(spoken:)  
Love  
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,  
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,  
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

While the bridges brightly burn  
So far away from my land  
The valley of the unconcerned  
  
I was walking down the road, man  
Just looking at my shoes  
When God sent me an angel  
Just to chase away my blues  
  
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds  
Just flying through the sky  
And they seemed to form a teardrop  
From a black haired angel's eye  
  
That tear fell all around me  
And it washed my sins away

But it weren't just the music playing

On the hill where the angels sing

In the parking lot dirt

And I wished for once I weren't right  
Why we used to laugh together  
And we'd dance to any old song  
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me  
But she waits just a second to long

With shoes on my feet

If I'm gonna see tomorrow.

For what we must do  
You forgive us

Till we both turn blue  
Then we'll whistle and go fishing

On a monkey wrench

And give the girls a pinch  
But I don't think

Eat everything  
That they put on your dish  
And when we get through  
We'll make a big wish  
That we never have  
To do this again  
Again? again????  
  
On my very first job  
I said thank you and please  
They made me scrub a parking lot  
Down on my knees  
Then I got fired  
For being scared of bees  
And they only give me  
Fifty cents an hour.

When all your friends have flown  
Who'll be around to want you  
When all your loves have gone  
Only a fool would do it  
After the way you've done  
But how many fools would have you I know one  
  
This fool keeps wonderin' why  
He fell in love at all  
But you might need this fool  
Around in case you fall  
  
After the party's over  
And you've had your fill of fun  
If you need a fool to forgive you I know one  
  
You never know, you might be lonely  
When all your loves have missed  
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra  
Fool on your list.  
  
After your heart's been broken  
And you need a place to run  
If you'll take a fool who loves you  
I know one  
I know one  
I know one

Like a bump on a log  
Mind all your manners  
Be quiet as a mouse

Knocks his old balls  
Round the old golf course

She smokes like a chimney  
And drinks like a fish

With a head like a rock  
I wished I had a woman  
That made my knees knock

And eat like a bird  
And if I wrote a song  
She'd know ever single word  
  
Kiss a little baby  
Give the world a smile  
If you take an inch  
Give 'em back a mile  
Cause if you lie like a rug  
And you don't give a damn

That you don't realize  
Loose lips sink ships, shake hips  
Bad tips draw spies  
I want you when I can get you  
But you only want me on the rise  
Well I thought I had your number  
But your number's too loud  
Now you're standing on the table  
And we're drawing a crowd  
Let's stop  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these spies

Greeting smile after smile

Strings of streetlights even Stop Lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Here the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
It Santa's big day

To the old far eastern war  
And it was foreign to his body  
It was foreign to his shore  
So he traded in the present  
For the better times he'd seen  
And made an oriental waitress  
His own home comin' queen

And a big trip that they took  
Well, I heard all about in a restaurant  
And I read it in a history book  
They rented a car at the Erie Canal  
But the car didn't have no brake  
Said ma to pa ""My God this car  
Is gonna fall into the bottomless lake""  
Well, mama turned to daddy with a pale face  
Said ""I've done something horribly wrong  
Well, the waters still runnin' in the bathtub  
And I think I left the kitchen light on""  
Then I heard a crash, the car when splash  
The compass rolled around and around  
Oh, for Heaven's sake! We fell in a lake  
And I think we're all gonna drown  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
There was plenty of food in the backseat  
And the windows were rolled up tight  
So we all nibbled on a chicken leg  
Told stories way through the night  
Well, pa told one that he told before  
And the baby got a bellyache  
Said ma to pa ""My God this car's  
Falling down a bottomless lake""  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
Well papa played the music on the radio  
Mama rocked the baby to sleep  
He said, he would've taken the other road  
But he didn't think the lake was that deep  
Well, if the ferry had been there at the end of the pier  
We'd be half way to Uncle Jake's  
Instead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
'Stead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground

So if you're ever goin' on a big trip  
You better be careful out there  
Start everything on your good foot  
Wear clean underwear  
Take along a Bible in the backseat  
Read of David and Solomon  
For if you make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake

Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer  
And she worked in a juke box saloon  
And she spent all the money that I give her  
Just to see the old man in the moon  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings  
To the drive-in on Route 41  
And it was there that I first suspected  
That she was doin' what she'd already done  
She said, ""Johnny won't you get me some popcorn""  
And she knew I had to walk pretty far  
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight  
She hopped into a foreign sports car

And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes

Well you know I could have beat up that fellow  
But it was her that had hopped into his car  
Many times I'd fought to protect her  
But this time she was goin' too far  
Now some folks they call me a coward  
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night  
But I'd rather have names thrown at me  
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Now she writes all the fellows love letters  
Saying ""Greetings, come and see me real soon""  
And they go and line up in the barroom  
And spend the night in that sick woman's room  
But sometimes I get awful lonesome  
And I wish she was my girl instead  
But she won't let me live with her  
And she makes me live in my head

Through this land  
Rolling aimlessly along

Written in the words  
Of dead men's songs.  
Down through the years  
Many men have yearned  
For freedom  
Some found it  
Only on the open road  
So many tears of blood  
Have fell around us  
'cause you can't always do what you are told.  
Please tell me where  
Have all the hobos gone to  
I see no fire burning down  
By the rusty railroad track  
Could it be that time  
Has gone and left them  
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.  
Last Sunday night  
I wrote a letter  
To my loved one  
I signed my name  
And knew I'd stayed away  
Too long  
There was a time  
When my heart was free to wander  
And I remember as I sing  
This hobo song.

One jumped and screamed you lose

I seen them cats doing the ubangi stomp  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that's ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well, I looked up the chief and he invited me in  
Said a heap big jam session 'bout to begin  
He handed me a tom-tom I picked up the beat  
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet  
Rocked and rolled and I skipped with a smile  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that's ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well, we rocked all night and part of the day  
Had a good rocking time with the chief's daughter mae  
I was making time and gettin' in the know  
The captain said son we gotta go.  
I said that's alright. you go on ahead  
I'm gonna ubangi stomp until I roll over dead  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll

All the good I've done  
If you loved me  
Tell you what I would do  
Wrap the world in silver foil  
Bring it home to you  
  
Lately, I feel  
That I can't pretend  
I may never, ever see  
The likes of you again  
I take a walk, I come back home  
Then I sit a spell  
Watch the ponies dance around  
The empty wishing well  
  
Night has fallen  
I've said the things I did  
The only baby sleeping  
Is when I was a kid  
Do you remember

It's everybody's fight  
And the street lamp said as he nodded his head  
It's lonesome out tonight

John Prine,You Never Even Call Me By My Name,/j/john+prine/you+never+even+call+me+by+my+name_20492513.html,"[spoken] This is a song I wrote with John Prine 4 years ago (1972) and we
tried to put into one song, everything that had ever been in any of the
country and western songs we had ever heard. Tried to put it all into one
song. Serves us right. This is what came out:  
  
Well it was all I could do to keep from cryin'  
Some times it seems so useless to remain  
You're the one who always tried to change me  
And that is why I will always stay the same  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name  
  
No, you don't have to call me Freddy Fender  
You don't have to call me Charlie Pride  
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though you know you're on my fighting side  
  
Chorus- this verse only:  
And I'm gonna hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain (when nights are cold and lonely)  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by name.  
  
[musical by mouth improv done in a Merle Haggard-like tone -no words]  
  
[spoken] I've seen my name, a few times in the phone book  
[spoken] And on the neon sign above the bar I used to own  
[spoken] And there's only one thing I'm really sure of was that sucker  
You're gonna hear it when my savior calls me home  
  
[spoken] That's a lot to get into one song. We left out all the good stuff.
Dallas, dope, divorce, dead dogs, trains prison Christmas, mothers, farms, and
trucks. Mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms, Christmas, and dead dogs are
essential, you can't have a good country song without them things. And with
all due respect this song needs mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms,
Christmas and dead dogs and is that it? Whatever it is - it's also 4 minutes
long already (they're going 'when's he gonna end, when's he gonna end in the
booth back there') So I'll just tack this verse on the end here-  
  
Ever since the dog died and mama went to prison  
Ain't nothin' round this old farm that's been the same  
[Spoken] You know when mom broke out last Christmas  
She drove the getaway laundry truck into a train  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'

When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what I'm living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin'  
If you won't take me now  
Don't take me anymore

Around a memory""

I hear she found it on St. Mark's

And shoot their mouths off shooting sparks

Battle hymns and hit parades  
Armageddon cascades

Til the sun shines again  
Got nothing but a uniform  
General issue and rules that I will warn  
On my name tags are sewn  
Serial number stamped across my name  
My fate is decided by kangaroo court

Tin soldiers marching in flame

Until the sun shines again  
There's no phoenix rising  
And the future's stillborn  
Dark shadows are dancing  
My coat of colors is torn  
In Euro  
Yeah, oh.  
Supernova on the Baltic Sea  
Push button logic dehumanizing me  
And it gets a lot like TV  
We've got children starving in the streets  
Genocide's the fashion  
And no man withstands its heat  
Kings and pawns all compete  
First gets the oil and the gold  
Outside my window  
Clouds fill my sky

You'll be gone when I wake up  
To the Rolling Stones  
And the jukes and earls  
  
But I ain't looking for  
An imaginary girl  
Who are you really?  
Come on tell me  
  
Deep behind blue eyes  
And what's on today's agenda  
In your enterprise  
Do you weigh the odds before you speak  
  
Straighten out your curls  
But I'm not taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
Yeah  
  
Who are you trying to be  
Why are you so counterfeit  
What's your problem  
Who do you want to be anyway  
  
'Cause I need reality  
That's right  
Come on be straight with me  
You're like a damaged nerve  
  
You're like a dirt road curve  
Do you think you have to act  
Like your someone else with me  
'Cause I don't believe you  
  
You're an imaginary girl  
Don't believe you babe  
Thought I saw you once  
When you just let go  
  
And took your heart down off the shelf  
When you turned around and looked at me baby  
You were nobody else  
That's what I'm looking for deep inside of you  
  
That hidden precious pearl  
Not the act of love  
From an imaginary girl  
I can't buy into your imaginary world  
  
Yeah  
Won't be taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
So who are you saving it for  
  
In your imaginary world  
Yeah  
I guess I'm resigned to an imaginary girl  
I'm in love with an imaginary girl

John Waite,In God's Shadow,/j/john+waite/in+gods+shadow_20074924.html,"We speak out like children

These rights we hold precious  
Say it loud enough  
And it'll be true  
In the company of strangers  
Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
We speak revolution  
But the future's already been sold  
The masters of diffusion  
Spinning their fine webs into gold  
And the party's just begun  
This matter of resistance  
Our ship was built to last  
We're sailing out on troubled seas  
Nail your colors to the mast  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
The avenue is so crowded  
And they're turning up the heat  
And the red lights keep on flashing  
Out there tonight on Bourbon Street

Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass

On an old guitar for my new life  
For the playwright and the printer

They're on a permanent vacation  
Like butterflies in killing jars

Time is short so let's start running  
To hell with pride

Don't it make you feel complete

Then sweeps you right off your feet  
  
Time stands still for two lovers  
And it's intangible  
But it hits like steel  
It stops me in my tracks  
  
Makes my private world unsealed  
A crashed car  
A communication failsafe

In fact we've got no choice  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
Ain't it something else  
  
Like skydiving into Shangri-la  
And the clearest cool is the zeal-blue heaven  
And you can't quite put your finger on it  
And you could be anywhere  
  
Anytime anyplace in your lover's arms  
Could be paradise or walkin' on thin ice  
We can share this vision  
We're on some one-way street  
  
Exchanging cigarettes and glances  
We both feel the heat  
It's a love collision  
Love collision  
  
There's no decision  
It's a love collision  
If I close my eyes  
Visualizing you and I somewhere in this city  
  
And moments of desire  
The steady the silent gaze of lovers transfixed  
We could share this vision  
In fact we've got no choice  
  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
It's a love collision  
Love collision

I need more  
Just give me one good reason

In this uncertain world of circumstance  
With one foot in the door  
At the house of truth  
That's burnt down to the floor  
I want more  
Yeah  
I need more  
In my days  
Tripping down the turnpike somewhere  
Out there near the shore  
Looking for some words to live by  
In the uncertain moments in the loam  
You can almost hear it shine  
Is that voice I'm hearing divine  
Cause I hear more  
I hear more  
Just give me one good reason  
What I'm living for

Only innocence is pure

You'll hear inside my heart of hearts

And darling the words get in the way  
The poet sees the world through rhymes  
But only says so much  
See darling, the words are in my touch  
The meaning's in my touch  
And maybe there's something I should say  
To make everything that's wrong Ok  
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play  
But a man can only say so much these days  
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake  
Trying to make good on our past mistakes  
And I know you're tired

I will give you the matches  
I will make you complete

I won't ask you again  
I can give you the hopes of a younger man  
In the night we can hear  
I'm your friend and what's more  
  
I will give you what you've been looking for  
Yes I can give you what you've been looking for

Should I take it  
  
Should I go or should I stay?

With fire in my heart and you along beside me  
We'll burn down all the schools

The world was ours together  
And all the things we had  
Were cast up in the future baby  
How could things turn out bad?  
  
Now I ain't waiting for  
Those days to return  
You showed me what love was  
I had such a lot to learn

I never knew a love so fine (When you were mine)

When you were mine (When you were mine)  
  
7 Days a week  
365 a year  
We tripped the wild fantastic edge  
The truth was always clear  
  
They could never tame our wild hearts  
Or stop us making love  
We were so inseparable  
We could never get enough  
  
And it seems like only yesterday  
You made my world turn  
And these days I think about ya  
The fire still burns

But everytime I think of it baby  
  
I just have to laugh

On my own  
Looking at my watch and thinking how time's flown  
  
Come back baby

And we can break a bottle of that elderberry wine

In order for the beer truck to come through  
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie  
Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude  
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties  
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song  
There were women who once did and some who still would

Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will  
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din  
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in  
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill  
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still  
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been  
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in  
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day  
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play  
When we step across the river where mother so long has been  
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)

As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow  
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation  
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation  
After the US revolution corn planter was a chief  
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief  
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed  
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined  
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand  
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now  
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how  
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam  
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam  
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin  
It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim  
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground  
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south  
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth  
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site  
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right  
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way  
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay  
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea  
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring  
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling  
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time  
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine  
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill  
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill  
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow  
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow  
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you
thirsty)  
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass

At the people passin' by

Is the beer that's in his belly  
Or the tear that's in his eye

""Now"" she said

He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
  
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it and as he grew  
He said, I'm gonna be like you, Dad  
You know I'm gonna be like you  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
My son turned ten just the other day,  
He said ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play  
Can you teach me to throw?"", I said  
""Not today, I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's okay""  
  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
He said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm gonna be like him""  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
He came from college just the other day  
So much like a man, I just had to say  
""Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head, and said with a smile  
  
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See ya later, can I have them please?""

I don't know when but we'll get together then, Dad

Now I've retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said, ""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""  
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time  
My new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu  
But it's nice talkin' to you Dad, it's sure nice talkin' to you""  
  
As I hung up the phone it occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me  
My boy was just like me  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Son?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then Dad

Mama called us together and mama tried to smile  
She said you know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year  
There's just no spending money and well at least we're all here  
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents  
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat  
That's quite a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant  
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were  
At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her  
Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me  
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread  
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed  
Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean  
But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things  
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then  
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him  
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks  
And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from
town  
A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us  
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk  
And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil  
A log apples cranges and such  
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found  
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down  
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door  
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said  
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door  
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back  
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light  
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night  
Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent  
Then daddy put on his gumboots waited for the thaw back home in Dyess Arkansas

Ninety nine years underneath that ground

You'll come and find the place where I am lying.  
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.  
  
And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me  
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be.  
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me  
And I will rest in peace until you come to me.

And laid his money down

I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart  
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same  
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain  
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money  
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine  
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me  
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again  
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore  
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain  
Dorraine, I called Dorraine  
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain  
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine  
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start  
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain  
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all  
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine  
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain  
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain  
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine

Or someone's life sun going down, down, down?  
  
Field of diamonds in the sky, silent beauty shining high.  
Are you tears the angels cry? Field of diamonds in the sky.

And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and the endless sky my love  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move through my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
I felt your heart so close to mine  
And I know our joy would fill the earth  
And last 'till the end of time my love

And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown  
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen  
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar and there's forty shades of green

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churching surf

Guess I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

But he was her man nearly all of the time  
Well Johnny he packed up to leave her but he promised he'd be back  
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track  
He said ""I'm your man I wouldn't do you wrong""  
Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinkin' about her man  
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band  
He was Frankie's man he wasn't doin' her wrong  
Then in the front door walked a redhead Johnny saw her right away  
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played  
He was Frankie's man but she was far away  
He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him  
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim  
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none  
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him  
She slapped him a time or two  
She said ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you""  
If you're her man you better treat her right  
Well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick  
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick  
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

Hank and Joe and me walked on

For days and days we fought the heat  
I got so thirsty and I got so weak  
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go  
I heard Hank say to Joe  
He's dyin'

For water  
Hear him cryin'

For water  
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said  
Joe you know he's a dyin' man  
Leave him there and let him die

Buzzards circled miles ahead  
I knew Hank and Joe were dead  
My eyes were dimmed but I could see  
A bed of gold nuggets under me  
Now I know that it won't be long  
Till they decorate my bones

Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

He worked eighteen years on the assembly line  
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime  
And that could be the end of this story of mine but it's just the beginning  
Late one night when he was workin' graveyard Harley got himself this big  
idea  
All he's have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a  
year  
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop  
Money started rollin' in like it wasn't gonna stop  
So Harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top  
So the losers could see whom was winnin'  
Only in America with nothin' but a dream only in America where every man's  
king  
  
First Harley's daughter Janet found a guru she gave him everything she  
owned  
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband  
And walked around all day about half stoned  
His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored  
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored  
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord  
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a  
happy ending  
Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea  
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a  
year  
Now Harley's back working the assembly line  
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime  
But don't count Harley out cause he ain't the quittin' kind  
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind  
How to make them things more user-friendly  
Only in America

Johnny Cash,Here Was A Man,/j/johnny+cash/here+was+a+man_20220047.html,"(Joy to the world the Lord is come)  
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant
woman  
He grew up in another small village  
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  
  
Then for three years he was a traveling minister  
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  
And where he did go he usually walked  
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  
  
Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big
city  
Yes here was a man  
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  
  
Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  
  
Then he went through the mockery of a trial  
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  
For the only piece of property that he had in this world  
  
And that was his robe his purple robe  
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  
  
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race  
Our leader in the column to human destiny  
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever
marched  
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  
  
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever
reigned  
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  
So powerfully as that one solitary life  
Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)

You always said that, that should be my middle name

And it don't even have to look much like a cell

And not a single word was spoken  
I must have pushed him, but I don't remember why?  
And all at once, he lay there broken  
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't  
But like my shame, that kind of love is always hidden  
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head  
They never got me for the thing I really did  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?

Along the coach roads I did ride  
With sword and pistol by my side  
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade  
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade  
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five  
But I am still alive.  
  
I was a sailor.  
I was born upon the tide  
And with the sea I did abide.  
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico  
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow  
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed  
But I am living still.  
  
I was a dam builder.  
Across the river deep and wide  
Where steel and water did collide  
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado  
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below  
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound  
But I am still around  
I'll always be around  
And around and around and around and around.  
  
I fly a star ship.  
Across the Universe divide  
And when I reach the other side  
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can  
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again  
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain  
But I will remain  
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

Throw my ashes to the wind

Crossing the plain

Across the land

High up in the chair  
Explain to the court room  
What went through your mind  
And we'll ask the jury  
What verdict they find

Of death over life

To see what they'd done  
And we'll ride together

Too little for a cotton sack

Til they couldn't straighten their backs

When I was big enough to run  
That I'd never stay a single day  
In that Oklahoma sun

And that the farm couldn't hold me then so I stole ten bucks  
And a pickup truck  
And I never went back again  
Then it was fast cars and whiskey  
Long haired girls and fun  
I had everything that money could bring  
And I took it with a gun

It was Saturday night in Memphis  
When a redneck grabbed my shirt  
When he said go back to your cotton sack  
I left him dying in the dirt

To the gallos just outside  
And in the time I got

Took a man on a mountainside  
Pretty house by the water  
Lovely lover by the waterside  
Last time I saw that man  
He hung down his head and cried  
  
Corrina, Corrina  
Do you have to go  
Corrina, Corrina  
Tell me why do you have to go  
Just made me come to love you girl  
Now you pack your things and go  
Leave me this bird that whistles  
Leave me this bird that sings  
  
I got a bird that whistles  
I got a bird that's singin'  
If I don't have you darlin'  
Birds don't mean nothin'

Joni Mitchell,A Case Of You,/j/joni+mitchell/a+case+of+you_20075257.html,"Just before our love got lost you said  
""I am as constant as a northern star"" and I said,  
""Constantly in the darkness  
Where's that at?  
If you want me I'll be in the bar""  
  
On the back of a cartoon coaster  
In the blue TV screen light  
I drew a map of Canada  
Oh Canada  
With your face sketched on it twice  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling and I would  
Still be on my feet  
Oh I would still be on my feet  
  
Oh I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I'm frightened by the devil  
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid  
I remember that time that you told me, you said  
""Love is touching souls""  
Surely you touched mine 'cause  
Part of you pours out of me  
In these lines from time to time  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
I met a woman  
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life  
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said  
""Go to him  
stay with him if you can  
But be prepared to bleed""  
  
Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine  
You're so bitter  
bitter and so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet

Joni Mitchell,A Chair In The Sky,/j/joni+mitchell/a+chair+in+the+sky_20075400.html,"The rain slammed hard as bars  
It caught me--by surprise  
Mutts of the planet  
And shook me down for alibis  
I'm waiting  
For the keeper to release me  
Debating this sentence  
Biding my time  
In memories  
Of old friends of mine  
  
In daydreams of Birdland  
I see my soul on fire  
Burning up the bandstand  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be happily attached  
To my cold hard cash!  
But now Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by  
  
There are things I wish I'd done  
Some friends I'm gonna miss  
Beautiful lovers  
I never got the chance to kiss  
  
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living  
Processions of missing  
Lovers and friends  
Fade in and they fade out again  
In these daydreams of rebirth  
I see myself in style  
Raking in what I'm worth  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be resurrected royal!  
I'll be rich as standard oil!  
But now, Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by

Joni Mitchell,A Strange Boy,/j/joni+mitchell/strange+boy_20075349.html,"A strange boy is weaving  
A course of grace and havoc  
On a yellow skateboard  
Through midday sidewalk traffic  
Just when I think he's foolish and childish  
And I want him to be manly  
I catch my fool and my child  
Needing love and understanding  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
He still lives with his family  
Even the war and the navy  
Couldn't bring him to maturity  
  
He keeps referring back to school days  
And clinging to his child  
Fidgeting and bullied  
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild  
He asked me to be patient  
Well I failed  
""Grow up!"" I cried  
And as, the smoke was clearing he said  
""Give me one good reason why!""  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
He sees the cars as sets of waves  
Sequences of mass and space  
He sees the damage in my face  
  
We got high on travel  
And we got drunk on alcohol  
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all  
See how that feeling comes and goes  
Like the pull of moon on tides  
Now I am surf rising  
Now parched ribs of sand at his side  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
I gave him clothes and jewelry  
I gave him my warm body  
I gave him power over me  
  
A thousand glass eyes were staring  
In a cellar full of antique dolls  
I found an old piano  
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls  
While the boarders were snoring  
Under crisp white sheets of curfew  
We were newly lovers then  
We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules

I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive

To dance with me baby  
Do you want to take a chance  
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby

Looking for the key to set me free

It's the unraveling  
And it undoes all the joy that could be

I want to be the one that you want to see  
I want to knit you a sweater  
Want to write you a love letter

Joni Mitchell,Amelia,/j/joni+mitchell/amelia_20075416.html,"I was driving across the burning desert  
When I spotted six jet planes  
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain  
It was the hexagram of the heavens  
it was the strings of my guitar  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
The drone of flying engines  
Is a song so wild and blue  
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you  
Then your life becomes a travelogue  
Of picture-post-card-charms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
People will tell you where they've gone  
They'll tell you where to go  
But till you get there yourself you never really know  
Where some have found their paradise  
Others just come to harm  
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
I wish that he was here tonight  
It's so hard to obey  
His sad request of me to kindly stay away  
So this is how I hide the hurt  
As the road leads cursed and charmed  
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
A ghost of aviation  
She was swallowed by the sky  
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly  
Like Icarus ascending  
On beautiful foolish arms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
Maybe I've never really loved  
I guess that is the truth  
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude  
And looking down on everything  
I crashed into his arms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel  
To shower off the dust  
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust  
I dreamed of 747's  
Over geometric farms  
Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms

The night I looked at you

A dream that I could call my own

A red hawk rides the sky  
I guess I should be happy  
Just to be alive...  
But we have poisoned everything  
And oblivious to it all  
The cell phone zombies babble  
Through the shopping malls  
While condors fall from Indian skies  
Whales beach and die in sand...  
Bad dreams are good  
In the great plan.  
  
You cannot be trusted  
Do you even know you're lying  
It's dangerous to kid yourself  
You go deaf and dumb and blind.  
You take with such entitlement.  
You give bad attitude.  
You have no grace  
No empathy  
No gratitude  
  
You have no sense of consequence  
Oh my head is in my hands...  
Bad dreams are good  
In the great plan.  
  
Before that altering apple  
We were one with everything  
No sense of self and other  
No self-consciousness.  
But now we have to grapple  
With our man-made world backfiring  
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.  
  
And everyone's a victim!  
Nobody's hands are clean.  
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth  
So near the jaws of our machines.  
We live in these electric scabs.  
These lesions once were lakes.  
No one knows how to shoulder the blame  
Or learn from past mistakes...  
So who will come to save the day?  
Mighty Mouse?  
Superman?  
Bad dreams are good in the great plan.

Joni Mitchell,Banquet,/j/joni+mitchell/banquet_20075329.html,"Come to the dinner gong  
The table is laden high  
Fat bellies and hungry little ones  
Tuck your napkins in  
And take your share  
Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing  
Though there's plenty to spare  
  
I took my share down by the sea  
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide  
Seagulls come down  
And they squawk at me  
Down where the water-skiers glide  
  
Some turn to Jesus  
And some turn to heroin  
Some turn to rambling round  
Looking for a clean sky  
And a drinking stream  
Some watch the paint peel off  
Some watch their kids grow up  
Some watch their stocks and bonds  
Waiting for that big deal  
American Dream  
  
I took my dream down by the sea  
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine  
And logs and sails  
And Shell Oil pails  
Dogs and tugs and summertime  
Back in the banquet line  
Angry young people crying  
  
Who let the greedy in  
And who left the needy out  
Who made this salty soup  
Tell him we're very hungry now  
For a sweeter fare  
In the cookie I read  
""Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing

Black diamond earrings

And Singapore slings

Not one anxious voice  
None of the crazy you get  
From too much choice  
The thumb and the satchel  
Or the rented Rolls-Royce  
And you think she knows something  
By the second refill  
You think she's enlightened  
As she totals your bill  
You say ""Show me the way  
To Barangrill""  
  
Well some say it's in service  
They say ""Humble Makes Pure""  
You're hoping it's near Folly  
'Cause you're headed that way for sure  
And you just have to laugh  
'Cause it's all so crazy  
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend  
And eggs over easy  
It's just a trick on you  
Her mirrors and your will  
So you ask the truck driver  
On the way to the till  
But he's just a slave  
To Barangrill  
  
The guy at the gas pumps  
He's got a lot of soul  
He sings Merry Christmas for you  
Just like Nat King Cole  
And he makes up his own tune  
Right on the spot  
About whitewalls and windshields  
And this job he's got  
And you want to get moving  
And you want to stay still  
But lost in the moment  
Some longing gets filled  
And you even forget to ask  
""Hey, Where's Barangrill?""

Good or bad, we think we know  
As if thinking makes things so!  
All convictions grow along a borderline  
  
Smug in your jaded expertise  
You scathe the wonder world  
And you praise barbarity  
In this illusionary place--  
This scared hard-edged rat race  
All liberty is laced with  
Borderlines  
  
Every income, every age  
Every fashion-plated rage  
Every measure, every gauge  
Creates a borderline  
Every stone thrown through glass  
Every mean-streets-kick ass  
Every swan caught on the grass  
Will draw a borderline  
  
You snipe so steady  
You snub so snide--  
So ripe and ready  
To diminish and deride!  
You're so quick to condescend  
My opinionated friend  
All you deface, all you defend  
Is just a borderline  
Just a borderline ...  
Another borderline ...  
Just a borderline

Joni Mitchell,Both Sides,/j/joni+mitchell/both+sides_20625957.html,"Rows and flows of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and they snow on everyone  
So so many things I would've done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and junes and ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way that you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know love  
Really don't know love at all  
  
But now it's just another show  
and you leave em laughing when you go  
and if you can don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
Angel dust gets in your eyes, your hair  
On acid stars you're getting there  
My body's assembled into  
A little itty-bitty gift to you  
When you die, I've looked at life that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave em laughing when you go  
So so don't let them inside, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself ohh away  
  
But now my friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads man, they say I've changed, well  
Well, something's lost, rearranged  
From living every, every, every, I've  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's just illusions I recall

I really don't know, I really don't know  
I really don't, I really don't clouds at all  
Why are we here.... Terrified, terrified, wow

Joni Mitchell,Cactus Tree,/j/joni+mitchell/cactus+tree_20075360.html,"There's a man who's been out sailing  
In a decade full of dreams  
And he takes her to a schooner  
And he treats her like a queen  
Bearing beads from California  
With their amber stones and green  
He has called her from the harbor  
He has kissed her with his freedom  
He has heard her off to starboard  
In the breaking and the breathing  
Of the water weeds  
While she was busy being free  
  
There's a man who's climbed a mountain  
And he's calling out her name  
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles  
He calls again  
He can think her there beside him  
He can miss her just the same  
He has missed her in the forest  
While he showed her all the flowers  
And the branches sang the chorus  
As he climbed the scaley towers  
Of a forest tree  
While she was somewhere being free  
  
There's a man who's sent a letter  
And he's waiting for reply  
He has asked her of her travels  
Since the day they said goodbye  
He writes ""Wish you were beside me  
We can make it if we try""  
He has seen her at the office  
With her name on all his papers  
Through the sharing of the profits  
He will find it hard to shake her  
From his memory  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a lady in the city  
And she thinks she loves them all  
There's the one who's thinking of her  
There's the one who sometimes calls  
There's the one who writes her letters  
With his facts and figures scrawl  
She has brought them to her senses  
They have laughed inside her laughter  
Now she rallies her defenses  
For she fears that one will ask her  
For eternity  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a man who sends her medals  
He is bleeding from the war  
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store  
There's a drummer and a dreamer  
And you know there may be more  
She will love them when she sees them  
They will lose her if they follow  
And she only means to please them  
And her heart is full and hollow  
Like a cactus tree  
While she's so busy being free

They won't give peace a chance  
That was just a dream some of us had  
Still a lot of land to see  
But I wouldn't stay here  
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here.  
  
Oh, but California  
California, I'm coming home  
I'm going to see the folks I dig  
I'll even kiss a sunset pig  
California, I'm coming home.  
  
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle  
Who did the goat dance very well  
He gave me back my smile  
But he kept my camera to sell  
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue  
He cooked good omelets and stews  
And I might have stayed on with him there  
  
But my heart cried out for you, California  
Oh California, I'm coming home  
Oh make me feel good rock'n roll band  
I'm your biggest fan  
California, I'm coming home  
  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When you're walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
Just gives you the blues  
Just gives you the blues  
  
So I bought me a ticket  
I got on a plane to Spain  
Went to a party down a red dirt road  
There were lots of pretty people there  
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue  
They said, ""How long can you hang around?""  
I said a week, maybe two  
Just until my skin turns brown  
  
Then I'm going home to California  
California, I'm coming home  
Oh will you take me as I am  
Strung out on another man  
California, I'm coming home  
  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When you're walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
More about the war  
And the bloody changes

He's not like me  
I watch for judgement anxiously  
Now where in the city can that boy be  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill  
  
He's a real good talker--I think he's friend  
Fast tires come screaming around the bend  
But there's still no buzzer  
They roll on  
And-I'm waiting for his car on the hill  
It always seems so righteous at the start  
When there's so much laughter  
When there's so much spark  
When there's so much sweetness in the dark  
Waiting for a car

Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
There's a sun show every second  
  
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today  
And the streets are paved with passersby  
And pigeons fly  
And papers lie  
Waiting to blow away  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew  
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too  
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses  
  
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away  
I will bring you incense owls by night  
By candlelight  
By jewel-light  
If only you will stay  
Pretty baby, won't you  
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

We've got cold cuts from the fridge

We used to climb up in the branches  
Just to sway there in some breeze  
Now the cops on the street  
They want Cherokee Louise  
  
People like to talk  
Tongues are waggin' over fences  
Waggin' over phones  
All their doors are locked

And press your hands like it was bubble bath  
In dust piled high as me

Walking to the door  
Going out you get the 3rd degree  
And comin' in you get the 3rd world war

We put our pennies on the rails  
And when the train went by  
We were jumpin' round like fools  
Goin' ""Look no heads or tails""  
Goin' ""Look my lucky prize""

And he yanks her to her knees

Joni Mitchell,Come In From The Cold,/j/joni+mitchell/come+in+from+the+cold_20075407.html,"Back in 1957  
We had to dance a foot apart  
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines  
Holding their rulers without a heart  
And so with just a touch of our fingers  
I could make our circuitry explode  
All we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so young)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
We really thought we had a purpose  
We were so anxious to achieve  
We had hope  
The world held promise  
For a slave to liberty  
Freely I slaved away for something better  
And I was bought and sold  
And all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so sure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I feel your leg under the table  
Leaning into mine  
I feel renewed  
I feel disabled  
By these bonfires in my spine  
I don't know who the arsonist was  
Which incendiary soul  
But all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so warm)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I am not some stone commission  
Like a statue in a park  
I am flesh and blood and vision  
I am howling in the dark  
Long blue shadows of the jackals  
Are falling on a pay phone by the road  
Oh all they ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(I was so low)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
Is this just vulgar electricity  
Is this the edifying fire  
(it was so pure)  
Does your smile's covert complicity  
Debase as it admires  
(just a flu with a temperature)  
Are you just checking out your mojo  
(oh oh)  
Or am I just fighting off growing old  
(just a high fever)  
All I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(it was so pure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I know we never will be perfect  
Never entirely clear  
(when the moon shines)  
We get hurt and we just panic  
And we strike out  
Out of fear  
(you were only being kind)  
I fear the sentence of this solitude  
200 years on hold  
(for my loving crime)  
Oh and all we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(when the moon shines)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
When I thought life had some purpose  
Then I thought I had some choice  
(I was running blind)  
And I made some value judgments  
In a self-important voice  
(I was outa line)  
But then absurdity came over me  
And I longed to lose control  
(into no mind)  
Oh all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so kind)  
Please come in  
(so kind)  
Come in from the cold  
Come in come in  
Come in from the cold, etc.

Dancing up a river in the dark  
Looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
He was playing on the sidewalk  
For passing change  
When something strange happened  
Glory train passed through him  
So he buried the coins he made  
In People's Park  
And went looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
It seemed like he read my mind  
He saw me mistrusting him  
And still acting kind  
He saw how I worried sometimes  
I worry sometimes

They've all seen the stain-  
On their daily bread  
On their christian names  
I cleared myself  
I sacrificed my blues  
And you could complete me  
I'd complete you

But when there's no place left to turn  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
You give the call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart, I know  
I've been around  
I'm an old hand  
I'll understand if you have to go  
  
So make your mark  
For your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me

Joni Mitchell,Don't Interrupt The Sorrow,/j/joni+mitchell/dont+interrupt+the+sorrow_20075350.html,"Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
In flames our prophet witches  
Be polite  
A room full of glasses  
He says ""Your notches liberation doll""  
And he chains me with that serpent  
To that Ethiopian wall  
  
Anima rising  
Queen of Queens  
Wash my guilt of Eden  
Wash and balance me  
Anima rising  
Uprising in me tonight  
She's a vengeful little goddess  
With an ancient crown to fight  
  
Truth goes up in vapors  
The steeples lean  
Winds of change patriarchs  
Snug in your bible belt dreams  
God goes up the chimney  
Like childhood Santa Claus  
The good slaves love the good book  
A rebel loves a cause  
  
I'm leaving on the 1:15  
You're darn right  
Since I was seventeen  
I've had no one over me  
He says ""Anima rising-  
So what-  
Petrified wood process  
Tall timber down to rock!""  
  
Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
He says ""We walked on the moon  
You be polite.""  
Don't let up the sorrow  
Death and birth and death and birth  
He says ""Bring that bottle kindly  
And I'll pad your purse-  
I've got a head full of quandary  
And a mighty, mighty, thirst.""  
  
Seventeen glasses  
Rhine wine  
Milk of the Madonna  
Clandestine  
He don't let up the sorrow  
He lies and he cheats  
It takes a heart like Mary's these days  
When your man gets weak

Just be happy my love

And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day the sensible way  
And still be friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
That should be the rule  
Give your heart and your love  
To whomever you love  
Darlin' don't be a fool  
  
Why do we cling to this old faded thing  
That used to be  
So if you can forget  
Then you don't worry 'bout me

Joni Mitchell,Down To You,/j/joni+mitchell/down+to+you_20075301.html,"Everything comes and goes  
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes  
Things that you held high  
And told yourself were true  
Lost or changing as the days come down to you  
Down to you  
Constant stranger  
You're a kind person  
You're a cold person too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you.  
You go down to the pick up station  
Craving warmth and beauty  
You settle for less than fascination  
A few drinks later you're not so choosy  
When the closing lights strip off the shadows  
On this strange new flesh you've found  
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf  
You hurry  
To the blackness  
And the blankets  
To lay down an impression  
And your loneliness  
  
In the morning there are lovers in the street  
They look so high  
You brush against a stranger  
And you both apologize  
Old friends seem indifferent  
You must have brought that on  
Old bonds have broken down  
Love is gone  
Ooh, love is gone  
Written on your spirit this sad song  
Love is gone  
  
Everything comes and goes  
Pleasure moves on too early  
And trouble leaves too slow  
Just when you're thinking  
You've finally got it made  
Bad news comes knocking  
At your garden gate  
Knocking for you  
Constant stranger  
You're a brute-you're an angel  
You can crawl-you can fly too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you

A long way from snow chains  
Donkey vendors slicing coconut  
No parkas to their name  
Black babies covered in baking flour  
The cook's got a carnival song  
We're going to lay down someplace shady  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus  
Come marching out of the waves  
And claim the beach and all concessions  
In the name of the suntan slave  
I wrapped that flag around me  
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong  
And I lay down thinking national  
With dreamland coming on

Good time Mary and a fortune hunter  
All dressed up to follow the drums  
Mary in a feather hula-hoop  
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun  
All saints, all sinners shining  
Heed those trumpets all night long  
Propped up on a samba beat  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
Tar baby and the Great White Wonder  
Talking over a glass of rum  
Burning on the inside  
With the knowledge of things to come  
There's gambling out on the terrace  
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn  
As they lead toward temptation  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
In a plane flying back to winter  
In shoes full of tropic sand  
A lady in a foreign flag  
On the arm of her Marlboro Man  
The hawk howls in New York City  
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn  
As they push the recline buttons down  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
La, la  
African sand on the trade winds  
And the sun on the Amazon  
As they push the reline buttons down  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland

She don't understand  
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices  
She's not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
The masking tape tangles  
It's sticky and black  
And the copper  
Proud headed Queen Lizzie  
Conducts little charges  
That don't get charged back  
Well the technical manual's busy  
She's not going to fix it up too easy  
And she holds out her flashlight  
And she shines it on me  
She wants me to tell her  
What the trouble might be  
Well I'm learning  
It's peaceful  
With a good dog and some trees  
Out of touch with the breakdown  
Of this century  
They're not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
We once loved-together  
And we floodlit that time  
Input-output-electricity  
But the lines overloaded  
And the sparks started flying  
And the loose wires  
Were lashing out at me  
She's not going to fix that up  
Too easy  
But she holds out her candle  
And she shines it in  
And she begs him to show her  
How to fix it again  
While the song that he sang her  
To soothe her to sleep  
Runs all through her circuits  
Like a heartbeat  
She's not going to fix it up  
Too easy

Flies in your babies' eyes--Ethiopia  
Walking sticks on burning plains  
Betrayed by politics  
Abandoned by the rains  
On and on, the human need  
On and on, the human greed profanes

Your top soil flies away--Ethiopia  
We pump ours full of poison spray--Ethiopia  
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns  
I hear the whine of chain saws  
Hacking rain forests down  
On and on, insanities  
On and on, short sighted greed abounds

Little garden planet-oasis in space  
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand it  
Famine phantoms at the garden gates  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Every Sunday on T.V. Ethiopia  
You suffer with such dignity Ethiopia  
A T.V. star with a P.R. smile  
Calls your baby ""it"" while strolling  
Through your tragic trials  
On and on, stupidity  
On and on, the basic needs are defiled  
Good air, good water, good earth

I went shopping today for jewels  
The wind rushed around in the dirty town  
And the children let out from the schools  
I was standing on a noisy corner  
Waiting for the walking green  
Across the street he stood  
And he played real good  
On his clarinet, for free  
  
Now me I play for fortunes  
And those velvet curtain calls  
I've got a black limousine  
And two gentlemen  
Escorting me to the halls  
And I play if you have the money  
Or if you're a friend to me  
But the one man band  
By the quick lunch stand  
He was playing real good, for free  
  
Nobody stopped to hear him  
Though he played so sweet and high  
They knew he had never  
Been on their T.V.  
So they passed his music by  
I meant to go over and ask for a song  
Maybe put on a harmony...  
I heard his refrain  
As the signal changed  
He was playing real good, for free

Joni Mitchell,For The Roses,/j/joni+mitchell/for+the+roses_20075334.html,"I heard it in the wind last night  
It sounded like applause  
Did you get a round resounding for you  
Way up here  
It seems like many dim years ago  
Since I heard that face to face  
Or seen you face to face  
Though tonight I can feel you here  
I get these notes  
On butterflies and lilac sprays  
From girls who just have to tell me  
They saw you somewhere  
  
In some office sits a poet  
And he trembles as he sings  
And he asks some guy  
To circulate his soul around  
On your mark red ribbon runner  
The caressing rev of motors  
Finely tuned like fancy women  
In thirties evening gowns  
Up the charts  
Off to the airport-  
Your name's in the news  
Everything's first class-  
The lights go down-  
And it's just you up there  
Getting them to feel like that  
  
Remember the days when you used to sit  
And make up your tunes for love  
And pour your simple sorrow  
To the sound hole and your knee  
And now you're seen  
On giant screens  
And at parties for the press  
And for people who have slices of you  
From the company  
They toss around your latest golden egg  
Speculation-well, who's to know  
If the next one in the nest  
Will glitter for them so  
  
I guess I seem ungrateful  
With my teeth sunk in the hand  
That brings me things  
I really can't give up just yet  
Now I sit up here  
The critic!  
And they introduce some band  
But they seem so much confetti  
Looking at them on my TV set  
Oh the power and the glory  
Just when you're getting a taste for worship  
They start bringing out the hammers  
And the boards  
And the nails  
  
I heard it in the wind last night  
It sounded like applause  
Chilly now  
End of summer  
No more shiny hot nights  
It was just the arbutus rustling  
And the bumping of the logs  
And the moon swept down black water  
Like an empty spotlight

And I do good business  
There's a lot of people asking for my time  
They're trying to get ahead  
They're trying to be a good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
There was nobody calling me up for favors  
  
And no one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song  
I deal in dreamers  
And telephone screamers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If l had my way  
I'd just walk out those doors  
  
And wander  
Down the Champs Elysees  
Going cafe to cabaret  
Thinking how I'll feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
Nobody was calling me up for favors  
No one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow

Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now  
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone  
Faded out with ragtime blues  
Handy's cast in bronze  
And he's standing in a little park  
With a trumpet in his hand  
Like he's listening back to the good old bands  
And the click of high heeled shoes  
Old Furry sings the blues  
Propped up in his bed  
With his dentures and his leg removed  
And Ginny's there  
For her kindness and Furry's beer  
She's the old man's angel overseer  
  
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps  
In the gray decay  
They chew the last few dollars off  
Old Beale Street's carcass  
Carrion and mercy  
Blue and silver sparkling drums  
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns  
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one  
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee  
Old Furry sings the blues  
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you  
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel  
But there was one song he played  
I could really feel  
  
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy  
The old girl's silent across the street  
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat  
Silent, staring are her stolen name  
Diamond boys and satin dolls  
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls  
To parking lots and shopping malls  
As they tear down old Beale Street  
Old Furry sings the blues  
He points a bony finger at you and  
""I don't like you""  
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke  
But it's true  
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke  
  
W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay  
And I'm not familiar with what you played  
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day  
Looking up and down old Beale Street  
Ghosts of the darktown society  
Come right out of the bricks at me  
Like it's a Saturday night  
They're in their finery  
Dancing it up and making deals  
Furry sings the blues  
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true  
Fallen to hard luck  
And time and other thieves  
While our limo is shining on his shanty street  
Old Furry sings the blues

And color them silver and saffron and blue  
  
Build me a window to watch everything  
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by  
No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing  
No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky

And live deep inside you  
Wherever you are

I will find harmonies waiting unsung  
With two souls to sing them  
Where once there was one

Blind rage to kill

Skinny black models with Raven curls

Joni Mitchell,If I Had A Heart,/j/joni+mitchell/if+i+had+a+heart_20727770.html,"Holy war  
Genocide  
Suicide  
Hate and cruelty...  
How can this be holy?  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
These ancient tales...  
The good go to heaven  
And the wicked ones burn in hell...  
Ring the funeral bells!  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
There's just too many people now  
Too little land  
Much too much desire  
You feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand  
Big bombs and barbed wire  
We've set our lovely sky  
Our lovely sky  
On fire!  
  
There's just too many people now  
And too little land  
Too much rage and desire  
It makes you feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand-  
Big bombs and barbed wire...  
Can't you see  
Our destiny?  
We are making this Earth  
Our funeral pyre!  
  
Holy Earth  
How can we heal you?  
We cover you like a blight...  
Strange birds of appetite...  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.

Joni Mitchell,In France They Kiss On Main Street,/j/joni+mitchell/in+france+they+kiss+on+main+street_20075353.html,"Downtown  
My darling dime store thief  
In the War of Independence  
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory  
Under neon signs  
A girl was in bloom  
And a woman was fading  
In a suburban room  
I said, ""Take me to the dance""  
""Do you want to dance?""  
""I love to dance""  
And I told him, ""They don't take chances  
They seem so removed from romance""  
""They've been broken in churches and schools  
And molded to middle class circumstance""  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
The dance halls and cafes  
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart  
Just doing the latest dance craze  
Gail and Louise  
In those push-up brassieres  
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings  
Drinking up the band's beers  
Young love was kissing under bridges  
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes  
And we were walking down Main Street  
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays  
""In France they kiss on Main Street""  
""Amour, mama, not cheap display""  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
In the pinball arcade  
With his head full of pool hall pitches  
And songs from the hit parade  
He'd be singing ""Bye, Bye, Love""  
While he's racking up his free play  
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys  
Come and carry us away  
Sometimes Chickie had the car  
Or Ron had a car  
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head  
We'd all go looking for a party  
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead  
And I'd be kissing in the back seat  
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said  
And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling

Joni Mitchell,Love,/j/joni+mitchell/love_10153826.html,"Although I speak in tongues  
Of men and angels  
I'm just sounding brass  
And tinkling cymbals without love-  
  
Love suffers long-  
Love is kind!-  
Enduring all things-  
Love has no evil in mind  
  
If I had the gift of prophecy-  
And all the knowledge-  
And the faith to move the mountains  
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-  
If I didn't have love  
I'd be nothing  
  
Love-never looks for love-  
Love's not puffed up-  
Or envious-  
Or touchy-  
Because it rejoices in the truth  
Not in iniquity  
Love sees like a child sees  
  
As a child I spoke as a child-  
I thought and I understood as a child-  
But when I became a woman-  
I put away childish things  
And began to see through a glass darkly  
  
Where, as a child, I saw it face to face  
Now, I only know it in part  
Fractions in me  
Of faith and hope and love  
And of these great three  
Love's the greatest beauty  
Love  
Love

Is strung with tungsten stars  
Lot's of forty watt successes  
He says, ""Where's my own shining hour?""  
He's the well kept secret of the underground  
He's in debt to the company store  
Because his only channeled aspiration  
Was getting back that girl he had before  
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme  
Describing what it is to lose  
He's got some just for laughs, he's got some for love  
That mainline to his blues  
Some to shed a little light  
On you and on me  
Some to shed a little light  
On a human story  
The wars of pride and property  
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew  
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas  
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view  
Brave reporters bring the battles home  
But tonight inside that box  
Just more bang-bang ketchup color to him  
Just more Twentieth Century Fox  
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting  
Just out of reach outside his bed  
She kicks the covers off of his sleep  
For the clumsy things he said  
She commands his head  
She tries his sanity  
She demands his head  
Tonight unknowingly  
Vaguely she floats and lacelike  
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind  
She's nebulous and naked  
He wonders where she's been  
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there  
Her evasiveness stings him now  
With long legs, long lonely legs  
Bruised from banging into things  
One day he was standing just outside her door  
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons  
She just laughed  
She said she heard him knocking  
And she teased him for the moon  
""Is one the moon, dear clown  
Tied to a string for me?""  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For truth or mystery  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For love or money

Steps inside a candy store  
Reds are sweet and greens are sour  
Still no letter at her door  
So she'll wash her flower curtains  
Hang them in the wind to dry  
Dust her tables with his shirt and  
Wave another day goodbye  
  
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber  
Marcie's sorrow needs a man  
Red is autumn green is summer  
Greens are turning and the sand  
All along the ocean beaches  
Stares up empty at the sky  
Marcie buys a bag of peaches  
Stops a postman passing by  
And summer goes  
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper  
Winter blows  
Up from the river there's no one to take her  
To the sea  
  
Marcie dresses warm its snowing  
Takes a yellow cab uptown  
Red is stop and green's for going  
Sees a show and rides back down  
Down along the Hudson River  
Past the shipyards in the cold  
Still no letter's been delivered  
Still the winter days unfold  
Like magazines  
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars  
Make a dream  
Dream back to summer and hear how  
He tells her  
Wait for me  
  
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us  
Where or why she moved away  
Red is angry green is jealous  
That was all she had to say  
Someone thought they saw her Sunday  
Window shopping in the rain  
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket  
And went west again

I stepped outside of my little house and stood barefoot on a rock. The pacific
ocean rolled towards me. Across the bay, a family of seals sprawled on the
kelp uncovered by the low tide. A blue heron honked overhead. All around the
house the wild roses were blooming. The air smelled sweet and salty and loud
with crows and bees. My house was clean. I had food in the fridge for a week.
I sat outside 'til the sun went down.  
  
That night the piano beckoned for the first time in ten years. My fingers
found these patterns which express what words could not. This song poured out
while a brown bear rummaged through my garbage cans.  
  
The song has seven verses constructed for the days of that happy week. On
Thursday the bear arrives.

And a Iampshade crown  
One minute she's so happy  
Then she's crying on someone's knee  
Saying laughing and crying  
You know it's the same release  
  
I told you when I met you  
I was crazy  
Cry for us all Beauty  
Cry for Eddie in the corner  
Thinking he's nobody  
And Jack behind his joker  
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan  
And me in my frightened silence  
Thinking I don't understand  
  
I feel like I'm sleeping  
Can you wake me  
You seem to have a broader sensibility  
I'm just living on nerves and feelings  
With a weak and a lazy mind  
And coming to peoples parties  
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind  
  
I wish I had more sense ot humor  
Keeping the sadness at bay  
Throwing the lightness on these things  
Laughing it all away  
Laughing it alI away  
Laughing it all away

Joni Mitchell,Rainy Night House,/j/joni+mitchell/rainy+night+house_20075394.html,"It was a rainy night  
We took a taxi to your mother's home  
She went to Florida and left you  
With your father's gun, alone  
Upon her small white bed  
I fell into a dream  
You sat up all the night and watched me  
To see, who in the world I might be  
  
I am from the Sunday school  
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir  
You are a holy man  
On the F.M. radio  
I sat up all the night and watched thee  
To see, who in the world you might be.  
  
You called me beautiful  
You called your mother-she was very tanned  
So you packed your tent and you went  
To live out in the Arizona sand  
You are a refugee  
From a wealthy family  
You gave up all the golden factories  
To see, who in the world you might be

He was thinking for himself  
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs  
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves  
She says let me sit down  
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame  
It's a shame it's a crying shame  
Look at those jokers  
Glued to that damn hockey game  
Hey honey-you've got lots of cash  
Bring us round a bottle  
And we'll have some laughs  
Gin's what I'm drinking

I'm a pretty good cook  
I'm sitting on my groceries  
Come up to my kitchen  
I'll show you my best recipe  
I try and I try but I can't save a cent  
I'm up after midnight cooking  
Trying to make my rent  
I'm rough but I'm pleasin'  
I was raised on robbery  
  
We had a little money once  
They were pushing through a four lane highway  
Government gave us three thousand dollars  
You should have seen it fly away  
First he bought a '57 Biscayne  
He put it in the ditch  
He drunk up all the rest  
That son of a bitch  
His blood's bad whiskey  
I was raised on robbery  
  
You know you ain't bad looking  
I like the way you hold your drinks  
Come home with me honey  
I ain't asking for no full length mink  
Hey, where you going  
Don't go yet  
Your glass ain't empty and we just met  
You're mean when your loaded  
I was raised on robbery

I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

He tried hard to help me  
You know, he put me at ease  
And he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
Now I've gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had

Joni Mitchell,Roses Blue,/j/joni+mitchell/roses+blue_20075293.html,"I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain, I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place she's lately gotten to  
Gotten to, gotten to  
  
She's gotten to mysterious devotions  
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen  
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions  
She's laying her religion on her friends  
On her friends, on her friends  
  
Friends who come to ask her for their future  
Friends who come to find they can't be friends  
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her  
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when  
Won't say when, won't say when  
  
When all the black cards come you cannot barter  
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win  
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr  
It is her blackest spell she puts you in  
Puts you in, puts you in  
  
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you  
Inside your own self-pity there you swim  
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you  
And only with your laughter can you win  
Can you win, can you win  
  
You win the lasting laurels with your laughter  
It reaches like an arm before you sink  
To win the solitary truth you're after  
You dare not ask the priestess how to think  
How to think, how to think  
  
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain, I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place she's lately gotten to  
Gotten to, gotten to

Are you in some hotel room  
Does it have a view?  
Are you caught in a crowd  
Or holding some honey  
Who came on to you?  
Why do you have to be so jive  
O.K. hang up the phone  
It hurts  
But something survives  
Though it's undermined  
I'd still like to see you sometime  
  
I'm feeling so good  
And my friends all tell me  
That I'm looking fine  
I run in the woods  
I spring from the boulders  
Like a mama lion  
I'm not ready to  
Change my name again  
But you know I'm not after  
A piece of your fortune  
And your fame  
'Cause I tasted mine  
I'd just like to see you sometime  
  
Pack your suspenders  
I'll come meet your plane  
No need to surrender  
I just want to see you again  
  
We're in for more rain  
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees  
It seems such a shame  
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly  
I couldn't take them all on then  
With a heedful of questions and hypes  
So when the hopes got so slim  
I just resigned  
But I'd still like to see you sometime  
I'd sure like to see you

The blessings of parasites

Threatened by all things  
Devil of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
Devil of delight  
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws  
Governing blindness, blindness and sight  
  
Suntans in reservation dining rooms  
Pale miners in their lantern rays  
Night, night and day  
Hostage smile on presidents  
Freedom scribbled in the subway  
It's like night, night and day  
Threatened by all things  
God of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
God of delight  
Mythical god of the everlasting laws  
Governing day, day and night  
  
Critics of all expression  
Judges in black and white  
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right  
Compelled by prescribed standards  
Or some ideals we fight  
For wrong, wrong and right  
Threatened by all things  
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain  
Drawn to all things  
Man of delight-born again, born again  
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws  
Governing wrong, wrong and right  
Governing wrong, wrong and right

Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas  
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies  
Shine on science  
With its tunnel vision  
Shine on fertile farmland  
Buried under subdivisions

Shine on what we throw away  
And what we keep

Who threw away  
The vain old God  
kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven  
And fresh plowed sod  
Shine on good earth, good air, good water  
And a safe place  
For kids to play  
Shine on bombs exploding  
Half a mile away  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on world-wide traffic jams  
Honking day and night  
Shine on another asshole  
Passing on the right!  
Shine on the red light runners  
Busy talking on their cell phones  
Shine on the Catholic Church  
And the prisons that it owns  
Shine on all the Churches  
They all love less and less  
Shine on a hopeful girl  
In a dreamy dress  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on good humor  
Shine on good will  
Shine on lousy leadership  
Licensed to kill  
Shine on dying soldiers  
In patriotic pain  
Shine on mass destruction  
In some God's name!  
Shine on the pioneers  
Those seekers of mental health  
Craving simplicity  
They traveled inward  
Past themselves...  
May all their little lights shine

Up over the hill  
Jovial neighbors come down when they will  
With stories to tell  
Sometimes they do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Each of us rocks his share  
Eating muffin buns and berries  
By the steamy kitchen window  
Sometimes we do  
Our tongues turn blue  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Anywhere else now would seem very strange  
The seasons are changing  
Everyday in everyway  
Sometimes it is spring  
Sometimes it is not anything  
A poet can sing  
Sometimes we try  
Yes we always try  
We have a rocking chair  
Somedays we rock and stare  
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river  
Sometimes we do  
We like the view  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Go to the city you'll come back again  
To wade through the grain  
You always do  
Yes we always do  
Come back to the stars  
Sweet well water and pickling jars  
We'll lend you the car  
We always do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Someone is always there  
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window

We wait for you

Joni Mitchell,Slouching Towards Bethlehem,/j/joni+mitchell/slouching+towards+bethlehem_20231890.html,"Turning and turning  
Within the widening gyre  
The falcon cannot hear the falconer  
Things fall apart  
The center cannot hold  
And a blood dimmed tide  
Is loosed upon the world  
  
Nothing is sacred  
The ceremony sinks  
Innocence is drowned  
In anarchy  
The best lack conviction  
Given some time to think  
And the worst are full of passion  
Without mercy  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
  
Hoping and hoping  
As if by my weak faith  
The spirit of this world  
Would heal and rise  
Vast are the shadows  
That straddle and strafe  
And struggle in the darkness  
Troubling my eyes  
  
Shaped like a lion  
It has the head of a man  
With a gaze as blank  
And pitiless as the sun  
And it's moving its slow thighs  
Across the desert sands  
Through dark indignant  
Reeling falcons  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
  
Raging and raging  
It rises from the deep  
Opening its eyes  
After twenty centuries  
Vexed to a nightmare  
Out of a stony sleep  
By a rocking cradle  
By the Sea of Galilee  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

Joni Mitchell,Song For Sharon,/j/joni+mitchell/song+for+sharon_20075348.html,"I went to Staten Island.  
To buy myself a mandolin  
And I saw the long white dress of love  
On a storefront mannequin  
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,  
All for something lacy  
Some girl's going to see that dress  
And crave that day like crazy  
  
Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada  
They can balance and they can climb  
Like their fathers before them  
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline  
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty  
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks  
I'm headed to the church  
To play Bingo  
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks  
  
I can keep my cool at poker  
But I'm a fool when love's at stake  
Because I can't conceal emotion  
What I'm feeling's always written on my face  
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street  
I went in to see her as a kind of joke  
And she lit a candle for my love luck  
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke  
  
Sharon, I left my man  
At a North Dakota junction  
And I came out to the ""Big Apple"" here  
To face the dream's malfunction  
Love's a repetitious danger  
You'd think I'd be accustomed to  
Well, I do accept the changes  
At least better than I used to do  
  
A woman I knew just drowned herself  
The well was deep and muddy  
She was just shaking off futility  
Or punishing somebody  
My friends were calling up all day yesterday  
All emotions and abstractions  
It seems we all live so close to that line  
And so far from satisfaction  
  
Dora says, ""Have children!""  
Mama and Betsy say-""Find yourself a charity.""  
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.""  
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes  
And lovely landscapes to discover  
But all I really want right now  
Is, find another lover  
  
When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon  
I went to every wedding in that little town  
To see the tears and the kisses  
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown  
And walking home on the railroad tracks  
Or swinging on the playground swing  
Love stimulated my illusions  
More than anything  
  
And when I went skating after Golden Reggie  
You know it was white lace I was chasing  
Chasing dreams  
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans  
He showed me first you get the kisses  
And then you get the tears  
But the ceremony of the bells and lace  
Still veils this reckless fool here  
  
Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink  
Circling in singles and in pairs  
In this vigorous anonymity  
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares  
And the power of reason  
And the flowers of deep feeling  
Seem to serve me  
Only to deceive me  
  
Sharon you've got a husband  
And a family and a farm  
I've got the apple of temptation  
And a diamond snake around my arm  
But you still have your music  
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky  
You sing for your friends and your family  
I'll walk green pastures by and by

Crows and ravens whistling  
Lines of weeping, strings of crying  
So much said in listening

When it strums the galaxy  
Dying roses will they will their  
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

Living can be such a pleasure  
You make it easy to take it in measures  
Like it was only a dance!  
  
We're dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity  
It's my solo  
Blue way  
And shadows have the saddest things to say  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some can't surrender  
They're too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
It's only a dance!

Joni Mitchell,Talk To Me,/j/joni+mitchell/talk+to+me_20075326.html,"There was a moon and a street lamp  
I didn't know I drank such a lot  
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda  
The full length of the parking lot!  
Oh, I talk too loose  
Again I talk too open and free  
I pay a high price for my open talking  
Like you do for your silent mystery  
  
Come and talk to me  
Please talk to me  
Talk to me, talk to me  
Mr. Mystery  
  
We could talk about Martha  
We could talk about landscapes  
I'm not above gossip  
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!  
Or we could talk about power  
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes  
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies  
Or Bergman's nordic blues  
Please just talk to me  
Any old theme you choose  
Just come and talk to me  
Mr. Mystery, talk to me  
  
You could talk like a fool-I'd listen  
You could talk like a sage  
Anyway the best of my mind  
All goes down on the strings and the page  
That mind picks up all these pictures  
It still gets my feet up to dance  
Even though it's covered with keyloids  
From the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""  
I stole that from Willy the Shake!  
You know, ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be""  
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!  
  
Is your silence that golden?  
Are you comfortable in it?  
Is it the key to your freedom  
Or is it the bars on your prison?  
Are you gagged by your ribbons?  
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?  
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!  
Come and spend some on me,  
Shut me up and talk to me!  
I'm always talking!  
Chicken squawking!  
Please talk to me

Big dipper hanging there  
Over the rented car

I'm a runaway from the record biz  
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
  
Sophia says ""It's hard to catch  
And harder still to ride  
The time to watch the beast the best  
Is when it's purring at your side""  
Purring at your side  
Accolades and honors  
One false move and you're a goner  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
In the forest of the night  
  
The moon shed light  
On my hopeless plight  
As the radio blared so bland  
Every disc, a poker chip  
Every song just a one night stand  
Formula music, girly guile  
Genuine junk food for juveniles  
Up and down the dial  
Mercenary style  
  
I watched the stars chuck down their spears  
And a plane went blinking by  
And I thought of Anna  
Wild and dear  
Like fireworks in the sky  
Fireworks in the sky  
I'm so sick of this game  
It's hip, it's hot  
Life's too short, the whole thing's gotten  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger

He's the only joy around

Bunch of bodies brooding there  
Dead pan side-walk vendors  
Hustling vacant stares

She dances for the sailors  
In a smoky cabaret bar underground  
Down in a cellar in a harbor town  
I know he told her love was treasure  
And they would reap the fullest bounty  
He only comes to port for pleasure  
So when the winds of morning  
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone  
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn  
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss

Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest  
  
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam Of a broken promise in the bay

I was at sea then  
I didn't see them  
I don't believe what you are saying

Is this some game that you are playing  
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last  
The one who drew him here

There was a time when he would  
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace

And he would hold me close  
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace

Nowhere near the mentioned murder place

Thirty years is worth a hundred and two  
It's really what we can do in our lifetime  
All my love I would give for as long as I may live  
With a love, true love, to last a lifetime

In the cool breeze of December

My whole life with you

Afraid that I might say the wrong  
Words and displease you

How does one define a crush combined with longing  
Longing to posses you oh so dearly  
I'm obsessed by you completely

Calloused by doubts, joys and fears,

Josh Groban,America,/j/josh+groban/america_20261931.html,"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together  
I've got some real estate here in my bag  
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies  
And walked off to look for America  
  
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh  
Michigan seems like a dream to me now  
And it took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw  
I've gone to look for America  
  
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces  
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy  
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera  
  
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat  
We smoked the last one an hour ago  
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine  
And the moon rose over an open field  
  
Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping  
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why  
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike  
They've all gone to look for America  
All gone to look for America  
All gone to look for America

Josh Groban,Anthem,/j/josh+groban/anthem_21098326.html,"No man, no madness  
Though their sad power may prevail  
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart  
They rise to fail  
  
She is eternal  
Long before nations' lines were drawn  
When no flags flew, when no armies stood  
My land was born  
  
And you ask me why I love her  
Through wars, death and despair  
She is the constant, we who don't care  
And you wonder will I leave her - but how?  
I cross over borders but I'm still there now  
  
How can I leave her?  
Where would I start?  
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart  
My land's only borders lie around my heart

The world outside begins to breathe  
See clouds arriving without warning  
I need you here to shelter me  
  
And I know that only time will tell us how  
To carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake to memorize you  
Give me more time to feel this way  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
If I could make these moments endless  
If I could stop the winds of change  
If we just keep our eyes wide open  
Then everything would stay the same  
  
And I know that only time will tell me how  
We'll carry on without each other

Give us more time to be this way  
We can't stay like this forever

Oh I will remember  
Remember all the love we shared today

Josh Groban,Bells of New York City,/j/josh+groban/bells+of+new+york+city_20894529.html,"There's a pale winter moon in the sky coming through my window  
And the park is laid out like a bed below  
It's a cold, dark night and my heart melts like the snow  
And the bells of New York City tell me not to go  
  
It's always this time of year that my thoughts undo me  
With the ghosts of many lifetimes all abound  
But from these mad heights I can always hear the sound  
Of the bells of New York City singing all around  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
Refuge from these broken dreams  
Wait right here oh wait with me  
On silent snow filled streets  
  
Sing to me one song for joy and one for redemption  
And whatever is in between that I call mine  
With the street lamp light to illuminate the gray  
And the bells of New York City calling me to stay  
The bells of New York City calling me to stay

Who broke my faith in all these years  
Who lays with you at night  
When I'm here all alone  
Remembering when I was your own

I'll let you go  
I'll let you fly  
Why do I keep on asking why  
I'll let you go  
Now that I found  
A way to keep somehow  
More than a broken vow  
  
Tell me the words I never said  
Show me the tears you never shed  
Give me the touch  
That one you promised to be mine  
Or has it vanished for all time

I close my eyes  
And dream of you and I  
And then I realize  
There's more to life than only bitterness and lies  
I close my eyes  
  
I'd give away my soul  
To hold you once again  
And never let this promise end

Josh Groban,So She Dances,/j/josh+groban/so+she+dances_20356883.html,"A waltz when she walks in the room  
She pulls back the hair from her face  
She turns to the window  
To sway in the moonlight  
Even her shadow has grace  
  
A waltz for the girl out of reach  
She lifts her hands up to the sky  
She moves with the music  
The song is her lover  
The melody's making her cry  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from a-far  
Calling me silently  
  
A waltz for the chance I should take  
But how will I know where to start?  
She's spinning between  
Constellations and dreams  
Her rhythm is my beating heart  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from a-far  
Calling me silently

I give up this view just to tell her  
  
When I close my eyes, I can see  
The spotlights are bright on you and me  
We've got the floor  
And you're in my arms  
How could I ask for more?

And goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

I knew a man who lived in fear  
It was huge, it was angry,  
It was drawing near.  
Behind his house a secret place  
Was the shadow of the demon  
He could never face.  
  
He built a wall of steel and flame  
And men with guns to keep it tame  
Then standing back he made it plain  
That the nightmare would never ever rise again  
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain.  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
And then one day the neighbors came  
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame  
They stood around outside the wall  
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all  
""My friends,"" he said, ""We've reached our goal  
The threat is under firm control  
As long as peace and order reign  
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain  
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain. ""

All your tenderness and your sweet caress

I said love is gone  
I can't go on  
Now love is gone  
I want to say but it's just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start, yeah  
But the words didn't come out right  
So I'll tell you straight from my heart

There'll be demons waitin' in the shadows of a concrete world

And still you run  
You only believe in God when you come undone  
  
So here you are  
You brought everything on yourself  
So easy to fall, (easy to fall)  
When you're all alone by yourself  
  
Words unspoken  
The words unspoken  
The words unspoken

Turning on me  
After all we've been through  
You want trouble then that's just  
The way it will be

A blue magical maze  
Now the circle is broken  
In a spellbinding rage  
Better see if you're holdin'  
The wrong edge of the blade  
  
If it's sharp, if it cuts

Melt away with me there's nothing else

Blasting rock and hip hop, they know  
All dressed down with no place to go  
A difficult age just takin' it slow  
Wait for better days  
  
Can't stop the wild and restless

Following the footsteps  
Where their fathers used to run

And vinyl LPs still got a cool sound  
Flash back to retro (retro)

Fighting wars under different names  
Losing daughters and sons, we all feel the pain  
Through the tears, why don't things ever change  
Between now and then  
  
While the radio's still playin'  
That familiar sweet love song  
We still share the same desire

To hold you close

One child's angry desire, one more  
One more, one

Magic leaves you without any clues

They wonder why  
  
Shadows of a golden age  
A generation waits for dawn

They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire

And all the lies they dare to tell  
Is it heaven or hell?  
They know very well

We drifted apart  
And here you are, by my side

So now I come to you with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am, with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me

Living without you, living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you  
Wanting you near

Turned night into day  
I need you to stay

Journey,Out Of Harms Way,/j/journey/out+of+harms+way_20700273.html,"He grew up in some forgotten midwest town  
His mama raised him well  
Barely getting by, but he'd be okay  
As far as he could tell  
Oh, the plant in town closed ten years ago  
Now an empty ghost ship stands  
For the last nine months he's tried to find a job  
But there's nothing to be had  
  
So he signs up to fight for Uncle Sam  
It's the only choice he's got  
To fight a desert war with another land  
Only to find peace or not  
He's a moving target in a desperate place  
Every day is a twist of fate  
Oh, his family wonders if he'll make it home  
Knowing his faith's his saving grace  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Harms way  
  
Oh, they sent him home to his family  
Nursing wounds that no one sees  
Certain scents and smells trigger flashback spells  
That rewind the tragedy  
All these memories hold him prisoner  
Cause of the violence he regrets  
What was his ticket out is his nightmare now  
In a war he can't forget  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way

They want you gone, they want the prize  
When day is done, risk it all  
One will stand, and one will fall  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win

With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been

You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes

Seal the deal  
Get it done  
Earn the right to say you've won  
Work it out  
Sacrifice  
Someone's gonna have to pay the price  
Face to face  
Stand your ground  
Stay in the zone, now don't back down  
More than pride  
You depend  
Fighting hard 'til the very end

Let the spirit take you higher  
It's a state of mind  
No one can define  
There's no limit to desire

I traveled far and wide through many different times.  
  
I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the one sided trials,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the tears as they cried,  
They had tears in their eyes,  
  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes.

Fueled the fury solid to the bone

Done a deal with the devil  
From a heart made of steel

Banging heads there 'til we all went broke  
When we don the leather  
And the whips and chains  
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed  
Fighting through the din and accolades  
Turn the phase around with razor blades  
Watched the movement grow into one voice  
Took on the whole world it had no choice

Where we can feel what we've been waiting for

On this stage, let it rage  
For a time we leave the world behind  
To be with our own kind

Darkness filled my soul  
Losing all control  
  
Down on the streets below  
Bright city lights would glow  
The energy would rise  
And through the heat I'd gaze  
Still counting empty days  
With fire in my eyes  
Living through this hell  
Can I break this spell

Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night

I heard your body talk  
I saw a shooting star  
In some magnetic trance  
Our beating hearts would dance  
And crash down from afar  
Oh how strange fate is  
Never dreamed of this

Judas Priest,Let Us Prey,/j/judas+priest/let+us+prey_20492090.html,"Call for the priest, I'm dying...  
  
Well, the pressure's too much, you know I peaked last night  
I gotta get some a quick release  
City is standing on my shoulders  
My body's going piece by piece  
Ooh..!  
  
Yes I know what I want and I know where to get it  
And I'm going there right away  
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on  
Down to my knees and pray  
Ooh..!  
  
When your back's to the wall come along one and all  
We shall fight all the slander that's penned  
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose  
For our triumph's the means to their end  
  
With you by my side I shall ride every storm  
  
Let the cynics drop dead in their critical head  
They're wrist merchants as we all can see  
Bunch of deaf ears with their columnized fears  
What a shame, what a shame, oh dear me!  
Ooh..!

Judas Priest,Living After Midnight,/j/judas+priest/living+after+midnight_20076163.html,"Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded  
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded  
I come alive in the neon light  
That's when I make my moves right  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded  
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded  
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take  
This motor's revved up, fit to break  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I'm aiming for ya I'm gonna floor ya  
My body's coming  
All night long  
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded  
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded  
I set my sights and then home in  
The joint starts flying when I begin  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

And helpless  
Beneath the pale  
Full moon  
My body is your sacrifice  
You spirit's coming soon  
  
I stare up at a  
Squalid night  
  
It's been so cold  
And smooth  
Turns tender kisses  
Into bites  
As you begin to move  
  
You look so weak  
And fragile  
You seem to drip  
And sway  
But you swept me up into  
Your arms  
And carried me away  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
You led me to temptation  
Delivered me to pain  
I walked upon you  
Hallowed ground  
My soul is yours to gain  
  
Your passion drains  
My energy  
Fear starts running deep  
I'm falling in  
Slow motion  
Into eternal sleep  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true

I can do

Judas Priest,Lochness,/j/judas+priest/lochness_20231869.html,"Grey mist drifts upon the water  
The mirrored surface moves  
Awakened of this presence  
Dispelling legends proof  
  
A beastly head of onyx  
With eyes set coals of fire  
It's leathered hide glides glistening  
Ascends the heathered briar  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternities  
On and on and on

Your terror of the deep  
Loch Ness distress  
Malingers what you keep  
Loch Ness protects monstrosity  
Loch Ness confess to me  
  
Somehow it heeds the piper  
From battlements that call  
From side to side it ponders  
In passion in the skirl  
  
This highland lair of mystery  
Retains a lost world empathy  
Resilient to discovery  
On and on and on  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternity  
Your secret lies safe with me  
  
This creature's peril from decease  
Implores to mankind for release  
A legacy to rest in peace  
On and on and on

You brought me serenity, a reason to live  
Our life is a journey  
That we took from the start  
We made all these memories together  
  
I can remember  
The first time that we met  
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget  
I knew from that moment  
When our love first began  
We'd last till the end of time forever  
  
And though there were bad times  
We stood by each other  
And did what we had to get through  
  
You live in my heart, when you're far away  
I see you in dreams where I hear you say  
I'm with you forever, in true love  
By light of the day and stars above

We held on each other  
To face what we had to get through

Look up to heaven, and I'll be there  
Still guiding my heart  
Still saying our prayer

When you feel warm  
That's when I rise  
That's when I crawl  
  
Gliding on mist  
Hardly a sound  
Bring the kiss  
Evils abound  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Into your room  
Where in deep sleep  
There you lie still  
To you I creep  
  
Then I descend  
Close to your lips  
Across you I bend  
You smile as I sip  
  
Now you are mine  
In my control  
One taste of your life  
And I own your soul  
  
Softly you stir  
Gently you moan  
Lust's in the air  
Wake as I groan  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Love bites you  
Invites you  
To feast in the night  
Excites you  
Delights you  
It drains you to white  
Love bites  
  
You knew at first sight  
You'd enjoy my attack  
That with my first bite  
There'd be no turning back  
  
So come in my arms  
I strike any hour  
I will return  
To trap and devour  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites

Drives us to the ultimate  
Cut loose extremes

Ignite the engines  
You can hear it scream  
You're gonna eat your words  
That challenged this machine  
  
The beast is revved up  
The flag is down  
The tires screech  
And lay a smoke screen all around  
  
Through the limits  
As they rocket past  
It's a blood bath  
There's no second place  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
  
Ice nerves of steel  
As I notch another kill  
You lose - I win  
I get to ride again  
  
Get it down  
Hit the ground  
Neon nights  
Speed of light  
  
Feel no mercy as I cross the line  
Watch the suckers self-destruct behind  
  
Machine Man's running  
You wanna try  
Machine Man's coming  
You're gonna die  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die

Louder than an atom bomb

Can you live without you  
Can you see into the future  
Will you ever set me free

A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, Fire Island  
  
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes  
  
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'  
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled ""Give me a bourbon""  
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting  
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action  
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact  
Then there he was, saw me and knew that  
  
I'd had too much, foolin' around  
Statues alive, seconds are hours  
  
Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters

You're in for a shock  
In London town streets  
When there's darkness and fog  
When you least expect me  
And you turn your back  
I'll attack  
  
I smile when I'm sneaking  
Through shadows by the wall  
I laugh when I'm creeping  
But you won't hear me at all  
  
All hear my warning  
Never turn your back  
On the ripper  
  
You'll soon shake with fear  
Never knowing if I'm near  
I'm sly and I'm shameless  
Nocturnal and nameless  
Except for ""The Ripper""  
Or if you like ""Jack The Knife""  
  
Any back alley street  
Is where we'll probably meet  
Underneath a gas lamp  
Where the air's cold and damp  
I'm a nasty surprise  
I'm a devil in disguise  
I'm a footstep at night  
I'm a scream of the fright  
  
All hear my warning  
Never turn your back  
On the ripper, the ripper, the ripper

Judas Priest,The Sentinel,/j/judas+priest/the+sentinel_20076022.html,"Along deserted avenues  
Steam begins to rise  
The figures primed and ready  
Prepared for quick surprise  
He's watchin' for a sign  
His life is on the line  
Dogs whine in the alleys  
Smoke is on the wind  
From deep inside its empty shell  
A cathedral bell begins to toll  
A storm begins to grow  
  
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars  
The challengers await  
And in their fists clutch iron bars  
With which to seal his fate  
Across his chest is scabbards rest  
The rows of throwing knives  
Whose razor points in challenged tests  
Have finished many lives  
  
Now facing one another  
The stand-off eats at time  
Then all at once a silence falls  
As the bell ceases its chime  
Upon this sign the challengers  
With shrieks and cries rush forth  
The knives fly out like bullets  
Upon their deadly course  
Screams of pain and agony  
Rent the silent air  
Amidst the dying bodies  
Blood runs everywhere  
The figure stands expressionless  
Impassive and alone  
Unmoved by this victory  
And the seeds of death he's sown  
  
Sworn to avenge  
Condemn to Hell  
Tempt not the blade  
All fear the Sentinel

The train's leavin' just after dark  
There's always room for a lovin' heart  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
I know my destination  
It's a' waitng for me  
I got no hesitation  
That's where I want to be  
And by the time that the sun comes up  
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
  
Just close your eyes and let it flow  
Lean your head back, let it go  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I got my reservations  
And I got you for you  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
Spirit move you, yeah  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?

Judds,I Saw The Light,/j/judds/i+saw+the+light_20076355.html,"I laid a red rose  
On your front porch  
Wrote ""I love you""  
On a note  
I rang the door bell  
And turned to go  
Baby, when the curtains moved  
I couldn't believe the view  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
I saw two shadows holding each other tight  
I know the truth when I look in your eyes  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
  
So take your cheatin' hands  
Off my red dress  
'Cause I ain't wearin'  
This thing for you  
I see you clearly now  
And your lies, too  
They say that love is blind  
Baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why, baby, why should I listen to you?  
I cried, baby, cried, now I'm walking out the door  
  
They say that love is blind, baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]

Judds,If I Were You,/j/judds/if+i+were+you_20076313.html,"If I were you  
I'd think it over  
Take your time  
Before you leave  
Everyone wants the perfect lover  
  
If I were you  
I'd fall in love with me  
If I were you  
I'd just remember  
Don't miss the forest for the trees  
  
The mighty flame  
Was once an ember  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me  
  
If I were you  
I'd whisper sweet I love you's everyday  
If I were you, I'd never ever let me get away  
  
If I were you  
I'd look me over  
There's much more than what you see  
I can prove You'll need no other  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me

Judds,I'm Falling In Love Tonight,/j/judds/im+falling+in+love+tonight_20076274.html,"Dance with me darlin' 'til dawn  
I want to sway in your arms  
'Til the stars fade away  
Fade away  
Moving together as one  
'Til the first gentle rays of the sun  
Light up the day  
Light the day  
  
[Chorus]  
And while the music still plays  
Please let me hear you keep saying  
Over and over I'm falling  
Falling in love with you  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Touch me and tell me it's true  
That I'm not asleep and that you  
Are not just a dream  
Just a dream  
  
Here with your heart pressed to mine  
We flow like the river that winds  
It's way to the sea  
To the sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight
