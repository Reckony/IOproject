Loretta Lynn,In The Sweet By And By,/l/loretta+lynn/in+the+sweet+by+and+by_20288338.html,"In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore  
There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart  
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there  
In the sweet by and by...  
  
To a wonderful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise  
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessings that hallow our days  
In the sweet by and by...

Loretta Lynn,It Won't Seem Like Christmas,/l/loretta+lynn/it+wont+seem+like+christmas_20330872.html,"Everybody's busy decorating Christmas trees  
And outside icicles hanging from the eaves  
And the snowlakes are flyin' just as far as I can see  
But it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas you'll be there and I'll be here  
So I'll decorate a heartache with my tears  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas what Christmas without you  
I'll be lonely but my darling I'll be true  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas to me

Loretta Lynn,It'll Feel Good When It Quits Hurtin',/l/loretta+lynn/itll+feel+good+when+it+quits+hurtin_20703111.html,"When you left me you thought I'll die sit at home alone and cry  
And it hurts me because that you were right  
I tell myself that I'll begin to try and forgive you but then  
I go and cry myself to sleep at night  
But somethin' that my mama said keeps goin' around inside my head  
And if I only knew that it was cool  
The time and tears will wash away this hurt I'm still in night and day  
And I know that I'll get over you  
Mama said one thing for certain it'll feel good when it quits hurtin'  
And you know that mamas always right  
And if this hurt will go away then I'll feel good again someday  
And I won't ever want you in my side  
And now you're spread all around just how you tore my playhouse down  
And that's because you broke my heart in two  
You think that love was fun and game and you don't even feel the shame  
But someday it may all come home to you  
And now you think you're flyin' high and you don't care how much I try  
What goes up will come back down someday  
And if my mama's words are true but then I won't be lovin' you  
And I'll be glad I heard my mama say  
Mama said one thing for certain...

Will need and want my love just like you do  
Now it's time to pay the fiddler but before we pay the fiddler  
Let's say to him please play one last final tune

Well it's time to pay the fiddler now there's naked sorrow drippin' from my

On'ry stranded and unshamed we've loved each other now we've got to leave it

So let's let the fiddler pull his magic bow across our heart strings just once

Loretta Lynn,Mornin' After Baby Let Me Down,/l/loretta+lynn/the+morning+after+baby+let+me+down_20263308.html,"The alarm clock woke my sleeping but I lay there for a minute  
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain  
I stopped that bell from ringin' in the times it takes a heartbeat  
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again  
I reached out for my baby for some early mornin' lovin'  
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head  
There was just an empty pillow and the mem'ry of his kisses  
Baby wasn't there beside me in the bed  
It's the morning after baby let me down  
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found  
Only silence to torment me no strong hands to touch me gently  
It's the mornin' after baby let me down  
  
There was nothing to hold on to but the sheets that fell around me  
And I started into trembling like a leaf  
How could he ever leave me he was more than just a lover  
And he knew all the ways to make me feel complete  
I can taste the salty teardrops God it's gettin' hard to swallow  
Hope a glass of wine will take his love away  
Got no appetite for eatin' just a sick and empty feeling  
What a good for nothing way to start the day  
It's the morning after baby...

Mother. That's the sweetest name of them all.  
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than anything else in the world.  
  
I love you more day by day - and I could never repay  
All the things that you've done for me.  
Your heart is filled with joyous times  
And your eyes - how they shine.

You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than mountains of silver and gold.

As in the city, I sit yearning  
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars  
Or driving fast in foreign cars  
To capture your remains  
You're an adventurer  
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head  
On the mountainside, they predict your death  
Oh, how you fooled them all  
But subjects are a poor excuse  
When what you really want's a muse  
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before  
Speeds of light  
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket  
Smoking wax - facts!  
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?  
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex  
To lose its grip?  
You're an adventurer  
You were out looking for meaning  
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit  
An adventurer  
You enter as I'm dreaming  
I wish I'd never wake up  
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love  
You're an adventurer  
You love the angles and the cherries  
The height and width of levies  
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race  
You're an adventurer  
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you  
You just will not think about it  
You dismiss it and defocus  
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!  
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking  
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone  
You're an adventurer  
And though I'll surely miss you  
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that  
But at this point I anticipate some grieving  
And although I know your leaving  
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do  
An adventurer  
Splitting up the atom  
Splitting up the once was  
Splitting up the essence  
Of our star-crossed fate  
None who meet you do forget you  
My adventurer, my adventurer  
My adventuress

Lou Reed,All Through The Night,/l/lou+reed/all+through+the+night_20085290.html,"You feel so lonely, when it's in the afternoon,  
And you gotta face it, all through the night.  
Don't it make you believe  
That something's gonna have to happen soon?  
Oh, baby, all through the night,  
All through the night.  
Oh, baby, all through the night,  
All through the night.  
All through the night.  
  
Have you ever played with an all-night band,  
And got through it, baby, all through the night,  
With a daytime of sin and a night time of hell?  
Everybody's gonna look for a bell to ring,  
All through the night.  
And they do it, all through the night, baby,  
All through the night.  
  
When the words pour down and the poetry comes,  
And the novel's written, and the book is done.  
You say: ""oh, Lord, lover, baby, give it to me,""  
All through the night.  
And she says it.  
  
Best friend Sally, she got sick,  
And I'm feeling mighty ill, myself.  
It happens all the time, and all through the night.  
I went to Saint Vincent's,  
And I'm watching the ceiling fall down on her body,  
As she's lying 'round on the ground.  
  
Said: ""oh, babe got to celebrate,"" all through the night.  
Made me feel so sad, I cried all through the night.  
I said: ""oh, Jesus,"" all through the night.  
If the sinner's in and the good man's gone,  
Then a woman can't come and help him home.  
  
Then what're gonna do about it,  
When they go on all through the night?  
All they sing: ""oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby,""  
All through the night.  
  
And he says: ""give it to me,"" all through the night.  
It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry  
To get a little loving, and some peace of mind.  
Said: ""hey, baby give it to me,"" all through the night.  
Some people wait for things that never come,  
And some people dream of things, they've never been done.  
They do it, oh, baby, all through the night.  
  
The city's funny and the country's wide,  
But I want to know why they don't have a right?  
Don't they do it, oh, baby, all through the night?  
Oh, mama, oh, mama, tell me 'bout it,  
All through the night.  
I want to have it all through the night.  
Christmas comes only once a year.  
  
Why can't anybody shed just one tear?  
For things that don't happen all through the night.  
Oh, mama, all through the night.  
Oh, baby, do it to me all through the night.  
Easy, easy, baby, why don't you give it to me?  
All through the night.

Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death

Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard  
going out, to the dirty boulevard  
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard  
going out  
  
Outside it's a bright night  
there's an opera at Lincoln Center  
movie stars arrive by limousine  
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan  
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets  
  
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel  
he's selling plastic roses for a buck  
The traffic's backed up to 39th street  
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck  
  
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming  
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can  
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling  
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""  
  
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard  
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard  
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard  
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly  
Fly, fly away  
I want to fly

Some U Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk  
Stir it up into a heady fro - tasted just like silk  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal St.  
And I think there's Ken's in Boston  
There must be something in L.A.

Was the Egg Cream of choice  
And if you don't believe me  
Go ask any of the boys  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
The only good thing I remember about P.S.92  
Was the Egg Cream served at Becky's  
It was a fearsome brew  
For fifty cents you got a shot - chocolate bubbles up your nose  
That made it easier to deal with knife flights  
and kids pissing in the street  
  
You scream, I steam, We all want Egg Cream  
  
So the next time you're in Brooklyn - Please say hello for me  
At Totonno's for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's  
But mostly you go to Becky's - sit in a booth and say hello  
And have two chocolate Egg Cream - one to stay and go

Growing up in public, growing up in public with your pants down  
  
Some people are into sadistic pleasures  
They whet their desires and drool in your ears  
They're quasi-effeminate characters in love with oral gratification  
They edify your integrities, so they can play on your fears

Some people think that the whole concept's a joke  
But some people think being a man is the whole point  
And then some people wish they'd never awoke  
  
Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions  
Down to a size neither regal nor calm  
A Prince Hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct  
Caught in the middle with your pants down again

There's five Cinderellas and some leather drags

and some crack team from Washington Heights  
The boys from Avenue B and the girls from Avenue D  
a Tinkerbell in tights

Especially when I see you're not around  
  
There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic  
in Latin, Greek or Spic  
There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander  
dishing all their tricks

Especially when I know you've gone away  
  
There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying ""I Blow""  
she's with the ""jive five 2 plus 3""  
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates  
or else doing it for free  
  
The past keeps knock, knock, knocking on my door  
And I don't want to hear it anymore  
  
No consolations please for feelin' funky  
I got to get my head above my knees  
But it makes me mad and mad makes me sad  
and then I start to freeze  
  
In the back of my mind I was afraid it might be true  
In the back of my mind I was afraid that they meant you

What books it has read - that make it that way  
And where it got the right - to speak to anyone that way

Lou Reed,Images,/l/lou+reed/images_20085273.html,"I think images are worth repeating  
Images repeated from a painting  
Images taken from a painting  
From a photo worth re-seeing  
I love images worth repeating, project them upon the ceiling  
Multiply them with silk screening  
See them with a different feeling  
Images images images images  
  
Some say images have no feeling, I think there's a deeper meaning  
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming  
Instigates a cooler feeling  
I love multiplicity of screenings  
Things born anew display new meanings  
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating  
  
I'm no urban idiot savant spewing paint without any order  
I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma  
What I paint is very ordinary  
I don't think I'm old or modern, I don't think I think  
I'm thinking  
It doesn't matter what I am thinking  
It's the images that are worth repeating  
Images images images images  
  
If you're looking for a deeper meaning, I'm as deep as this high ceiling  
If you think technique is meaning, you might find me very simple  
You might think the images boring  
Cars and cans and chairs and flowers  
You might find me personally boring  
Hammer, sickle, Mao Tse Tung, Mao Tse Tung -

I want to eradicate my negative views  
And get rid of those people who are always on a down

I took my GPZ out for a ride  
the engine felt good between my thighs  
The air felt cool, it's was forty degrees outside  
  
I rode to Pennsylvania near the Delaware Gap  
sometimes I got lost and had to check the map  
I stopped at a roadside diner for a burger and a coke  
  
There were some country folk and some hunters inside  
somebody got themselves married and somebody died  
I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song  
  
They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside  
and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside  
I love that GPZ so much, you know that I could kiss her

Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a hunk of muscle  
Call out the national guard  
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means  
From off of the formica topped bar  
And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly  
And boldly out of this world  
And despite people's derision  
Proved to be more than diversion  
Sha-la-la-la, later on  
  
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly  
And showed her where he was coming from

It's either the best or it's the worst  
Since I don't have to choose, I guess I won't  
And I know, This is no way to treat a guest  
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet  
And just lay her out in the darkest street  
And by morning, she's just another hit and run  
  
You know, some people got no choice  
And they can never even find a voice  
To talk with that they can even call their own  
So the first thing, that they see  
That allows them the right to be  
Why, they follow it  
You know, it's called bad luck

To take them away

Works out  
Neither one of us is  
The type who shouts  
You sleep in the bedroom  
While I pace up and down the hall  
Our baby stares at both of us  
Wondering which one of us to call  
I guess it's true that not  
Every match burns bright  
I guess it's true  
Not all that I say is right

Around in my head  
Who thought this could happen to us  
When we first went to bed  
I'm told in the end  
That none of this matters  
All couples have troubles  
And none of this matters  
But what you said  
Still echoes in my head  
And I'm still in the hallway  
Downstairs sleeping alone instead  
I know you don't care  
But here's my last thought  
Not that it matters  
But here's the last thing I thought  
Our little thing is lying  
Here in tatters  
And you my dear  
Don't have any manners  
Sad to leave this way  
To leave it all in tatters  
Saddening to leave this way

To teach him how to swim  
They put blood in his coffee  
And milk in his gin  
They stood over the soldier  
In the midst of the squalor  
There was war in his body  
And it caused his brain to holler  
Make the sacrifice  
Mutilate my face  
If you need someone to kill  
I'm a man without a will  
Wash the razor in the rain  
Let me luxuriate in pain  
Please don't set me free  
Death means a lot to me  
The pain was lean and it made him scream  
He knew he was alive  
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest  
He thought he was a saint  
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother  
What am I to do  
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car  
It cannot be controlled  
Spit upon his face and scream  
There's no oedipus today  
This is no play you're thinking you are in  
What will you say  
Take the blue mask down from my face  
And look me in the eye  
I get a thrill from punishment  
I've always been that way  
I loathe and despise repentance  
You are permanently stained  
Your weakness buys indifference  
And indiscretion in the streets  
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not  
You deserve to be soundly beat  
Make the sacrifice  
Take it all the way  
There's no ""won't"" high enough  
To stop this desperate day  
Don't take death away  
Cut the finger at the joint  
Cut the stallion at his mount  
And stuff it in his mouth

Louis Jordan,"Jack, You're Dead!",/l/louis+jordan/jack+youre+dead_20809522.html,"When you've got no more assurance  
Than a great big hunk of lead  
And if you don't respond to romance  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
When a chick is smiling at you  
Even though there's nothing said  
If you stand there like a statue  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
You've been always kicking  
But you stubbed your toes  
When you ups and kicks the bucket  
Just like old man mose  
  
When you get no kicks from loving  
And you blow your top instead  
It's a fact that you ain't living  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
If you just ain't got nobody  
Since you've gone and lost your head  
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
What's the use of having muscles  
When your life hangs by a thread  
If you ain't got no red corpuscles  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
You've been always kicking  
But you stubbed your toes  
When you ups and kicks the bucket  
Just like old man mose  
  
When you get no kicks from loving  
And the news begins to spread  
All the cats will holler, ""Murder!""  
Jack, you're dead!  
  
All the breath is leaked out of you  
When your friends gather 'round the bed  
Look at you and say, ""Don't he look natural""  
When that happens to you, daddy  
Jack, you're dead!

Louis Jordan,Saturday Night Fish Fry,/l/louis+jordan/saturday+night+fish+fry_20835400.html,"Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans  
Then you can understand just what I mean  
All through the week, it's quiet as a mouse  
But on Saturday night, they go from house to house  
  
You don't have to pay the usual admission  
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician  
So if you happen to be just passin' by  
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem  
Foolin' around just me and him  
We decided we could use a little something to eat  
So we went to a house on Rampart Street  
  
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease  
And a lush little miss said, ""Come in, please""  
And before we could even bat an eye  
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life  
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife  
Over in the corner was a beat up grand  
Being played by a big fat piano man  
  
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks  
Some of them had on bobbie socks  
But everybody was nice and high  
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'  
The bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'  
And way up above all the noise they made  
Somebody hollered, ""Better get out of here, this is a raid""  
  
Now I didn't know we was breakin' the law  
But somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw  
They had us blocked off from the front to the back  
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potato sacks  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
I knew I could get away if I had a chance  
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance  
Now I tried to crawl under a bathtub  
When the policeman said, ""Where you goin' there, bub?""  
  
Now they got us out of there like a house afire  
Put us all in that Black Maria  
Now, they might have missed a pitiful few  
But they got poor me and my buddy too  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
We headed for jail in a dazed condition  
They booked each one of us on suspicion  
Now my chick came down and went for my bail  
And finally got me out of that rotten jail  
  
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye  
Just mention a Saturday night fish fry  
I don't care how many fish in the sea  
But don't ever mention a fish to me  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Give me one of them, their fish sandwiches  
Get away from there, boy, yowza

There was a time when I

Do you remember  
The love that we once had

I would make your heart forget I was ever bad  
If we forgive the past  
I know this time love would last  
Forever, for always, for love  
  
I'm not coming home anymore  
Does it matter?  
Well, if I had the chance to hold you again  
I would fill your heart with joy  
And make you know that I'm the only one for you  
Let's throw the bad memories out  
And make this the first day of our  
Forever, for always, for love

Luther Vandross,Miss-You Game,/l/luther+vandross/miss+you+game_20623431.html,"Been so long since we brokeup  
But it still feels just the same  
Still feels like I'm a pawn  
Playing the miss-you game.  
  
The same sun rises and then it sets  
The waves toss and turn and break  
The clocks tick away louder each time  
But I still lie here awake.  
  
The croked smile still appiers  
When some one mentions your name  
Gonna be a victom forever  
A victom of this miss-you game.  
  
Time is the only strong whip  
That can make my wild passions tame  
Till then I'm on the board forever  
Dragging on the miss you game.

Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels,  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things.  
  
When the dog bites, when the bee stings

I just simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad.  
  
The girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,  
The snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,  
Silver white winters that melt into springs

Begin to mean so much

Just to make sure things get stronger

You tell me that you love me  
And before I'm sure you really do  
You say you love me more and more each day

Just say the right thing baby and it's automatic love

Off into lovers' land  
Just when you touch my hand

Luther Vandross,Nights In Harlem,/l/luther+vandross/nights+in+harlem_20274714.html,"There's a party in Harlem, come on  
  
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed  
It was somewhere one night in Harlem  
The nights were hot and bright  
You could treat your honey right  
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night  
  
The people there were really something  
(You know that's right)  
The music always kept us jumping  
And it used to knock me down  
When Smokey came to town  
(And the miracles, please)  
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah  
  
There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
And I'm gonna take my baby back  
To the heart of Harlem  
  
Big sister had a group  
And they'd sit out on the stoop  
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)  
My cousin Joe could blow  
Just like the radio  
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild  
  
But when grandma started happy dancing  
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')  
She really turned the mother out  
I like the way they do it up in Harlem  
When there's a party up in Harlem  
That's what it's all about  
  
Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo  
  
There's a party in Harlem  
They say that all the stars will be there  
Everyone is going to Harlem  
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there  
  
Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around  
Originally everybody headed uptown  
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car  
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R  
And yes, we are about to set it  
Forget it, I thought you knew  
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew  
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac  
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back  
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance  
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant  
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch  
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much  
It's such a love flow, high but natural  
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no  
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool  
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool  
  
Nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They don't let you fake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my honey  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem

Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby

Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck  
Said I know a place called the broken wheel where we can try our luck  
Five miles north of 66, behind old man lester's barn  
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sheriff claims that he don't

I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear

When the door flew open, she came out screamin'  
Drive fool drive!

I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me

That the best things in life don't come so easily  
  
I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me  
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree  
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far  
If your lookin' for trouble step outside of this bar  
If it comes down to fistin', mister that ain't nothin' new to me

I wasn't born under no bad sign, but it was Friday the 13th  
East, west, no, yes  
  
Hot, cold, tell you this  
Ain't nothin' in between  
Its either good luck -- I'm the last to get it  
Bad luck -- I'm the first  
  
When its good, ain't nothin' better  
When its bad, ain't nothin' worse  
  
Well life can be a little hard sometimes, you do what you gotta do  
A lot depends on the luck a man has and the cards that's been dealt to you  
I'd fold this hand if I could or at least take a card or two  
  
I been around  
Had my ups and downs  
Tell me does it sound little like you  
  
Good luck -- I'm the last to get it  
Bad luck -- I'm the first  
When its good, ain't nothin' better  
When its bad, ain't nothin' worse

As the rain pours off his hat

Now the cannons are silent  
His friends are all gone  
Gotta put it all behind him  
If he ever wants to find his way home  
He's the last rebel on the road  
  
Just a boy with his old guitar  
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong  
But he carries on  
Got a dream that will never die  
Can't change him, no use in stayin' where you don't belong  
  
Now he's rollin' down the highway  
Gone too far too fast  
No one will ever find him, he'll never look back

Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed  
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

Don't think I don't think like you  
I often get those nightmares too  
They always take some swallowing  
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum  
If it's you that you are following  
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause  
Because we might lose the Big Apple  
  
But would I have done what I did  
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known  
We would take the country

Madonna,More,/m/madonna/more_20086878.html,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,  
Which was fine with me.  
Because I had rhythm, music, love,  
The sun, the stars and the moon above,  
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.  
That was when the best things in life were free.  
  
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,  
Which is fine with me.  
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,  
But look at what I got to go with 'em.  
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.  
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.  
  
Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.  
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!  
  
Count your blessings, one, two, three  
I just hate keeping score.  
Any number is fine with me  
As long as it's more  
As long as it's more!  
  
I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition  
I find counting a bore.  
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.  
[More! More!]  
  
I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before  
Got my guy and my sky of blue,  
Now, however, I own the view.  
More is better than nothing, true  
But nothing's better than more, more, more  
Nothing's better than more.  
  
One is fun, why not two?  
And if you like two, you might as well have four,  
And if you like four, why not a few  
Why not a slew  
[More! More!]  
  
If you've got a little, why not a lot?  
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.  
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot  
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.  
[More! More!]  
  
Never say when, never stop at plenty,  
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.  
Happy with ten, happier with twenty  
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?  
  
Or does that sound too greedy?  
That's not greed, no, indeedy  
That's just stocking the store  
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.  
[More! More!]  
  
Each possession you possess  
Helps your spirits to soar.  
That's what's soothing about excess  
Never settle for something less.  
Something's better than nothing, yes!  
But nothing's better than more, more more  
[Except all, all, all]  
Except all, all, all  
Except once you have it all [have it all]  
You may find all else above [find all else above]  
That though things are bliss,  
There's one thing you miss, and that's  
More! More!  
More! More! More! More!  
More! More! More!

They cut but never change, what stood so long  
  
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky  
Life's for the taking  
  
Like a man is a mountainside  
Greatness waits for those who try  
None can teach you, it's all inside  
Just climb  
  
I am in the ground, I am in the air  
I am all, I live in the hearts of men  
I am the call to greatness  
Not all can hear  
  
I awaken the creator in those who dare  
And the day will come, when we all must die  
And enter the mountainside  
  
I have no fear  
Death and glory  
Both draw near

In visions apocalypse now seen.  
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed  
Drink the wine of his anger  
Die with the beast.  
  
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds.  
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.  
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky  
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign  
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.

Earth be cleansed in a blaze.  
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows  
Hail, fire and blood fall on satans throne.  
  
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame  
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues.  
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand  
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign

Grandmothers  
Lift your head up to the sky  
'Cause we will never say bye.  
  
As a child, there were them times  
I didn't get it, but you kept me inline  
I didn't know  
Why you didn't show up sometimes  
On Sunday mornings  
And I missed you, but what we talked through  
All them grown folk things, separation brings  
You never let me know it, you never let it show  
Because you loved me  
And so much more then to say  
If you were with me today  
Face to face.  
  
I never knew I can hurt like this  
And everyday life goes on like  
I wish I can talk to you for a while  
Wish you but try not to cry  
As time goes bye  
  
And I'm sure you reached a better place  
And still I'd give  
The world to see your face  
Me right here, next to you  
But it's like your gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing to do is say  
Bye, bye-bye  
Bye-bye

And you never got a chance to see  
How good I've done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you was here to celebrate together  
I wish that we can spend the holidays together  
I remember when you use to tuck me in at night  
Or the teddy bear you give me I held so tight  
I thought you were so strong,  
You make it through whatever  
Its so hard to accept the fact you gone forever  
  
I never knew I can hurt like this  
And everyday life goes on like this  
I wish I can talk to you for a while  
I miss you but I try not to wish

With nonsense  
All you wanna do is blab about  
Your problems  
I be making bad excuses up like  
Ooh, I gotta hang up now  
Cause the house is burning down  
But you never hear them anyway  
Cause you don't shut up  
From the second that I say hello  
I'm like ugh! You? Please no  
No I can't get in a word edgewise  
And you don't notice anyway  
You don't care about what I say

Fun for all that children call  
Their favorite time of the year  
  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times and ancient rhymes  
Of love and dreams to share  
  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there

We'll be drawing near  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year

When we fell like the snow  
So deep in love  
High above us the evergreens  
Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze  
As we made future Christmas memories.  
  
Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile  
'Cause the mistletoe is occupied  
And the dream is to share  
This Christmas cheer with you all year  
And not wait till the morning  
When Christmas time is in the air again.  
  
Mr. Grinch simply can't resist  
Warming up when he looks our way  
Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish  
For a honey to hold Christmas day  
  
And to feel love like ours always  
La da da, da da dum  
  
And the dream is to share  
This Christmas cheer  
With you all throughout the year

Mariah Carey,Circles,/m/mariah+carey/circles_10174310.html,"Ever since you left me  
I've been trying to hide the pain  
Painting on a smile with lipstick  
Putting on a big charade  
So difficult to keep pretending  
It's getting harder everyday  
It's plain to see I'm cold and heartsick  
Since you turned and walked away  
I just keep going round and round  
And round in circles  
Keep on tumbling down  
  
Oh boy my world has changed  
And I don't think I can make it without out  
Nothing's the same  
You got me running around in circles over you  
(Running around in circles over you)  
  
Saturday I saw you  
Holding hands with someone new  
Somehow I kept my composure  
Just like everything was cool  
But inside I kept repeating  
Don't you let them see you cry  
So I casually turned my head  
As the tears rolled down my eyes  
I just keep going round and round  
And round in circles  
Keep on tumbling down  
  
Oh boy my world has changed  
And I don't think I can make it without out  
Nothing's the same  
You got me running around in circles over you  
(Running around in circles over you)  
  
Everything is you  
How can I pull through  
My heart is consumed I'm so confused  
Still caught up in you...love can be so cruel  
Baby don't know how to turn you loose  
  
Oh boy my world has changed  
And I don't think I can make it without you  
No, nothing's the same  
You got me running around  
And running around  
And running around  
Nothing's the same  
Baby baby cause you  
Got me running around  
In circles over you

Mariah Carey,Close My Eyes,/m/mariah+carey/close+my+eyes_20088390.html,"I was wayward child  
With the weight of the world  
That I held deep inside  
Life was a winding road  
And I learned many things  
Little ones shouldn't know  
  
But I closed my eyes  
Steadied my feet on the ground  
Raised my head to the sky  
And though time's rolled by  
Still feel like that child  
As I look at the monn  
Maybe I grew up  
A little too soon  
  
Funny how one can learn  
To grow numb to the madness  
And block it away  
I left the worst unsaid  
Let it all dissipate  
And I try to forget  
  
But I closed my eyes  
Steadied my feet on the ground  
Raised my head to the sky  
And though time's rolled by  
Still feel like that child  
As I look at the monn  
Maybe I grew up  
A little too soon  
  
Nearing the edge  
Oblivious I almost  
Fell right over  
A part of me  
Will never be quite able  
To feel stable  
That woman-child falling inside  
Was on the verge of fading  
Thankfully I  
Woke up in time  
  
Guardian angel I  
Sail away on an ocean  
With you by my side  
Orange clouds roll by  
They burn into your image  
And you're still alive  
(You're always alive)  
  
But I closed my eyes  
Steadied my feet on the ground  
Raise my head to the sky

My fucking N two way  
I should've never listened  
To your woeful stories  
The ones I'm sure you  
Told a thousand times before me  
You should've never intimated  
We were lovers  
When you know very well  
We never even touched each other  
  
Who's gonna love you when  
It all falls down, and  
Who's gonna love you when  
Your bankroll runs out  
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over  
When the star of the  
Show isn't you anymore  
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown  
Fall down...  
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown  
Fall down

Takin' my g5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'  
But I guess you wouldn't know  
That's the way I roll  
Consequently now your ego's fully  
Overblown  
You don't want the world to know  
That you're just a puppet show  
And the little boy inside  
Often sits at home alone  
And cries, cries, cries, cries  
(Boo hoo. Who?)

What will your life become  
Sure you hide it  
But you're lost and lonesome  
Still just a frail shook one

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown

Fall down...

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown

Makin' me high

It don't stop  
He cruised beside me now  
I'm flyin', drivin'  
  
Through yellow lights  
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide  
Driver's Education 101  
Slipped out of my mind  
I need me a caddy  
With some cruise control  
No, no, no

But uh ooh

Just want to kiss 'em

Might need to go slow, I don't know  
Why ease up on the break  
Every time I see his face  
I'm outta control, ah I don't know  
How to stay up in my lane  
Every day and night  
He's cruisin' through my brain  
  
Wherever I go he be cruisin'  
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it  
Deep down inside don't want to lose him

Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block

You put your hand in cruise control  
And you deny me if you want  
And you will starve yourself of love  
If you don't speed and break the law  
You can't get no speeding ticket  
On the highway to my heart  
And it might be a rocky road  
And you can exit if you want(Why you always..)  
Look at life just like a pessimist  
You already like a wife up in my premises  
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis  
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

Is a song I wrote  
When we first got together  
Early that September

Pour another glass or two

Why it gets so hard  
Tears you all apart

Suddenly you're here  
And it's so surreal

Thinking what it could've been like  
If we had another try (one time)  
Like back in the day  
That look on your face  
Feels like, the first time  
  
Them other irregularities  
They can't compete with MC  
The whole entire world can tell  
That you love yourself some me  
  
People see ya know  
Asking all about  
Me and how they always thought we  
Were so perfect together  
  
Let's re-write the end  
Start over again  
And it's gon go better now

No matter what you do  
And for the record  
Can't nobody say  
I didn't give my all to you

I told you underneath the stars  
That you belong to me

We just can't let go of us, honey

Lighting a ray of hope for me

Free to live  
Free to laugh  
Free to soar  
Free to shine  
Free to give  
Free to love

You know who you are  
  
Hmm hmm hmm  
When glory days turn to stormy nights  
You must have been so petrified  
Didn't you, didn't you feel so cold  
You against the world in a losing fight  
Captive of your demons inside  
  
So you sought an enemy  
(I'm not your enemy. He lives in you, you know it's true)  
Like times before to mock ignorantly  
(But the Lord said love, love your enemy so just...)  
Take heed to the Word it's time  
Check Proverbs 19:29  
Don't cry  
  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
I truly wanted solidarity  
Still wearing my blinders back then  
(So much I didn't see)  
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be  
I'll keep you in prayer till the end  
  
Still bruised, still walk on eggshells  
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself  
(Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you)  
But you can't manipulate me like before  
Examine first John chapter 4 verse 4  
  
And  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
Be strong in the Lord and power of His might  
  
If my shows of gratitude are minuscule  
Inside your mind, sorry  
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)  
There's only so much I can do I love you and did all that I could  
  
Maybe when you're cursing me  
You don't feel so incomplete  
But we've all made mistakes  
Felt the guilt and self-hate  
  
I know you've been there for me plenty  
Maybe still got love for me  
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren  
But who remains standing then  
Not you not I see Philippians 4:9  
(Put it into practice and the God of Peace will be with you)  
  
So  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
I wish you well  
  
(He who the Son sets free is free indeed)  
No weapon formed against me shall prosper  
Surely God is my salvation  
I will trust and not be afraid  
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation  
I will trust in Him  
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know  
  
But I have had God's help to this very day  
And so I stand here and testify  
To small and great alike  
So the more you curse me  
The more you're blessing me  
The Word said it  
Love your enemies  
  
Do good to those who curse you  
Pray for those who mistreat you  
Psalms 129:2  
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth  
But they have not gained victory over me  
(In Jesus' name)  
  
I wish you well  
  
He that keeps his mind state on the Lord  
He will keep them in perfect peace

Since our last kiss goodbye  
Picture you in my mind  
And I can't seem to rationalize  
The way we let it end  
It just don't make no sense  
This can't be happening  
I need you back again

Like we're some kind of obsession  
For the millionth time asking I'm like  
""Uh let it rest""  
Can i get a minute to breathe  
They're like ""Nope,  
What's up with you and so-so?""

We gon' kiss away the hurt

No

Once upon a time  
You whispered softly in my ear  
Loving words and fairytales  
That I longed to hear  
I gave you my body and soul  
And you took control  
As you slowly swept me up  
And carried me away  
  
You told me pretty lies  
As I held onto you tight  
You knew how to get your way  
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday

I drown in thoughts of yesterday  
And the fools' paradise that you blew away  
I feel you beside me again  
And remember when you came to my window  
On a dark and stormy day  
  
Baby, I need you now  
Tonight I'm crumbling down (down)  
Sinking in the memories  
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Have come to wither  
I thought I'd done my best to memorize  
A picture fades of you and I together  
I haven't come to terms  
With how we said goodbye  
  
Did you really care  
Care at all for me  
Did you really care  
Did you care at all for me  
  
A displaced little girl  
Wept tears in silence  
And whispered wishes you'd materialize  
She pressed on night and day  
To keep on living  
And tried so many ways  
To keep her soul alive  
  
Did you really care  
Care enough for me  
Did you really care  
Did you care at all for me  
  
If I'm not quite good enough  
Or somehow undeserving of  
A mother's love  
  
You could have had the decency  
To give me up  
Before you gave me life  
  
Don't you even care  
Just the slightest little bit for me  
Cause I really need to feel you cared  
Even once upon a time for me  
I need to believe, in my heart of hearts, you care for me  
I need to understand  
Why you left me there so helplessly  
  
Don't you even care  
Care at all for me

It's M.C. and Y.J.  
Another hit, okay  
We lookin' fine  
Takin' off  
Saw us on a runway  
On any given Sunday  
Monday, Tuesday  
They try to confuse me  
I never let 'em use me  
  
(Mariah Carey):  
I was a girl  
You was a man  
I was too young  
To understand  
I was naive  
I just believed  
Everything  
That you told me  
Said you were strong  
Protecting me  
Then I found out  
That you were weak  
Keepin' me there  
Under your thumb  
Cause you were scared  
That I'd become much  
More than you could handle  
Shining like a chandelier  
That decorated  
Every room inside  
The private hell we built  
And I dealt with it  
Like a kid  
I wished  
I could fly away  
  
But instead  
I kept my tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin' up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming 'bout  
The violent times  
Still little protective  
'Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin' folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal

It didn't stop  
No one was there  
Couldn't be real  
Had to keep quiet  
Once in awhile  
Put up a fight  
It's just too much  
Night after night  
After awhile  
I would just lie  
You was dead wrong  
Said you was right  
Did what I could  
Just to survive  
Couldn't believe  
This was my life  
Flickering like a candle  
Do my best to handle  
Sleeping with the enemy  
Whether he was smothering  
Every last part of me  
So I broke away  
And finally found  
The strength to leave  
  
Still kept the tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up

To keep the world from knowin' what's inside.

I'm the one that taught you how to love.  
And boy I gave you all of me,  
Parts of affection you couldn't see.  
As you embrace her in your arms give her ""my all""  
Give her more than you gave to me.  
  
When you had nothing I gave.  
When you were weak I made you brave.  
You went and leave me with the scars on my heart,  
It's funny how ya'll forget it all.

You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability  
Got up and laid all your possessions  
Outside the kitchen window right now  
  
Letting go, letting go ain't easy

Reverberating in my ears

And the anger burns in me  
I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting baby  
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need  
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so  
Go to MiMi on your contacts, press delete

She thought she really meant it, that's the honest truth  
She felt it in her marrow, she felt it in her boots

He adored the chaos, smashing all the delft

He was Irish Catholic, she had English blood  
They met in a good restaurant, they gave the secret nod  
She ordered fish and lentils, he the kidney stew  
She played with bold impulses, wine turned his lips blue  
They left in separate taxis to the same address  
In case someone was watching, and there they did confess  
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire  
  
It was all the others' fault, they thought at any rate  
After the ceasefire to put an end to hate  
She was reaching for her knife, he a fork and spoon  
They sat about devouring the poison of the moon  
Shared a fatal cigarette neither one would light  
Their breath was flame enough, nobody said goodnight

The boulevard of broken dreams  
Where gigolo and gigolette  
Can take a kiss without regret  
So they forget their broken dreams.  
  
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow  
When you behold your shattered schemes.  
And gigolo and gigolette  
Wake up to find their eyes are wet  
With tears that tell of broken dreams.  
  
Here is where you'll always find me,  
Always walking up and down,  
But I left my soul behind me  
In an old cathedral town.  
  
The joy that you find here, you borrow,  
You cannot keep it long it seems.  
But gigolo and gigolette  
Still sing a song and dance along  
The boulevard of broken dreams.  
  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

Abandoning the relics in my playground of yesterday  
I'm losing on the swings, I'm losing on the roundabouts

Too late to say I love you, too late to re-stage the play  
The game is over  
I act the role in classic style of a martyr carved with twisted smile  
To bleed the lyric for this song to write the rites to right my wrongs  
An epitaph to a broken dream to exercise this silent scream  
A scream that's borne from sorrow  
I never did write that love song, the words just never seemed to flow  
Now sad in reflection did I gaze through perfection  
And examine the shadows on the other side of the morning  
And examine the shadows on the other side of mourning  
Promised wedding now a wake  
The fool escaped from paradise will look over his shoulder and cry  
Sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer why?  
As you grow up and leave the playground  
Where you kissed your prince and found your frog  
Remember the jester that showed you tears, the script for tears  
So I'll hold our peace forever when you wear your bridal gown  
In the silence of my shame the mute that sang the sirens' song  
Has gone solo in the game, I've gone solo in the game  
But the game is over

With the bayonets of thorns repelling  
Small children in search of lost tennis balls

He looks at the earring.  
""Fag,"" he mumbles.  
I don't mind.  
He's fat.  
No one likes him.  
Life's too short.  
I pass a table of black girls  
With short hair.  
They look like men.  
They all look the same.  
I can hear the strobe now,  
It's loud.  
And the music's too bright.  
I look for my friends,  
But I can't remember if I came alone  
Or not.  
Doesn't matter though.  
There's hundreds of people  
Who have waited all their lives,  
No doubt,  
To be my friend.  
And as I near the bar  
I see two persons  
Eating each other's faces.  
I bark to the bartender.  
He gives me a placebo.  
I'm ""so young,"" he tells me,  
""To be here.""  
I nod and swallow the bland drink.  
Then I stumble several times  
Near a crowd,  
And they think I'm a good dancer.  
I hear a girl tell another girl  
That some girl she knows  
Watched a  
Girl  
Puke in the toilet.  
I smile in their general direction.  
The good-looking one comes over  
And bites my cheek.  
It hurts,  
And I start to  
Hit her.  
But she's grinning,  
And I can see my blood on her teeth.  
And I pull her to me.  
""My place or yours?""  
""The gutter will be fine,"" she confesses.  
As we walk out,  
She takes another bite from my cheek,  
And I smile at the fat man  
By the door.

Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

'Cause all I wanted to be  
Was a million miles from here  
Somewhere more familiar  
  
Too much time spent dragging the past up  
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up  
Settling down in your early twenties  
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

Does it burn

You look at me  
I look at you  
Neither of us know what to do  
  
There may not  
Be another way to your heart  
So I guess I'd better find a new way in  
I shiver when i hear your name  
Think about you but it's not the same  
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin  
  
Immobilized by the thought of you  
Paralyzed by the sight of you  
Hypnotized by the words you say  
Not true but I believe 'em anyway

Mary Black,Crusader,/m/mary+black/crusader_20089919.html,"There's a wilderness  
It's a no man's land  
Between alice springs and the ocean  
Seventeen hundred miles of burning sand  
And a silken thread keeps a hold on you  
When the emptieness like a potion tends to fray your reason strand by strand  
And there's no more need for the mask your wear  
When the last goodbyes have been said  
So kiss the cheeks of you dearest friends  
And turn to the desert ahead  
Now you're on your own like a sailing ship  
You're the captain, crew and sailors  
Turn around and this is what you see  
Chorus  
This me facing me all alone  
'cause I choose to be with the wind and the sun on me only me  
Now you dream so much about being lost  
Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping  
Haunts you and whispers in your ear  
Give up give up this lonely road  
No one knows the promise you're keeping  
You can't touch the emptiness out here  
But the grace that mends this broken wing  
The blue sky to regain  
Will lift those feet and raise those eyes  
To face the desert again  
As the dawn reveals the journey's end  
In truth it's only beginning  
And it's as big as your eyes wish to see

Mary Black,Dockland,/m/mary+black/dockland_20089962.html,"Late glow on an early winter evening in Dockland  
With my ship of dreams moving easily across the sound  
Reminiscence is weighing me down with a vengeance  
Tide water so deep I think I'm going to drown  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I don't even have to try and I'm gone out of here without notice  
Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world  
  
It didn't hit me when I met you coming out of the shambles  
It didn't hit me when you took me to the summer field  
I didn't flinch when you told me that you'd get what you wanted  
I never had what it takes to have a heart of steel  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold

I'm gone out Dockland without a care in the world  
Gone out of Dockland  
  
Yes, I loved you the time that is was  
And yes, you may rip me whenever you want  
  
So it goes on a crystal-clear morning in Dockland  
And heaven knows if I'll ever live to love again  
Struck down by the kiss of an angel in limbo  
Laid low by the act of the going  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold

Matt Monro,Alfie,/m/matt+monro/alfie_21027993.html,"What's it all about, Alfie?  
Is it just for the moment we live?  
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?  
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind?  
  
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,  
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.  
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,  
What will you lend on an old golden rule?  
  
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,  
I know there's something much more,  
Something even non-believers can believe in.  
I believe in love, Alfie.  
  
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.  
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.  
When you walk let your heart lead the way  
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.

Screwed her eyes up, had a peep  
Saw the marchers, heard their voices  
Making early morning noises  
Stumbled back to bed and tried to sleep  
  
Come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change the world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world

Went the marchers, spirits low  
Grunting greetings, grimly pressing  
Onto where they had to go  
  
When the sun came up, they brightened  
Stopped to have their thermos brew  
Annie Harris got up gladly  
Pondered for a little, sadly  
Then got on with what she had to do

When we've rearranged your world

'Up the marches', banners go  
Chanting, shouting out with leaflets  
Protest for everyone to know  
  
Sit in front of all the traffic  
Harried, busy shopping wives  
Try to stir their ostrich notions  
Whip them up to wild emotions  
Put some fire into their wretched lives

You'll be amazed, so full of praise

By a policeman from the road  
Margaret Beatty had her face slapped  
By a man she tried to goad

Paused in typing, thought of Don  
Glanced again at his last letter  
Died for others to live better  
Brushed away a tear and carried on  
  
Come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change the world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world

Oh when sunny gets blue

Like the winds that sway the trees.  
Winds that set the leaves a-sway  
Like the violins that play  
Strange and haunting melodies

And see her smile  
That's how she got her name  
Since that sad affair  
She's lost her smile  
Changed her style  
Somehow she's not the same  
The memories come back  
And pretty dreams rise up  
Where the other dreams fell through  
Hurry new love, hurry here  
Kiss away each lonely tear  
Hold me near when

She's a nothing, a no one, she's undone  
Broken dreams, stolen freedom  
Trapped in the night, trafficked and beaten  
All a part of an evil economy  
Nothing more than someone's commodity  
A precious being like you and me  
A daughter, a sister, a somebody!  
  
She was drawn by the bright lights  
She was tied up in their lights  
She worked right through the daylight  
No voice, she's a slave to the night  
  
27 million like me  
(That's 27 million on this cruel journey)  
  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up

Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
  
After the man left, she's nothing left  
No one, no love, no one to call her friend  
She's stuck in the pit of hell  
She's almost sick from the smell  
She's numb, she's dead from the inside out  
Her heart is screaming but you don't hear the shout  
Who's the voice? Who's gonna break the door down?  
Who wakes her up from the nightmare now?

We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
  
27 million, are you joking?  
How did we let evil get so tight a grip  
Watching while the world falls apart?  
How did we let this stuff begin?  
We're not bothered if this offends  
Cause you got people that can depend  
But they ain't got that, they got nothing  
Sometimes you gotta stand for something  
Let this be the stand against your blood running  
  
Little girl don't cry  
Let me dry your eyes in the darkest night  
(You're not alone)  
Hold on through the storm  
You're not on your own  
Hold on, love will come

Living now for You, and everything I think  
All I say and do is for You, my Lord.  
  
Now, taking up the cross, walking on Your paths,  
Holding out Your truth running in this race,  
Bowing every day, all for You, my Lord.  
  
And what I have vowed I will make good.  
Every promise made will be fulfilled  
'Till the day I die, every day I live  
Is for You, is for You, is for You,  
Is for You, is for You, is for You,  
  
Earth has nothing I desire that lives outside of You,  
I'm consumed with You. Treasures have no hold,  
Nothing else will do, only You, my Lord.

Meat Loaf,A Man And A Woman,/m/meat+loaf/a+man+a+woman_20091256.html,"And the band began to play, without a song they'd lose their way  
A song of love and custom dreams, a song of yesterday  
When they danced, when they danced, her skirts were lifted high  
She felt the music in his arms, the danger in his eyes  
And a woman said no, and a man said ""but I love you so""  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""Take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side""  
  
It happened all too fast, they came to love and they came to last  
No-one remembers now who lied, true love is made of glass  
And a woman said ""change"", and a man said ""as soon as I can""  
And a woman said ""open up"", and a man said  
""Your way's right, you're my love, I won't be holdin' you down""  
  
In the evening of their lives, no regrets and clear blue skies  
They meet again in old New York, he tells her one sweet lie  
  
And they danced and they danced, and a man said ""I love you so""  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side""

And when it appears  
We can challenge the world with our sweat and our tears.  
Through winning and losing,  
The brave never bend,  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Time can change anything... And mend any fall.  
The moment of truth is facing us all,  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,  
It's a time for the hero in us all.  
  
We carry the flame  
For all to see  
The fire and the passion, of what we can be.  
Sometimes we must fight,  
But we never bend  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Love can change anything... It's inside of us all  
To reach out a hand whenever we fall.  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,

Forever young  
May you stay forever young  
  
May your hand always be busy  
And your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
  
May your heart always be joyful  
And your song may it be sung  
And may you stay forever young  
  
Forever young  
Forever young

Meat Loaf,Hot Patootie,/m/meat+loaf/hot+patootie_10177811.html,"What ever happened to Saturday night?  
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright  
It don't seem the same since cosmic light  
Came into my life, I thought I was divine  
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go  
And listen to the music on the radio  
A saxophone was blowing on a Rock and Roll show  
We climbed in the back seat, really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
  
(Saxophone solo)  
  
My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled  
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt  
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt  
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  
Get back in front and put some hair oil on  
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song  
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along  
It felt pretty good, woo!  
Really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul

Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together  
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive

In every way I want you out of my life  
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back  
  
In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close  
And then you'd hold me so tight  
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all  
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light  
  
And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud  
I know you're laughing at me  
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies  
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free

They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance  
Bless all the girls who are always alone  
They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone

Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs  
  
I treasure your love  
I never want to lose it  
You've been through the fires of hell  
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it  
  
I treasure your love  
I want to show you how to use it  
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt  
And I know you've got the scars to prove it  
  
Remember everything that I told you  
And I'm telling you again that it's true  
When you're alone and afraid  
And you're completely amazed  
To find there's nothing anybody can do  
  
Keep on believing  
And you'll discover baby  
  
There's always something magic  
There's always something new  
And when you really, really need it the most  
That's when rock and roll dreams come through  
  
The beat is yours forever  
The beat is always true  
And when you really need it the most  
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you  
  
Once upon a time was a backbeat  
Once upon a time all the chords came to life  
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings  
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night  
  
I treasure your love  
I never want to lose it  
And you've been through the fires of hell  
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it  
  
I treasure you love  
I want to show you how to use it  
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt  
And I know you've got the scars to prove it  
  
Remember everything that I told you  
And I'm telling you again that it's true  
You're never alone 'cause you can put on the phones  
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do  
  
Keep on believing  
And you'll discover baby  
  
There's always something magic  
There's always something new  
And when you really, really need it the most

An' you've been cryin', want me to love you like I did before  
Girl when it comes to you, you know I've got no choice  
  
You put a storm inside me, I want to head for a safer harbor  
They all tell me I should give you up, but no man coulda tried any harder  
Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin' me, just want to feel you in my arms again

Like a sailor to a siren, like a moth to a flame  
I know your love might be the death for me, but I run to you just the same  
Like a sailor to a siren, nothing's gonna keep us apart  
Crashin' over the wreckage of all the sailor's broken hearts  
  
Musta met you when we were livin' in another time  
Had nothin' but the jealous gods to point our way  
When men were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore  
Wailin' like a siren leadin' him astray  
  
I got another woman and I know you got another man  
They all tell me I should give you up, but I don't think that any mortal can

And kindness is the most precious thing.

Or in the underground  
  
From SF out to Old Bridge  
NY back to LA  
The world of metal changed forever  
Back in the day  
Well that was back in the day  
  
And if you weren't there  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Because you wouldn't understand  
Live to die and die to play  
Every day and place  
Leave a path of metal  
Across the world from stage to stage  
Well that was back in the day  
  
And if you weren't there  
It doesn't matter anyway

In denim and leather  
We were all part of one force  
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass  
And put metal on the course  
  
Higher!  
Higher!  
Higher!  
Higher!  
  
Back in the day  
You weren't there  
It doesn't mater  
Because you wouldn't understand  
This is our way of life  
A life that was born free  
To follow orders how to live  
Was never meant to be  
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting  
  
The power hits the stage  
The music was exciting  
The mania raged  
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
We all had the fever  
Our ears started to ring  
Feeding this wildfire  
Consuming everything  
  
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
Metal's King back then  
And still is this today  
Others imitate or challenge  
But it never goes away  
On, oh-oh, oh-oh

An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill.  
And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls.  
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes.  
The ceremony is sure to be cursed.  
They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst.  
Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave.

Insomnia, stirring deep inside  
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights  
I can't sleep - Insomnia  
I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up  
The madness I must tame  
My candle is burning - I keep waking up  
Both ends again today  
The whole house is creaking  
I know they're out there  
The things kept from sight  
I beg to the shadows  
I can't sleep  
Insomnia, footsteps on the walk  
Insomnia, I hear someone knock  
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream  
Insomnia, can you hear me scream

On the street in hushed tones  
Oh the stories they'd tell  
If anyone would listen  
  
You come from a town where  
People don't bother saying hello  
Unless somebody's born or dies  
  
And I come from a place where they  
Drag your hopes through the mud  
Because their own dreams are all dying  
  
And when we walk down the street  
The wind sings our name in rebel songs  
The sounds of the night should make us anxious  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you  
Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise  
  
There's so many fighting  
To get past the Pearly Gates  
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved  
  
Their intentions aren't that good  
And I can smell the asphalt  
That's their personal road to hell being paved  
  
And when we walk down the street  
The wind sings our name in rebel songs  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you  
Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise  
  
I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you

Poisoned with fear watch it twist

A walking mistake but every time

And fall on my sword or light a fire

And plays the confidence game

I knew I had to have you  
Thus started the chase  
I knew I would do anything to take your hand and make you mine

If you love someone you have to let it go  
Let it go, Let it go

Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

Beneath the venomous moonlight  
I unleash my plan to watch you fail  
The one I am so ?  
Go to sleep my love  
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips  
Sealed with a kiss  
  
I return to the masquerade ball  
And hear the news of your weeping  
Stone by stone imbued in the wall  
Forever left for safekeeping  
Go to sleep my love  
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips  
Sealed with a kiss

The net below has rot away

And my fingers seek my veins

But nowhere safe from the storm  
And I can't bear to see  
What I've let me be  
So wicked and worn  
So as I write to you  
Of what is done and to do  
Maybe you'll understand  
And won't cry for this man  
'Cause low man is due  
Please forgive me  
My eyes seek reality  
My fingers feel for faith  
Touch clean with a dirty hand  
I touched the clean to the waste  
The trash fire is warm

And I cry to the alleyway  
Confess all to the rain

Bullets are flying  
People are dying  
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose  
Soldiers are hounding  
Bodies are mounting  
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse  
With war machines going

No mercy given to anyone hear

Swords are like lighting  
It all becomes frightening to you

The lines that crack your face  
Famine  
Your body it has torn through  
Withered in every place  
Pestilence  
For what you have had to endure  
And what you have put others through  
Death  
Deliverance for you for sure  
There is nothing you can do  
  
So gather round young warriors now  
And saddle up your steeds  
Killing scores with demon swords  
Now is the death of doers of wrong  
Swing the judgment hammer down  
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Your life of reason  
I want you on the floor  
And in a coffin your soul shaking  
I want to have you doubting  
Every meaning you've amassed  
Like a fortune  
  
Oh throw it away  
  
For worship someone  
Who actively despises you  
For worship someone

Sittin' here beside me

Of the gold that you must give  
  
Pain and evil have their place  
Sitting here beside me  
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you

I want to see you give it up, give it up

Metallica,Welcome Home (Sanitarium),/m/metallica/welcome+home+sanitarium_20342704.html,"Welcome to where time stands still  
No one leaves and no one will  
Moon is full, never seems to change  
Just labeled mentally deranged  
Dream the same thing every night  
I see our freedom in my sight  
No locked doors, no windows barred  
No things to make my brain seem scarred  
  
Sleep my friend and you will see  
That dream is my reality  
They keep me locked up in this cage  
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage  
  
Sanitarium, leave me be  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
  
Build my fear of what's out there  
And cannot breathe the open air  
Whisper things into my brain  
Assuring me that I'm insane  
They think our heads are in their hands  
But violent use brings violent plans  
Keep him tied, it makes him well  
He's getting better, can't you tell?  
  
No more can they keep us in  
Listen, damn it, we will win  
They see it right, they see it well  
But they think this saves us from our Hell  
  
Sanitarium, leave me be  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
  
Fear of living on  
Natives getting restless now  
Mutiny in the air  
Got some death to do  
Mirror stares back hard  
Kill, it's such a friendly word  
Seems the only way  
For reaching out again.

You can take your place down on easy street  
Or just lose your mind  
Over things only money can buy  
But it's a fact of life no matter what you do  
Every stake you claim, every dream come true  
Down deep inside, these kinda things never satisfy  
Oh, love is the precious thing  
Set you free and give your heart the wings to fly  
Love is the living dream

Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
You can conquer the world, but it's never enough  
Because you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love  
  
You can carry the flame across the finish line  
You can sign your name in the sands of time  
But fortune and fame they're just things that ya leave behind  
Well, you think you got the world in the palm of your hand  
But there's one thing missin' in your promised land  
It's a thing called love, the one thing that your heart demands  
Oh, love is the rhythm of life  
In your soul is where the secret lies  
When love is lookin' through your eyes  
Every feelin' inside  
Is tellin' you somethin'

Sail full steam down the river of gold

No matter where you are  
To promise we will find a way  
To walk the road we've known

For the secrets that remain  
Soon the future becomes the past  
When I hold you again.

I had to come and get it straight from you

Someones swept your heart away  
From the look upon your face, I see it's true  
So tell me all about it, tell me bout the  
Plans you're makin  
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I suppose to live without you

How am I supposed to carry on  
When all that I've been livin for is gone  
  
I didn't come here for cryin'  
Didn't come here to break down  
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end  
And how can I blame you  
When I build my world around  
The hope that one day wed be so much  
More than friends  
And I don't wanna know the price I'm  
Gonna pay for dreaming

You assured me you wouldn't need him anymore  
But that look upon your face is too familiar  
It was long ago, but I've been there before  
  
And this song is like a movie that we might as well pretend  
From the moment as the camera closes in  
Just say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me you loved me  
I almost believed you  
  
If I'd never realized what I was asking for  
I'd be confused upon the the presence of your pain  
Though your smile cannot disguise the hurt within you  
It appears upon the mention of his name  
  
But most of all the strangest thing  
It's hard for me to bear  
That the words that should be music to my ears  
  
Say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me you loved me  
I almost believed it  
  
Sometimes I wish that you'd save that line for someone else  
Do you want me to believe what you don't believe yourself  
Well, let's not talk about it now  
In my life I've made mistakes  
This is just one chance I'll have to take  
  
So let's carry on with the story  
Try and shoot the scene again  
As the moment that the camera closes in  
Just say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me that you loved me

Carried on his shoulder, siamese cat

After he took from you everything he could steal

Watchin' the tide roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time  
  
Looks like nothin's gonna change  
Everything, everything remains the same  
I can't do what ten people tell me to do  
So I guess I'll just remain the same  
  
I'm sittin' here restin' my bones  
But this loneliness won't leave me alone  
Two thousand miles, I roam  
Just to make this dock my home  
I'm just gonna sit, on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time

When she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh  
  
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her I love her  
Yes I would give my heart gladly,  
But each day, when she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Michael Bolton,The Hunger,/m/michael+bolton/the+hunger_20092431.html,"Shadows fall  
Through the darkness we reach  
As the hunger calls  
Then you run  
To the passion that takes you over  
  
No lookin' back  
The chance will never come again  
You risk it all  
For your dream  
Won't let you go  
  
When you feel the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Alone through an endless night  
And the need's never satisfied  
  
Through these eyes  
Seen a river of tears  
Seen the strong survive  
Separate lives  
And the emptiness makes you wonder  
Blame it on love  
  
You had it all and it's not enough  
You'll never change  
A slave to the fire  
It never ends  
  
Still you've got the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Never deny your heart  
  
The need to be satisfied  
Still you feel the hunger  
The primitive right  
Of a restless breed  
Surrendering all your life  
To the true nature of the beast  
  
No looking back  
The chance will never come again  
You give it all to your dream  
It never ends

The children's carousel  
The chestnut tree  
The wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay

I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon

Not by begging on his Knees

And I've followed your feet

And if you got to sleep a moment on the road  
I will steer for you  
And if you want to work this week alone

With candy canes and silver lanes that glow.

Toys in ev'ry store,  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door.  
  
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben,  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen,  
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Ev'rywhere you go,  
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,  
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,  
Soon the bells will start,  
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart.
