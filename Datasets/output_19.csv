You know, remember that rubber legged boy?  
Mama cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease  
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece  
  
Well there's a place you really get your kicks  
It's open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony

Ain't felt this good since I don't know when  
I might not feel this good again

One of them, one of them the bedroom blues.  
She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line,  
But take the shine right off you shoes,  
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues.

In the bar you're getting drunk, I ain't in love, I ain't in luck.  
Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight.

Some face you'll never see no more.  
Let it all come down tonight.  
Keep those tears hid out of sight, let it loose, let it all come down.

Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down

We were eating eggs in Sammy's  
When the black man there drew his knife  
Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton  
As he washed his sleeveless shirt  
You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen  
The one we all called Kurt  
Come now, gentleman  
I know there's some mistake  
How forgetful I'm becoming  
Now you fixed your business straight  
I remember you in Hemlock Road  
In nineteen fifty-six  
You're a faggy little leather boy  
With a smaller piece of stick  
You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man  
Your sweat shines sweet and strong  
Your organs working perfectly  
But there's a part that's not screwed on  
Weren't you at the Coke convention  
Back on nineteen sixty-five  
You're the misbred, gray executive  
I've seen heavily advertised  
You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks  
Policemen's buttons clean  
You're the man who squats behind the man  
Who works the soft machine  
Come now, gentleman  
Your love is all I crave  
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing  
Laughing in my grave  
When the old men do the fighting  
And the young men all look on  
And the young girls eat their mothers meat  
From tubes of plasticon  
Be wary of these my gentle friends  
Of all the skins you breed  
They have a tasty habit  
They eat the hands that bleed  
So remember who you say you are  
And keep your noses clean  
Boys will be boys and play with toys  
So be strong with your beast  
Oh Rosie dear, don'tcha think it's queer  
So stop me if you please

Down on the waterfront her hair all drenched  
In spray

Her eyes were hazel her teeth were slightly curved

She sang a song to me, stuck right in my brain

She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue  
The tires were wearing thin she done a mile or two  
And when I asked her where she headed for  
(Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar)  
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge  
My nerves are shot already the road ain't all that smooth  
  
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone

Oh it's strange so strange

The way it has happened to me  
The way it just happened to me  
  
Every day outside my window  
Always minutes close to eight  
I wish he stayed a little longer  
But his bus is never late  
  
Every night we're dancing slowly  
I play the music he adores  
Like Sinatra then we're talking  
All important things for sure

Oh it's strange so strange  
What he's doing to me  
Oh so strange real strange

As they were riding by the beach some summer night  
The radio shouted out one of those songs that might just change your life  
It went like this: ""Checkin' in checkin' out  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes  
Just like fireworks in the sky""

Throwing some poems to the ports and docks  
They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.  
  
They sent me a letter full of pills and thrills  
Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.  
  
Yea they made lots of money playing folk guitar  
'Cause everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear these words of art:
""Checkin' in checkin' out  
Take it to the sky  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes

You left me breathless  
Suddenly speechless.  
  
Within the hour we were one  
Two total strangers kissing the moonlight.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry it had to die  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry.  
  
We fell in love between the nights  
Of too many lovers and too many teardrops.  
  
And fate won't resist some satin sheets  
I was so helpless  
Totally ruthless.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry you're hurt inside  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry, cry.  
  
Love is lifting you up and draggin' you down  
Makes you go round and round and round  
Time makes a stop then it's all gone  
Funny how memories keep lingering on.

Thundering venus and apollo  
And my invitation of the physical kind  
Out of control, I just tend to follow  
  
You're close to me, like the air that I breathe  
I touch too much, I never wanna leave  
  
Seems I'm under a magic spell (magic love)  
Any way I try, I just can't hide  
I'm under your magic spell (under a magic... )  
And nothing enough I'm on the hunt for your love  
  
Holding the fire out of the road  
Straight from the heart to the end of the rainbow  
Turning electric, and going for gold  
Body and soul, just has to follow

It must have been love but it's over now.  
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.  
  
Make-believing we're together,

like a teardrop in your palm.  
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

The tears on the pillow

He's the kind of love  
That makes a whirl in your mind,  
Like the tide and the time.

He fights to find peace of mind  
In these shattering eyes  
But something happens in his heart

Just in case of accidents.

The strangest song known to man.

You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
  
I read in the paper how everything's changed  
But it's all the same - it's out of the game  
I reach out and touch an endless temptation Live in a dream - the strangest
sensation  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
The lines I have written are the lines on your face  
They merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace  
And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one  
When everything's said - when everything's done  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on

Now I hope it's forever  
Ideal love flies away now  
White jacket, mmm, black tie wings too

At least not yet  
Your memory stays  
It lingers ever  
Will fade away never

She's got no money  
Well, maybe a dime

The memory of your face  
Deep in the night

Solo trips to the stars, in the sky  
Gliding so far

De luxe and delightful  
Inflatable doll  
My role is to serve you  
Disposable darling  
Can't throw you away now  
Immortal and life size  
My breath is inside you  
I'll dress you up daily  
And keep you till death sighs

I blew up your body  
But you blew my mind

When the sun conjures up  
A broken spell au clair de lune?  
  
Silhouette  
As you draw the shade  
Cloak of night  
You know it's tailor-made  
G-Plan gymnastics  
By an everglow fire  
Could never mean the same  
As summer enchantment  
By an old mill steam  
From courtly love to costly game  
Maybe I'm wrong for seeming  
Ungrateful, unforgiving  
Oh how it hurts now you're finally leaving  
I couldn't take anymore  
  
Now's the time!  
Let's hide away  
Sacred hours  
Saved from yesterday  
Boo-hoo willows weep around you still  
Mirror reflections of dew  
But waterfall pages of an open book  
Could shower new horizons soon  
Call the tune  
Will you swoon  
As I croon  
Your serenade

Are you reading me?  
Watch you walking in waltz time  
A jigsaw puzzle in tune  
Or are you faking a straight line  
To suit yourself too soon  
Rather nouveau than never  
Contemporary ideal  
  
Some natural kind of poet might slow it  
But she sells more my speed  
She sells country and modern  
Ancient western song  
Of oriental confusion  
You so right, me so wrong  
Now you're fixing to fly me  
Auto-erotic, please,  
On the break that you're gliding.  
  
Your lingerie's a gift-wrap  
Slip it to me  
Nine till five  
The daily grind  
Made-up lies  
Make up my mind  
Same machine consuming you  
Consuming you  
Oh why

I need  
Oh why love why  
She sells  
I need.

In what they say of all things  
Great and small

Preying shadows, do they ask you why?  
And in the morning through the afternoon

Mature with age  
Like leaves  
When autumn falls

Should compensate for all you're going through

Too much thinking's got you down again  
Well let your senses skip  
Stay hip  
Keep cool

You lose control  
Pressure rises  
And so I'm told  
Something's got to give  
High life ecstasy  
You might as well live  
  
I can't see  
I can't speak  
I couldn't take more than another week  
Without you, oh no  
So I will drink my fill

A little at a time, a bit each day  
All I need is time to mend a dream or two  
Then I'll forget the love you took away  
  
Morning's here again, just like the day before  
But the only change is that I love you more  
All I need is time, maybe a thousand years  
Maybe a million tears, but I need time  
  
Everybody says the pain won't last too long  
Have a lot of fun and time will fly  
It took a lot of time till love was born in me  
And it'll take some time for love to die  
  
Each and every day I spend forgetting you  
Brings another night I never quite get through  
All I need is time, maybe a thousand years  
Maybe a million tears, but I need time

That you're my every dream

Is just some evil scheme  
A memory from your lonesome past  
Keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold, cold heart?  
Another love before my time  
Made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now  
For things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said  
That makes the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold, cold heart?  
Your cold, cold heart  
There was a time when I believed  
That you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart  
Is shackled to a memory  
The more I learn to care for you  
The more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold, cold heart?

Need to howl at the midwinter moon

Those bonfire lights in the mirrored sky  
The space between wonder and why  
  
Ahh, yes to yes to ahh, ahh to yes  
Why the sun?

I wish I had that instinct  
I wish I had that drive  
  
Spirits fly on dangerous missions  
Imaginations on fire  
Focused high on soaring ambitions  
Consumed in a single desire  
  
In the grip of  
A nameless possession  
A slave to the drive of obsession  
A spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission  
  
I watch their images flicker  
Bringing light to a lifeless screen  
I walk through  
Their beautiful buildings  
And I wish I had their dreams  
  
But dreams don't need  
To have motion  
To keep their spark alive  
Obsession has to have action  
Pride turns on the drive  
  
It's cold comfort  
To the ones without it  
To know how they struggled  
How they suffered about it  
  
If their lives were  
Exotic and strange  
They would likely have  
Gladly exchanged them  
For something a little more plain  
Maybe something a little more sane  
  
We each pay a fabulous price  
For our visions of paradise  
But a spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission

Drifting through lost latitudes  
With no compass and no chart  
  
Flying through hallucination  
Distant voices, signal fires  
Lighting up my unconscious  
And the secret places of the heart

Deep reflections in disguise  
Soaring through lost altitudes  
Without wonder, without fear  
  
Symbols on a field of visions  
Behind the curtain of sleeping eyes  
On the instant of waking  
Another world of dreams appears

Dream a walk in the wilderness  
Dream unconscious recreation

Spinning around my head

Escaped me

Rush,Witch Hunt,/r/rush/witch+hunt_20120003.html,"The night is black, without a moon  
The air is thick and still  
The vigilantes gather on  
The lonely torchlit hill  
  
Features distorted in the flickering light  
Faces are twisted and grotesque  
Silent and stern in the sweltering night  
The mob moves like demons possessed  
Quiet in conscience, calm in their right  
Confident their ways are best  
  
The righteous rise  
With burning eyes  
Of hatred and ill-will  
Madmen fed on fear and lies  
To beat and burn and kill  
  
They say there are strangers who threaten us  
Our immigrants and infidels  
They say there is strangeness too dangerous  
In our theaters and bookstore shelves  
That those who know what's best for us  
Must rise and save us from ourselves  
  
Quick to judge  
Quick to anger  
Slow to understand  
Ignorance and prejudice  
And fear walk hand in hand

To walk the caves of ice  
To break my fast on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise...""  
  
I had heard the whispered tales  
Of immortality  
The deepest mystery  
From an ancient book, I took a clue  
I scaled the frozen mountain tops  
Of eastern lands unknown  
Time and man alone  
Searching for the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
To stand within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste anew the fruits of life  
The last immortal man  
To find the sacred river Alph  
To walk the caves of ice  
Oh, I will dine on honey dew  
And drink the milk of Paradise  
  
A thousand years have come and gone  
But time has passed me by  
Stars stopped in the sky  
Frozen in an everlasting view  
Waiting for the world to end  
Weary of the night  
Praying for the light  
Prison of the lost, Xanadu  
  
Xanadu,  
Held within The Pleasure Dome  
Decreed by Kubla Khan  
To taste my bitter triumph  
As a mad immortal man  
Nevermore shall I return  
Escape these caves of ice  
For I have dined on honey dew  
And drunk the milk of Paradise

Her voice was liquid fire

Exists right now  
Let's take the time, babe  
As long as the world is turning 'round  
  
How long will it take  
To make the earth a fireball  
How long will it take  
  
'Til no more life exists at all  
How long will it take  
'Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again  
  
It's up to you  
To fight the evil in your mind  
It's up to you  
The more love you give, the more you'll find  
The more love you give, the more you'll find  
  
Don't make the world a flaming stra  
Stop, stop all these senseless wars  
How long will it take  
'Til everybody will understand

And scratches my skin  
So what is wrong  
With another sin  
The bitch is hungry  
She needs to tell  
So give her inches  
And feed her well  
More days to come  
New places to go  
I've got to leave  
It's time for a show  
  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning  
It starts to shout  
Desire is coming  
It breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages  
Till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it  
With someone I choose  
The night is calling  
I have to go  
The wolf is hungry  
He runs the show  
He's licking his lips  
He's ready to win  
On the hunt tonight  
For love at first sting

Is the game I'm looking for  
The rhythm of love  
Is the heartbeat of my soul  
  
Let's reach the top together  
One night will never do  
An exploding shot of pleasure  
Is what I've got for you  
Why don't you close your eyes  
And let your feeling grow  
I make you feel the taste of life  
Until your love will flow  
Let us find together  
The beat we're longing for  
  
The rhythm of love  
Keeps me dancing on the road  
The rhythm of love  
Got the groove that hits the bone  
The rhythm of love  
Is the game I'm looking for  
The rhythm of love  
Is the heartbeat of my soul

In search of higher ground, on mountains steep  
And though with feet unsure, I still keep pressing on.  
For I am guided by the faithful one.  
  
Faithful, faithful to the end,  
My true and precious friend,  
You have been faithful,  
Faithful, so faithful to me  
  
I see your wounded hands, I touch your side  
With thorns upon your brow you bled and died  
But there's an empty tomb, a love for all who come  
And give their hearts to you, the faithful one.  
  
Faithful, faithful to the end,  
My true and precious friend,  
You have been faithful,  
Faithful, so faithful to me

I will bow down before God's only Son  
And I will lift my hands in praise for all you've done

Exploring the pleasures of sin  
Making the best of the cards I've been dealt  
Adjusting the odds so I win

Splattered red you'll find my den  
Blood dripping from the walls

Shaped and forged within the fire  
Twisted, warped, deranged I see

You're going and you know where you belong  
You said I was ill, and you were not wrong  
But I can't believe that you'd ever care  
And so, you will never care  
But these things take time  
And I know that I'm  
The most inept  
That ever stepped  
  
Oh, the alcoholic afternoons  
When we sat in your rooms  
They meant more to me  
Than any, than any living thing on earth  
They had more worth  
Than any living thing on earth  
On earth, on earth, oh ...  
  
Vivid and in your prime  
You will leave me behind  
You will leave me behind

Been around the world, I've seen every scene twice  
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice  
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice  
I do it big, fuck the rumors  
Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas  
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami

Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy  
Sippin' Chardinae, making deals with my hands free  
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me

Relax my mind and just chill  
Cause without you, none of this is real

I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter  
Blowing sticky by the zips, and they can tell  
By my rag hanging, nigga, this is Crip, but I'm chilling  
It feels so good to get away  
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee  
Coast-to-coast jetting, man, I been doing that  
What you do, just start balling? I been around the track  
Hop in Peas with the bosses  
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office  
Docking down in Manico, churching with my folks  
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat  
My life is like a movie  
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me  
Then I relax and chill

Y'all niggas know who I am y'all niggas tearing up shit  
But we got something old, and something new for y'all tonight  
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg  
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics  
  
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]  
It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go  
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga Coolio  
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'  
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive  
Using my styles like a contraceptive  
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt  
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack  
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)  
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now  
Tell me what's going on  
It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones  
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes  
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes  
Seaking of hoes, I'll get to the point  
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint  
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg  
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfucking paws  
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize  
And see where I'm coming from it's still East Side till I die  
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-why

It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World  
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World  
The Dogg's World  
  
[Kurupt]  
Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten  
See my homey Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin  
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers  
Styles vary, packing flavor like Life Savors  
Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm dumping  
I had your whole fucking block bumping  
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China  
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya  
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through  
One-two, three, you can't see me  
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics  
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets  
It's on again, it's on and popping  
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping  
I want to see some panties dropping  
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton  
(All I ever did was just use that hoe  
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)  
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news  
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes  
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs  
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it  
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked  
But it's mandatory that I kick it  
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it  
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving  
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting  
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn  
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin  
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action  
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog  
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Daz]  
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)  
Tell when (till the early morn)  
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)  
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)  
  
Diggity Daz out of the motherfucking cut once mo'  
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow  
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick  
Till I die I'm still screaming that (bitches ain't shit)  
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about  
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb  
As you groove to the gangster shit  
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique  
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk  
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want  
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high  
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

How the fuck did that happen I thought y'all niggas was rapping

Let's see what we can do  
I'm bout freaking you, and sneaking you  
Into a quiet place  
So I can look at it face to face  
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton  
I can tell, cause you like squatting  
Your last dude, he was so rotten  
And now your love is to be gotten  
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind  
But what I'm really trying to do is ready between your pantylines  
I know it seems oh so personal  
But I'm just trying to make you feel real comfortable  
I know, so, what will it be?  
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troubling me  
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?  
I got one question, answer me this then

You came by the chuuch with a whole lot of body  
Got invited to our annual pajama party  
Working that lace, I think it was the French cut  
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt  
Hiding it, should be dividing it  
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it  
And slide in it, real smooth like  
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like  
zoom boom hit the poom-poom right  
Just to get your groove right  
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it  
When you goin' let a nigga have a look at it?  
Calling all cars, yeah baby girl you a star  
But it's on you if you want to go real far  
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps

Handcuffed as I bust bout to tear shit up  
Oh what did ya think I, didn't ever think I  
Would be the one to make you blink eye, I catch you like pink-eye  
Never will there ever be another like me  
Um you can play the left, 'cause it ain't no right in me  
Out the picture out the frame out the box I knock em all  
Smack em out the park, like A Friendly Game of Baseball  
Grand, slam, yes I am  
Kicking up dust and I don't give a god damn!  
Cause I'm that lyrical murderer  
Pleading guilty, you know for my skills I'm about to be  
Filthy large, Rage in charge  
You know what's happenin don't try to play large  
This ain't no Rerun, see hun, don't ya want to be one  
A cover, word to wreck ya, cause I never get my vocals  
I'm loco, close to Constantinople,  
I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa  
Puffin stuff, hey yo Snoop, you're up  
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck!  
  
This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era  
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror  
And I see motherfuckers trying to be like me  
Every since I put it down with the D-are-E  
  
Foaming at the mouth and wagging his tail  
Searching through the yards with a keen sense of smell  
Looking for the business in heat  
And when he find it he'll be sniffing her seat  
We travel in packs and we do it from the back  
How else can you get to the booty?  
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle  
Yo motherfucking hoes  
He fucked the fleas off a bitch  
He shacked the ticks off his dick  
And in the booty, he buries his motherfucking bone  
And if there's any left over  
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home  
  
Damn, that Tanqueray is talking to a nigga  
I ain't bullshitting, one of y'all niggas gotta get it  
Man I got ta piss

He ain't tripping, I ain't tripping, but y'all niggas still dissing  
Look here bitch, some of these niggas'll never get it  
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip  
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin  
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is ""The Villain""  
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chilling  
Now as time fly I see the game getting mo' reala  
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?  
I always tend to come with it  
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it  
Too young to retire, I'm having fun wit it  
When you learn what to do with it I'll be done with it  
Come with it

And they thought we fell off  
Fell all up in your motherfucking ass

I hate water! I can't swim!

Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me,  
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me,  
Show us how you do it uncle snoopy,  
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me,  
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,  
Gettin' interviewed by motherfuckers like geraldo,  
And niggas wanna know if I smoke newports or marlboros?  
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?  
I make that shit for the realest of millions,  
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',  
And oh what a relief it is,  
That snoop is back in dis motherfucker handlin' his biz,  
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,  
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz  
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,  
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,  
Fuck these niggaz and peep out whitey ro,  
Somebody told? well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,  
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on,  
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on,  
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home,  
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun,  
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one)  
  
Oh, you can't trust nobody baby, you can't even trust your own mama!  
This is snoopy collins, trust no one, especially a bitch  
Or even a bitch-ass nigga, yo ha!  
  
T-r-u-s-t in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,  
The homies in the hood call me lil' bo peep,  
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,  
So snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?  
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you,  
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm goin' do,  
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home,  
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cause, or down wit' bud  
Pushin' them dubs, look here cause,  
Lemme tell you how it's goin' be  
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me  
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?  
Ask them hoes over there, ""y'all wanna fuck snoop?"" (yeah!)  
We'll take the money and the game away,  
I bet they won't say the same that day,  
But it's okay, cause I don't trip,  
Cause ""bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"",  
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja,  
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller,  
From the solar, cause this, is it,  
Can ya dig it? (i can dig it!)  
Jelly roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,  
I pull a strap out my motherfucking back, cause I know it's like dat,  
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,  
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead,  
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,  
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the reds,  
But I'm a dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,  
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,  
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',  
Rip-ridin', put mines in,  
Takin' this game to the next level,  
Trustin' no one, especially them red devils,  
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,  
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,  
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),  
And like I told you from the gettin', don't trust no one

Oh no! you did it again! put me down!

I shine brighter than the stars in the night  
And 'bout ready for a fight  
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice  
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon  
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun  
I'm torching hot and all the same  
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein  
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown  
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome  
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me  
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey  
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]  
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now?  
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow  
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step  
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck  
High profile, but my style low-pro  
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O.  
And I blow the best indo, that you know of  
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love  
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now  
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle

If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me  
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof  
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth  
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?  
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash  
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now  
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle

All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang  
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game  
He so sprung, on top of that he young  
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold  
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees  
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies  
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game  
Now they 'bout to take him out the game  
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go  
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ??

I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots

Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end  
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green  
And all my life I got advice from a superior team  
I gotta stay away from the casket  
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted

Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty  
Black female with chips, from the city?  
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends  
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends  
Good girl, why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)  
When I was a kid, growing up, I never had toys  
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)  
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up  
Shit, she'd take a nigga out  
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look  
Baby was my thing, nah, she was my low-low  
Bought my first Rolo, and then we took a photo together  
Man I hope this thing last forever  
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet  
She loving a nigga, steady buying me shit  
And don't say shit when I dip with my click  
And understand, when I'm down and out  
May need some help with some chips  
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't  
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk

Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time

On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe  
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit  
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch

Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)  
Never caught slipping, always on strap  
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby  
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy  
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college  
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge

The world just ain't the same?  
And come to find out this niggas crossing out my motherfucking name  
So what am I to do?

Everything fine  
In G-O-D we trust  
That's why y'all suckers can't touch us, touch us  
Meech, you made the beat  
And you know when we get together  
Shit, we like bread and meat  
We coming with the heat  
Close your mouth 'cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out  
And what about the cop?  
I pay them and the ones I didn't I slaved them, haha  
Will it ever stop?  
It's like asking who is it?  
Before a nigga even knock  
The game is here to stay?  
And I'm here to change the rules cause I'm a player that loves to play  
Did you thank the lord today?  
Think I did and on that note young Loc, I'm getting dose  
Why you tell the truth?

And now I know what they're saying  
When the sun begins to fade  
And we made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Father made my history  
He fought for what he thought  
Would set us somehow free  
He tought me what to say in school  
I learned off by heart  
But now that's torn in two  
And now I know what they're saying  
In the music of the parade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Born on different sides of life  
We feel the same  
And feel all of this strife  
So come to me when I'm asleep  
We'll cross the line  
And dance upon the street  
And now I know what they're saying  
When the drums begin to fade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Oh, turn around and I'll be there  
There's a scar through my heart  
But I'll bare it again  
I thought we were the human race  
But we were just another border-line-case  
And the stars reach down and tell us  
That there's always one escape  
I don't know where love has gone  
And in this trouble land  
Desperation keep us strong  
Fridays child is full of soul  
With nothing left to lose  
There's everything to go  
And now I know what they're are saying  
It's a terrible beauty we've made  
So we make our love on wasteland

Rode on his horse  
Into the darkened wood  
No one believed  
That he'd return  
They thought he'd gone for good  
As he looked down to see the lake  
He found a secret key  
The little king he couldn't wait  
And he rode off nervously  
In a stolen car  
On busy streets  
He spun the leather wheel  
He was burning oil  
In second gear  
As the tyres loudly squealed  
And the bouncers on the kerb  
Jumped right out of the way  
He smashed into a superstore  
And he didn't feel a thing  
Just a quiet night where the fun begins  
For the little king  
Once life was merry going round  
Then time began to rub  
The future looked as clear as day  
But it quickly turned to mud  
It stuck to him like glue  
What can anybody do  
For the little king  
For the little king  
Now the little king  
Is locked away  
To mix with the elite  
In the doghouse now  
He learns new tricks  
From other pedigrees  
It's small town front page news  
The fairy tale your king  
Has scratched his head looking for clues  
He found splinters there  
But one day soon the latch will swing  
For the little king

The clouds puffed up like bags of sweets

My guts were full of churning fear  
With so much bull I had to clear  
When she said stuff yourself, don't be a clown  
Paint your wagon and take yourself right out of town  
What's this long face that keeps on  
Hanging around  
  
She wouldn't say, I couldn't tell  
Was this the day I'd go to hell  
I sulked around in such a mood  
Until I found the one I'd screwed  
And then it came as clear as mud  
I was the pain that boiled the blood  
And saw the faults where there were none  
Deep in the vaults where love begun  
  
When she said stuff yourself, don't be a clown  
Paint your wagon and take yourself right out of town  
What's this long face that keeps on  
Hanging around  
Then she said get a grip and shake this mood  
Get a life and find yourself some attitude

Hanging around

A sarsparilla drink turns white teeth shades of pink  
Sunday league play in the sunshine  
I hear the whistle blow at halftime  
With chapped legs and muddy shorts  
They walk home past the tennis courts  
A pint of prawns in hand  
I hear a ragtime band  
  
On Monday  
I want the weekend to come  
On Tuesday  
I'm glad that Monday is done  
Then Wednesday  
And Thursday fly by  
Then on Friday and Saturday night  
We get happy till Sunday is through  
  
Siesta time in the living room  
Snores go in and out of tune  
After tea time we're off to the pub  
To play in the trivia club  
How long's the river Thames?  
It's where the evening ends  
In my bed I'm reading poetry  
No one knows what's come over me  
I close the book and turning out the light  
I hear the sound of Monday outside

Flames still flicker on the log  
Coffee brewing in the kitchen  
Where the door is open wide  
Glass upon a hovered carpet  
Eyes are glowing in the night  
  
It's the silence you can see  
Hearing shadows behind me  
  
All the buildings standing empty  
All the trains are standing still  
Cars are scattered by the roadside  
There's no top upon the hill  
Nails have scratched upon the outside  
Of the empty chapel door  
But i don't think that the father  
  
Wants to live there anymore  
There's no bone for you to pick  
No more wax around the wick  
  
Shot the arrow from the circle  
At the apple on the tree  
From a garden that was eden  
Strange the fruit it bears for me  
And the wind will spread the fire  
And the rain will ever fall  
If no one reads the writing  
That's been written on the wall  
  
Underneath the apple tree  
There's a ghost who waits for me  
  
The apple tree shakes its arms  
Its fruit falls  
Its fruits are tasting strange

I'm taking off and touching down  
When I get home it's much the same  
The tax returns return again  
The news is on it isn't good  
I see the trees but not the wood  
  
The road stretches out as far as I can see  
And I eat the lines ahead of me  
It's experience  
As the days unfold  
But there's nothing quite like  
The day I get home  
  
When this young man comes rolling home  
The cheese on toast is in the grill  
Memories are filed away  
I come and go, it's fun that way  
The roads of air that map the globe  
Go east and west and north and south  
I like to look and see the sights  
I stay up late and hit the heights  
  
When I return things haven't changed  
Neither have I, I like to think  
The world's an oyster on a plate

Broken by the flame of fun  
Lying back with Exodus  
In the arms of lovers trust  
  
That romantic dance of light  
From the curtain broken night  
Shadows fall on mystery  
Love has ripened here for me  
Stubbing out the cigarette  
I see the clothes beside the bed  
As the half light of the day  
Pulls the sheet up once again  
  
As the phone hangs by the cord

A drink couldn't oil my expression  
Nothing could've made me laugh  
I was worried out of my head  
I was in such a state  
What's keeping her, where has she gone  
I played the waiting game  
When you love someone  
You worry when they're late  
When you trust someone  
You know the time it takes  
To play the waiting game  
The music got louder and louder  
From the wooden floor upstairs  
I played with a handful of peanuts  
Then I saw her standing there  
My mood leapt right out of the bath  
She had got stuck in the rain  
Her coat dripped on a hanger  
Playing the waiting  
I couldn't understand her  
Playing the waiting  
Seemed like I'd wait forever

All over the floor

I was trying  
To impress the Empress with  
My wimpy tales  
Fanning her face from cigar smoke  
And sighing  
I had come close to be miles  
From her trail  
  
She was the jewel that  
Sparkled in darkness  
She was the love  
Of everyone's life  
She was the catch at  
Everyone's parties  
She was the one with a tongue  
Like a knife  
  
Her bosoms curved perfectly  
Lit by the fire  
My mind launched away  
In a sea of its own  
Her grace and her tightness  
I had to admire  
Through a whore's breath of stories  
I happily told  
  
Trespassing my hand  
Fell into hot water  
She shot like a bullet  
Right out of her chair  
She led me away and I  
Was then slaughtered  
By the warmth of her body  
And her love and care  
  
Her tongue cut away  
And the wounds slowly opened  
I lay on the sails of the  
Ship of romance  
Drunk as I could be and  
Broker than broken and  
The head of my hunt  
Was there in my hands

With some or other passions

""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""

With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly

We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing

And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday

I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption  
I'm really up the junction

The moon as white and virgin  
And she was on the turning

They really trooped the colors  
When walking with each other  
And all her mates would giggle  
As ladylike she'd wiggle  
All along the high street  
They'd splash out on an ice cream  
He'd sometimes really treat her  
But he'd done his mother's meter  
  
Well he went off to borstal  
He said that he was forced to  
Rob the flats of hi fi's

And she would cry  
Each morning she got sicker  
Her mother sometimes hit her  
If she'd have known the story  
She would have been so sorry  
  
He received a letter and admitted it  
There was nothing else to do but get rid of it  
Lonely in his dormitory  
He'd sit and stare  
If this is for real  
And is it really fair  
  
Summer came so they went  
Down to the coast in his tent  
She cooked upon his primus  
And sampled local cider  
She told him in his rucksack  
I think i want that chance back  
To be perhaps the one who  
Will forever love you

From the ashes of the gay,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming through a crack in the wall,  
On a visionary flood of alcohol,  
From the staggering account  
Of the Sermon on the Mount  
Which I don't pretend to understand at all.  
It's coming from the silence  
On the dock of the bay,  
From the brave, the bold, the battered  
Heart of Chevrolet:  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the sorrow in the street,  
The holy places where the races meet,  
From the homicidal bitching  
That goes down in every kitchen  
To determine who will serve and who will eat.  
From the wells of disappointment  
Where the women kneel to pray  
For the grace of God in the desert here  
And the desert far away,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
Sail on, sail on  
Oh mighty Ship of State!  
To the Shores of Need  
Past the Reefs of Greed  
Through the Squalls of Hate  
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.  
  
It's coming to America first,  
The cradle of the best and of the worst.  
It's here they got the range  
And the machinery for change  
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.  
It's here the family's broken  
And it's here the lonely say  
That the heart has got to open  
In a fundamental way,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the women and the men.  
Oh baby, we'll be making love again.

She said, it's getting lonely here

She met me off the flight, a million dollars in her long red gown  
With a man in a black hat just to drive us back to town  
Now the faces all look the same  
And all the places have the same old names  
But in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
Yes, in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home

Yes, in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
  
It took another year before I started getting itchy toes  
And then I had to leave, but that's the way the story goes

I'd never live to see another day

Status Quo,Mysteries From The Ball,/s/status+quo/mysteries+from+the+ball_20268455.html,"Running along on the side of the waterfront  
Someone is looking at me  
Trying to turn me around like an enemy  
Trying to turn me away  
Holding on tight to the side of reality  
Is it a vision I see?  
Leading me on to the pictures that I want to see  
  
Fantasy lovingly restored to me  
Magic moments from the past, magic moments  
Mysteries from the ball  
  
Back at the table it's getting too hot for me  
Ice is afloat on my wings  
Caught in the thunder and lightning of everything  
Caught in the everyday things  
Moving on up is the feeling inside of me  
Losing my grip on the floor  
Holding on tight to the hand that has given me more  
  
Fantasy lovingly restored to me  
Magic moments from the past, magic moments  
Mysteries from the ball  
  
Running along on the side of the waterfront

Holding our breath and hoping it never will end  
It's been a long, long haul  
We would be ducking and diving, a rise then a fall  
Pretending the ups and the downs didn't matter at all  
And we got it almost right  
Well, there were hundreds and hundreds of mumbling miles  
Always a personal reason to cop or to smile  
Now there's a green light  
We came and we went, we went then we came  
Slowly but surely we learnt that it wasn't a game  
But it was good clean fun  
We were just second hand cars along with the rest  
Holding our own and hanging on in with the best  
Nothing comes easy  
Drinking and thinking what we'd rather do  
Nothing of any real interest is coming on through  
Maybe we're all right now  
But in the end does it matter, matter at all?  
Scratching a living and having one hell of a ball  
Nothing comes easy

With blood and everything  
Some punky laughter from the kitchen  
And then, a nice relaxing hand of solitaire

You can choose the music  
I'll set up my gear  
Later on we'll chill and watch the fireworks from here  
  
How can you knock this mighty spite lock  
Check out the work itself  
A mix of elegance and function  
That's right, a tweak or two and then she's out of here

Set on this peaceful shore  
You think you've heard this one before  
  
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past  
Still I remain tied to the mast  
Could it be that I have found my home at last  
Home at last

She keeps me safe and warm  
It's just the calm before the storm  
Call in my reservation  
So long hey thanks my friend

Your lashing turn  
It hurts my soul  
I start to think  
And I lose control  
I'm not moving like I know I should  
Or feeling like I'd like to feel  
And I spend my days just fooling around

Every day is the Fourth of July  
And I'm nothing but an April Fool  
Well I spend my days just cruising around

Honey when you run me down  
Oh darling don't you run me down  
I'm half a man  
With half a heart  
I hear you laughing  
And I fall apart  
I'd like to put it on the table  
But I'm lost before I even start  
You do me wrong and it's bringing me down  
My idle ways are the talk of the town  
You make me feel like a do-nothing-clown  
I can't function

A doctor friend uptown  
And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down

About the good and the bad and the poor

And I've been travelin' through space  
Since the moment I first realized  
What all you fast talkin' cats would do if you could  
You know, I'm ready for the final surprise  
There ain't no way around it  
Ain't nothing to say  
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside  
All the prayers and surveyors  
Keep the whole place uptight  
While it keeps on gettin' darker outside

When you get fooled by smiling faces but

A chance to check out the new

Come on home  
Oh yes so I won't  
Be all alone

You'll be home soon

Yo, it ain't no joke  
We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl

Ut oh, 11 o'clock pm and here's the news  
Another fatality caused by a family feud  
Charged, tried, sentenced by the jury of a brother's gun  
Made sister's fiancee's wedding never to be sung  
He didn't like the way he treated the girl  
So the boy played God, pow, he ended his world  
  
He made a plea for temporary insanity  
But left his sister insane permanently  
This ain't new, this stuff happens everyday  
Somebody doesn't like someone so they blow them away  
Too fast for reason, too quick to negotiate  
  
Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late  
Jealousy for power, greed for possession  
Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression  
Speaking of which I'm truly not impressed  
So if seeing is believin'-I don't want to see the mess  
  
Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser  
As if for negativity we got the vapors  
Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor  
Cause we are too busy at each other's throat  
  
Each other's throat  
Each other's throat  
Yo, it ain't no joke  
We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl

Stevie Wonder,Front Line,/s/stevie+wonder/front+line_20200006.html,"I am a veteran of the war  
I up and joined the army back in nineteen sixty-four  
At sixteen, I just had to be a man at any cost  
I volunteered for Vietnam, where I got my leg shot off  
I recall a quote form a movie that said: ""who's more a man  
Than a man with a reason that's worth dyin' for?""  
  
[Chorus]  
They had me standing on the front line  
They had me standing on the front line  
They had me standing on the front line  
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead  
  
They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill  
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill  
They put a gun in my hand and said ""shoot until he's dead.""  
But it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head  
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life  
But then put in the jungle where life has no price, no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back in the world, the paper reads today  
Another war is in the brewing  
But what about the lives of yesterday  
And the many happy families that have been ruined?  
My niece is a hooker, and my nephew's a junkie too  
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do  
They laugh and say quit braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in  
But my mind is so brain-washed I'd probably go back and do it again  
I walk the neighborhood, parading my purple heart  
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

Would you believe I do?

Hold on to your dream  
Cause they're always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
'till the day that life is said and done  
This world is filled peaks and valleys  
With rivers we think we can't cross  
To busy keeping sorrows telling  
You say you're at you're in  
You say you never win  
But then a light comes on in your mind  
Till you  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause they're always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
Until the day that life is said and done  
If you wanna hold on to something  
You better hold on to your dreams  
If you want to hold on to something  
You've gotta hold to your love  
To your love  
So if they try to burst your bubble  
It's cons they haven't done 'em all  
And when you feel you are in trouble  
Hold your head up high and feel your heart inside  
And know that you are never alone  
Just as long as you  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause they're always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
'till the day that life is said and done  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause they're always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a mother to her child  
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you  
Hold on to your dream  
And do your best to always wear a smile  
Hold on to your dream

No wedding Saturday within the month of June

Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say how much I care  
I just called to say I love you

No warm July  
No harvest moon to light one tender August night  
  
No autumn breeze  
No falling leaves  
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies  
  
No Libra sun  
No Halloween  
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring  
But what it is, though old so new  
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say how much I care, I do  
I just called to say I love you

Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Would not get a thing

Joy the day would bring  
Sneaking out the back door  
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine  
Greeted at the back door  
With boy thought I told you not to go outside  
Tryin' your best to bring the  
Water to your eyes  
Thinkin' it might stop her  
From woopin' your behind

'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl

Anything you want in this whole wide world  
Mama gives you money for Sunday school  
You trade yours for candy after church is through  
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)  
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall

You can't say the words and not move your lips  
You can't be confused and still say you understand

You can't be a click but in danger split  
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand  
You can't say you do but then show you don't  
You can't say you will and make sure you won't  
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do  
  
You can't give up all and then take back all you give  
You can't live to die but you can die to live

'Cause much to your dismay, you've been taken far away  
To a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man  
  
Where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty  
And a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame  
But at the very instant all was through, lady lucks appears, says ""love can
do""  
And changed you like a Christian who's been born again  
  
I'm new, new like the fresh morning dew  
New like a work of art that's finally through  
I'm new, new like a first flight of a dove  
So safe and secure with your love, I'm new  
  
Love took a long time coming to me  
But I've gotta say  
I owe my thanks to him for sending you my way, hey  
  
'Cause I'm new, new like the first winter snow  
Like the start of forever, with infinity to go  
I'm new, new like the birth of the sun  
Forever young I will be  
  
'Cause with your love, I'm new  
New like from a restful night of sleep  
New like a starving man that's had food to eat  
  
I'm new, nothing compares nor can compete  
Sharing with you the sweetness of your love, I'm new

How can I make you love me  
A little more than you loved him?  
Oh baby  
  
Jimmy was your sweetie pie  
Your precious one  
And I knew you used to love  
The very ground he walked upon  
One day, Jim's papa told him  
Things were looking down  
And they packed up everything  
They owned and left this little old town  
Each tear I dried for you,  
The closer our lives grew,  
I fell in love it's true  
And you say you love me, too  
  
But, baby I'm wondering  
Little girl, I'm wondering  
How can I make you love me  
A little more than you loved him?  
Oh baby I'm wondering,  
Little girl, I'm wondering  
How can I make you love me  
A little more than you loved Jim?  
  
The day you see his face again  
Or hear his voice  
I don't want to be a loser  
If you have to make a choice  
Like a puppet to a string  
To you, girl, I'm attached  
And I know I'd be in trouble  
If he came and took you back  
I feel so insecure  
In my mind, I can picture  
Losing you for sure  
And the pain I can't endure

I can't stop loving you, baby,  
I can't stop loving you , no  
I can't stop loving you, baby

In my mind, I  
Can picture  
Losing you for sure  
And the pain I can't endure

Really, really worried  
I want to make you happy  
Really truly happy

As if they've never seen a heart in love  
And though I see them I don't care  
'cause, I'm too busy thinking bout our love  
Thinking about that each and every morning  
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes  
And though it seems I'm hooked on this fixation  
I will not stop my daydreaming  
Until my nights are true with you  
Ooh baby, my love is on fire  
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild  
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire  
I want to feel your love  
I need to feel your love mixed with mine  
Listen at me call your name  
As if you're witness to my every word  
And though it seems sometimes insane  
Something within me tells me they'll be heard  
So I wait so patiently the moment  
When my love fantasies will come to life  
And all I need from you is confirmation  
Then I'll be living truth, those moments  
That I long with you

Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet  
Yet what happened so tragically  
Really makes for no sense at all  
Suddenly two guys confronted me  
Saying I was on the wrong turf, angrily  
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray  
I started to turn to go back  
They up and blew me away  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you, where ever you are (repeat)  
  
Though my life they've taken  
They can't take what we've shared  
Spread the love I've given  
And I'll be there  
  
I was out playing with my friends  
You know, doing those silly things kids do at ten  
But the crossfire I was caught in  
Should not have been in the first place  
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech  
Someone yelled ""nobody gets away with dissin' me""  
Across the street a man pulled his nine  
Everybody started to run  
A shower of bullets rang out  
Mistakenly my life was done, oh  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you, where ever you are (repeat)  
  
Though my life they've taken  
They can't take what we've shared  
Spread the love I've given  
I'll be there  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you, where ever you are (repeat)  
  
When you're joyful  
When you're lonely  
When you're happy  
When tears are streamin' right down your face  
In the morning  
In the noon time  
In the evening  
In the wee wee hours of the nighttime hour  
In the summer  
In the springtime  
In the autumn  
In the cold long winter, winter nights  
My love is with you  
My love is with you my best friend  
My love is with you my brother  
My love is with you my sister  
My love is with you my mother  
My love is with you my father

One rainy April Monday  
Smiling soft and warm as on  
A clear December Sunday  
Wearing taffeta and lace  
That matched her braided hair  
With their coraled beads that sang to me  
  
She said 'hi' and asked me why  
Was I looking with sorrow  
When there were much brighter days  
In store for me tomorrow  
  
I looked up at her and smiled  
And said, why I don't know  
But would she agree, to stay with me  
And she said  
Never in your sun, she said  
Never in your sun, then she said  
I will only come  
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain  
  
So if you are at lover's park  
And someone looks with sorrow  
Ask them why are they so sad  
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow  
They'll reply they don't know why  
And ask you please to stay  
'Til the end of time, and when they're fine  
  
Be kind and say  
Never in your sun, just tell them  
Never in your sun, then say

A voice that was heard throughout the world,  
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star,  
Tonight he'll light the world!""

As when two stormy clouds collide

To our lives

At living a second time

Go knock on her door

Than just an ordinary pain in your heart

But she says goodbye  
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry  
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Can she take with her the pain she brought you back

Stevie Wonder,Positivity,/s/stevie+wonder/positivity_20535344.html,"Some people ask me why always on the bright side  
When there's so much going on down the other side  
It's like I live in a bubble with no trouble  
And problems don't exist  
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all  
It goes way back to the time when I was very small  
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say  
You can always look at the negative  
But you should always live in the positive  
So I try everyday to live that way  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Some people live in what was and what they could have been  
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can  
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way  
The attitude is ""that I can't do nothing 'bout""  
And very happy with just breathing in and out  
The ones that when you say ""lets go make a difference""  
They'll say ""naw that's OK""  
So I don't waste time on the trip side  
'Cause I do know the real on the flipside  
And I'm crystal clear everyday that's why I say, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I see the morning  
And the sun is smiling down upon me  
I joy in the blessing  
That still the ground is not above me  
And for the people  
That I can truly say do love me, I feel  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be  
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be  
Some ask me why I'm such an optimist  
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist  
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view  
Well I use to have a friend named Minnie Riperton  
Who use to always say when she was living  
""Like fine wine I like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty""  
I'm saying sometimes life can't be rough  
But never to the point of me saying I've had enough  
Long as my heart beats I ain't giving up  
That's why I say everyday  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When people ask me as an African American  
What do I see for tomorrow in the human plan?  
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?  
I say unity is only as big as our vision  
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon  
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society  
That stands in our way  
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call  
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all  
'Cause the world vision I see is the one-we for everybody  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I see the morning  
And the sun is smiling down upon me  
Just joy in the blessing  
That still the ground is not above me  
And for the people  
That you can truly say do love you, do feel  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be  
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life means to me  
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be  
Positivity, 'cause that's the energy the world needs  
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be

And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your  
Power to vote  
Knowin' some would like to turn back the hands of time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I'm hooked on a habit knowin' damn well it could  
Cost me my life  
Yet I keep doin' what I should do without  
Shame on me  
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half  
Just gives you abuse  
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out  
Shame on you  
If we're jammin' the music and somebody's got the  
Audacity  
To say that they can jam it better than us  
Shame on them  
And should there be just a handful that believe that  
We are totally free  
And there's no need to fight for equality  
  
[Chorus]

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm December our hearts will see  
A world where men are free  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime  
  
Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man  
No hungry children, no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world where people care  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears  
One shinning moment my heart ran away  
From our world today  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime  
  
Someday at Christmas man will not fail  
Take hope because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime  
Someday at Christmastime

To know that heavens round  
Oh what gladness in my heart

Was the best you ever had

To a tower of souls  
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,

I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,  
A million names but only one truth to face  
A million roads, a million fears  
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty  
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,  
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time  
But if there was a single truth, a single light  
A single thought, a singular touch of grace  
Then following this single point, this single flame,  
This single haunted memory of your face  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
I may be numberless, I may be innocent  
I may know many things, I may be ignorant  
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands  
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands  
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times  
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes  
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief  
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief  
I still love you  
I still want you  
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves  
Like galaxies in my head  
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves  
Eternities still unsaid

And all that's left is a quarter moon of light  
He climbs up through the darkness  
No weapon but his surprise  
The greatest thief in the high Sahara  
Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies  
All your money, your pretty necklace  
This is my work on such a night  
There's a storm coming over the mountain  
I'll be gone long before the morning  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You find that I've taken nothing, that  
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye  
He was as gentle as the night wind  
As no lover had been before  
And the rings she wore for her bride groom  
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor  
Take me with you, take me with you  
Before my lonely life is set  
I've been promised to another  
To a man I've never even met  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that  
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye  
After the thunder's spoken, and  
After the lightning bolt's been hurled  
After the dream is broken, there'll  
Still be love in the world  
She said take me to another life  
Take me for a pirate's wife  
Take me where the wind blows  
Take me where the red wine flows  
Take me to the danger  
Take me to the life of crime  
Take me to the stars  
Take me to the moon while we still have time  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that

Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play.  
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light,  
Two priests on the ferry.  
October geese on a cold winter's night.  
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.  
  
Two priests came 'round our house tonight,  
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite.  
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows.  
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows.  
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.  
  
If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man.  
I'd bury him at sea.  
  
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth.  
Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of the needle.  
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing.  
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?  
All this time the river flowed endlessly like a silent tear.  
  
All this time the river flowed.  
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?  
Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah.  
  
Teachers told the Romans built this place.  
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town.  
They lived and they died.  
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound.  
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left  
Were the stones the workmen found.  
All this time the river flowed in the falling light of a Northern sun.  
If I had my way, take a boat from the river.  
Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one.  
One by one. One by one by one. One by one.

The wind blows cold when you reach the top  
Feels like somebody's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe  
Got a plastic Jesus, a cordless telephone for every corner of my room  
Got everybody but you tellin' me what to do  
  
Well I've been down so long  
It can't be that much longer still  
And I've been down for so long  
That the end must be drawing near  
  
I looked to everybody but me  
To answer my prayers  
Until I found an angel in the bathroom  
Who said she didn't see anybody who was saving anywhere  
And the blind man said, ""Simple... like flipping a coin -  
Don't matter what side it lands on  
So long as it's somebody else's dime""  
Cause if you're the top of the bottom  
It all feels the same  
We live out of fear if we're too rich or we're too poor  
Guess all I can do is muster up some change  
And a little bit of faith  
And take some dignity when I walk through this door  
  
Gonna take a trip  
Catch a train  
Got a ticket in my hand  
And then a fat man takes my money  
And like cattle we all stand  
I'm just a faceless body lost in this vast and worthless sea  
In a thousand people I do not know  
But really they are no different from me  
They all have passion  
They all have fear  
They all have intense confusion  
And no sweet moments that are clear  
They all have aspirations  
High hopes and dreams  
And are really that alone like me  
  
We've been down so long  
It can't be that much longer still  
We've been down so long  
That the end must be...

The same old trial  
The same old questions asked  
The same denial  
The shadows closing round

The fire's embers

His icy fingers creep  
Into these bones of mine  
These memories never sleep  
And all these differences  
A cloak I borrowed  
We kept our distances  
Why should it follow that  
I must have loved you?  
What is the force that binds the stars?  
I wore this mask to hide my scars  
What is the power that pulls the tide?  
Never could find a place to hide  
What moves the earth around the sun?  
What could I do but run and run and run?  
Afraid to love, afraid to fail  
A mast without a sail  
The moon's a fingernail  
And slowly sinking  
Another day begins  
And now I'm thinking  
That this is indifference  
Was my invention  
When everything I did  
Sought your attention  
You were my compass star  
You were my measure  
You were a pirate's map

You'll only make me cry  
If there's one guy, just one guy  
Who'd lay down his life for you and die  
  
It's hard to say it  
I hate to say it, but it's probably me  
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense  
There's only one voice that comes to your defense  
The jury's out and your eyes search the room  
And one friendly face is all you need to see  
If there's one guy, just one guy  
Who'd lay down his life for you and die  
  
It's hard to say it  
I hate to say it, but it's probably me  
I hate to say it  
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

Sting,Lullaby To An Anxious Child,/s/sting/lullaby+to+an+anxious+child_20237442.html,"Hush child,  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child,  
Let me soothe the shining tears that gather in your eyes  
  
Hush child,  
I won't leave I'll stay with you to cross this Bridge of Sighs  
Hush child,  
I can help the look of accusation in your eyes  
In your eyes  
  
The world is broken and now  
All in sorrow  
Wise men hang their heads  
  
Hush child,  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child,  
All the strength I'll need to find, I'll find inside your eyes  
In your eyes

Sting,Mad About You,/s/sting/mad+about+you_20132092.html,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And from the dark secluded valleys  
I heard the ancient songs of sadness  
But every step I thought of you  
Every footstep only you  
And every star a grain of sand  
The leavings of a dried up ocean  
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?  
They say a city in the desert lies  
The vanity of an ancient king  
But the city lies in broken pieces  
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing  
These are the works of man  
This is the sum of our ambition  
It would make a prison of my life  
If you became another's wife  
With every prison blown to dust  
My enemies walk free  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And I have never in my life  
Felt more alone than I do now  
Although I claim dominions over all I see  
It means nothing to me  
There are no victories  
In all our histories, without love  
A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
And though you hold the keys to ruin  
Of everything I see  
With every prison blown to dust,  
My enemies walk free  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you

Sting,Moon Over Bourbon Street,/s/sting/moon+over+bourbon+street_20132085.html,"There's a moon over bourbon street tonight  
I see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamplight  
I've no choice but to follow that call  
The bright lights the people and the moon and all  
I pray everyday to be strong  
For I know what I do must be wrong  
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet  
While there's a moon over bourbon street  
  
It was many years ago that I became what I am  
I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb  
Now I can never show my face at noon  
And you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon  
The brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast  
I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest  
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet  
While there's a moon over bourbon street  
  
She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans  
She's innocent and young from a family of means  
I have stood many times outside her window at night  
To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight  
How could I be this way when I pray to god above  
I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love  
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet  
While there's a moon over bourbon street

Sting,Moonlight,/s/sting/moonlight_20259214.html,"In the moonlight  
When the shadows play  
When the thought of what could happen  
Takes your breath away  
Sighs and whispers  
Quiet laughter in the air  
Unspoken invitations everywhere  
  
In the moonlight  
All the words you say  
Make it relatively easy  
To be swept away  
In the half light  
Can we trust the way we feel  
Can we be sure that anything is real?  
  
Stars keep secrets as they wander indiscreetly  
While the echoes of a song go drifting by  
We must be careful not to lose our way completely  
Or the magic that we seek here  
We can't be sure will be here  
  
In the morning  
With the moon away  
And if in each other's arms  
Is where we're meant to stay  
  
In the love light  
When our eyes have grown accustomed to the daylight  
We'll see what waits for us to share  
For all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight  
Will be there

Sting,My Funny Friend And Me,/s/sting/my+funny+friend+me_20267278.html,"In the quiet time of evening  
When the stars assume their patterns  
And the day has made his journey  
And we wondered just what happened  
To the life we knew before the world changed  
When not a thing I held was true  
But you were kind to me and you reminded me  
That the world is not my playground  
There are other things that matter  
And when a simple needs protecting  
My illusions all would shatter  
But you stayed in my corner  
The only world I knew was upside down  
And now the world and me, I know you carry me  
You see the patterns in the big sky  
Those constellations look like you and I  
Just like the patterns in the big sky  
We could be lost, we could refuse to try  
But we made it through in the dark night  
Would those lucky guys turn out to be  
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me  
I'm not as clever as I thought I was  
I'm not the boy I used to be because  
You showed me something different  
You showed me something pure  
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure  
But you stayed and you called my name  
When others would have walked out on a lousy game  
And you could've made it through  
But your funny friend and you.  
You see the patterns in the big sky  
Those constellations look like you and I  
That tiny planet in a bigger guy  
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry  
Just like the patterns in the big sky  
We'll be together ?til the end this time  
Don't know the answer or the reason why  
We'll stick together till the day we die  
If I had to do this all a second time  
I won't complain or make a fuss  
When the angels sing that that unlikely blend  
Are those two funny friends, that's us

Sting,Narration,/s/sting/narration_20283723.html,"One. Exterior.  
Cathedral. Daylight. Establishing it's beauty in elevation, stain  
Glass and stone carvings. From its huge doors suddenly comes a  
Flow of white cloud choir boys. Angelic, white surplussed, all  
Bobbing in a disciplined stream. But then, suddenly in their  
Midst, startling, ridiculous, incongruous is Martin a young man  
In an ill fitting rain coat. As the boys proceed in their orderly  
Way, Martin is left alone. Peculiar, disturbing. Which one...  
Which one will it be?  
  
Two. Interior. An office near the Cathedral. Daylight. A view of  
The Cathedral through the window. Alone, in this Dickensian  
Office above the small printing presses, sits Mr. Bates, middle  
Aged, meticulous, writing with a gold barreled fountain pen. He's  
Finishing a little verse beneath a picture of an angel:  
  
Although we all must sometimes stumble  
As we journey through this life,  
I've never heard you moan or grumble,  
The perfect mother and wife.  
Bates places the sheet of paper on top of a pile of similar  
Sheets, his face heavy with contempt. He stares into the middle  
Distance. A framed photograph of a lively, attractive young  
Woman, Patty, his daughter, is in front of him, on his expanse of  
Desk. He glances at it. He caps his fountain pen, neatly puts the  
Sheet into the pending tray, neatly lines up his blotter, his  
Desk aids, and satisfied, rises to join the homeward throng.  
  
Three. Exterior. Cathedral precincts. Fading daylight. A few  
People bobbing along with the anomalous, near vacant, tired  
Expression of home-goers. Which one... which one will it be?
