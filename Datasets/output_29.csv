Clash,Justice Tonight-Kick It Over,/c/clash/justice+tonight+kick+it+over_20031912.html,"Stay around don't play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Runnin' and a hiding tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you through Armageddon time  
It's Armageddon  
It's not Christmas time  
  
A lot of people  
A lot of people use a calculator  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
A lot of people sittin' down by the light  
  
The battle is gettin' hotter  
Armageddon time  
Armageddon  
  
Remember to kick it over  
Armageddon time  
  
A lot of people ain't got no supper tonight  
A lot of people got to stand out back

Clash,King Of The Road,/c/clash/king+of+the+road_20514052.html,"Trailers for sale of rent  
Rooms to let 50 cents, now  
No phone, no pool, no pets  
I ain't got no cigarettes  
  
Now two hours of shoving broom  
But an eight-by-twelve four bed room  
I'm a man of means by no means  
King of the road  
  
Third box-car on the midnight tube  
Destination Hangar Lane  
Old worn out suit and shoes  
I don't pay no union dues  
  
I smoke old stogies I have found  
Short but not too big around  
Man of means by no means  
King a' the road

Clash,Kingston Advice,/c/clash/kingston+advice_20031858.html,"In these days you can get no rice  
No razor blades but you can get knife  
In these days see the people run  
They have no food but the boy have gun  
In these days they don't throw the stone  
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone  
In these days to be an oddity  
Be hunted down like a scarcity  
  
In these days don't beg for life  
Want to take Kingston advice?  
Oh please don't beg for your life  
  
In these days the beat is militant  
Must be a clash there's no alternative  
In these days nations are militant  
We have slavery under government  
In these days in the firmament  
I look for signs that are permanent  
  
In these days with no love to give  
The world will turn with no one left to live  
  
In these days I don't know what to do  
The more I see the more I'm destitute  
In these days I don't know what to sing  
The more I know the less my tune can swing  
  
In these days you can get no rice  
No razor blades but you can get knife

Policeman or aristocrat

In some quarters that this is not enough!  
Well...  
  
Get off the streets  
Get off the streets  
Run  
You don't have a home to go to  
Smush

You have the right to remain silent  
You are warned that anything you say  
Can and will be taken down  
And used as evidence against you

Jumping from the windows-filled with indecision  
  
I get good advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isn't any  
So freeze, man, freeze  
  
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power  
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour  
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot  
You won't need a launderette, you can send them to the vet!

Strolling down the Broadway in the rain  
Neon light sign says it  
I read it in the paper-they're crazy!  
Suit your life, maybe so  
In the White House-I know  
All Over Berlin (they've been doing it for years)  
And in Manhattan!  
  
Coming through the door is a snub nose forty four  
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor  
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs  
And your tongue feels like a fish  
You're leaping from the windows-saying don't  
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh!

Darkness comes to settle the debt  
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect  
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest  
  
They're waiting for the sun to set  
  
The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot  
A great meeting of rhythm and face  
A humming of values and a children's place  
But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse  
To shut off the ganja and control the juice

I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air  
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires,  
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames,  
And the rebels were waltzing on air.  
  
I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz  
That was written to be danced on the battlefield  
I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl  
A voice that called ""Stand till we fall  
We stand till all the boys fall.""  
  
As we danced came the news that the war was not won  
5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun  
Through the heart of the camp  
Swept the news from the front  
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food  
We knew the war could not be won.  
  
So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun  
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one  
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun  
The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing.  
The song was an old rebel one.  
  
As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field  
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees  
I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise  
A voice began to call, stand till you fall  
The tune was an old rebel one.

My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue  
Alone in my sorrow I heard a voice cry,  
A voice in the wilderness  
A voice from the sky.  
  
Have faith in your darling  
The voice seemed to say  
Be true to her memory  
She'll come back one day.  
And though there was no one  
Nobody to see,  
The voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me  
  
We had a quarrel,  
I was unkind  
Why did you leave me  
Love made me blind  
  
My darling forgive me  
I am for your touch  
Have pity come back now  
I need you so much  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it  
That voice from above  
The voice in the wilderness  
The voice of true love  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it

She asked me what I'm thinking, and I said, ""I'm not sure,  
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl.""  
Then she leaned over... and gave me...  
Butterfly kisses, with her mama there.  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  
""Walk me down the aisle daddy, its just about time.""  
""Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?"" ""Daddy don't cry.""  
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.  
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses.  
I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is.  
I know I've gotta let her go, but Ill always remember.  
Every hug in the morning, and butterfly kisses...

The two of us  
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed

For your love  
Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine  
If you're superstitious I'm gonna try to  
Hold it down

Seen each move you've made  
Contaminate, degrade

Who's this infantile clown?

Knocking down  
Stamp your tiny foot

Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release

Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late  
  
May this imbecile  
Cause your heart to feel joy  
You did after all  
Choose the toy  
Do you now suppose  
I'll leave with no reply?  
Basic laws apply  
An eye demands an eye

Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release

Just a fool's escapade, escapade  
I never cared much about the future  
Yesterday was always there  
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise  
It just isn't fair, isn't fair  
Any plan, any calculation  
Any plot or device at all  
Runs into another's dream  
Runs into a wall

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From god our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of god by name  
  
""Fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""Let nothing you afright  
This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might""  
  
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed babe to find  
  
But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay  
They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface  
  
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign  
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again  
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--  
That God send you a happy New Year, happy New Year  
And God send you a happy New Year

After sobbin' and sighin'  
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
  
I need your arms to hold me tight  
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
  
I wake up crying  
After tossin' and turnin'  
And a-yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby please come back to me  
Save me from this mesery  
Oh baby won'tcha save me from this mesery  
Please baby won'tcha save me from this mesery

A man and wife sleep in bed she hears a noise  
And turns her head he's gone

Two men walking up a hill one disappears and  
  
One's left standing still

How still we see thee lie,  
Above the deep and dreamless sleep,  
The silent stars go by.  
Yet in the dark streets shineth,  
The everlasting light,  
The hopes and fears of all the years,  
Are met in thee tonight.  
How silently, how silently,  
The wondrous gift is given.  
So God imparts to human hearts,  
The blessings of His heaven.  
We hear the Christmas angels.  
The great glad tidings tell,  
O come to us, abide with us,  
The Lord Emmanuel.  
No ear may hear His coming.  
But in this world of sin,  
Where meek souls will receive Him still,  
The dear Christ enters in.

Could you love me  
Give me a simple clue  
Anything will do  
So long as I know  
What's in me is in you  
Could you love me  
I've got so much of care to give away  
There's only one thing I wanna hear you say  
I love you...  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt I'm in love  
I know it's all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same

The church is bright with candlelight  
And waiting Evensong, (2x)  
A single bell with plaintive strokes  
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks  
The leafless lanes along. (2x)  
  
It calls the choirboys from their tea  
And villagers, the two or three,  
Damp down the kitchen fire (2x)  
Let out the cat, and up the lane  
Go paddling through the gentle rain  
Of misty Oxfordshire (2x)  
  
On country morning sharp and clear  
The penitent in faith draw near  
And kneeling here below (2x)  
Partake the heavenly banquet spread  
Of sacramental Wine and Bread  
And Jesus' presence know (2x)  
  
And must that plaintive bell in vain  
Plead loud along the dripping lane?  
And must the building fall? (2x)  
Not while we love the church and live  
And of our charity will give  
Our much, our more, our all (2x)

That you never loved me anyway  
That the things we had done were only in fun  
Funny but I'm not laughing.  
  
Then I turned away so my eyes couldn't see  
His arms were around you where mine used to be.

Standing there on the street

The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame, what a sight  
A good love died tonight.  
  
To him it's just and ending  
But to her the pain's beginning to start  
For him it's just a walk away  
But for her it's a breaking heart  
One goodbye and lots of tears  
Are all she has left to show  
For those seven years  
That just walked out the door  
A lot of dreams lost their lives when  
A good love died tonight.  
  
They were headed for forever  
When the hope that they were riding left the track  
All the pleading and believing in the world  
Won't bring the feeling back  
You can throw away love's golden pen  
'Cause that's all she wrote  
The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame, what a sight  
A good love died tonight.

My arms are around you, my dream begins  
The only thing that's different than any other night  
Here we are together, my dream by my side.  
  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of now is complete  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream.  
  
I know now that I've been dreamin'  
I finally saw the light  
With my arms wide open  
I found the love that's right.  
  
You don't have to wake me  
For me to know it's real  
The love that I have dreamed of  
I can touch and feel.  
  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of, now is complete

Arms that reach to hold me tenderly  
And love that always satisfies completely

I who have everything am nothing without her  
Somehow she knows I need her desperately

How can anything so real become a dream

And it slips my mind what I'm supposed to say?  
We're getting older and older, and older  
And always a little further out of the way  
You look into her eyes and it's more than your heart will allow  
In August and Everything After, you get a little less than you expected,
somehow...  
  
I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun began to rise  
I lay down on the lawn of the cathedral  
Right down with the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky  
And I'm just one of these late model children waiting for the king  
Yeah, but there ain't no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco  
It's just me, and I'm playing this rock and roll thing  
And She wants to be just like me  
And I want every damn thing I can see.  
One day you're Daddy's little angel,  
The next day you're everything he wanted you to be  
They dress you up in white satin  
And they give you your very own pair of wings  
In August and Everything After, I'm after everything.  
  
I said and la la la la...  
  
Well now I got my reservations and I got my seven million-dollar home  
And I got, I got the number of some girl in New York City  
Who's always wide awake so I never have to spend the night alone  
I got this nasty little habit of peeking down the shirts  
Of all the little girls as they pass me by  
And I wonder if it all catches up to me  
Do you think they'll take me down?  
Do you think I'm gonna cry?  
Well, I've already got your disease,  
So take your fucking filthy hands off of me  
Well I hope you weren't expecting me to be crucified,  
The best that they can do is just to hang me from the nearest tree  
  
It's midnight in san francisco,  
and I am waiting here for jesus on my knees  
in august and everything after  
I want somebody else to bleed for me  
I said la la la la... Na na....  
  
Well I came down from north dakota  
'cause I had confidence in the military mind  
and now, everyone I know is turning show girl  
and is dancing with their shirt off in some las vegas hotel line  
so I'm going to new york city 'cause it gotta little sleazy here for me  
when I find myself alone I know I'm never going home  
I make the changes the changes that I need  
but I no longer know how to pray  
and I'm living in A dog town and it's A dalmation parade  
I change my spots, over and over  
but they never seem to fade away  
now I am the last remaining indian  
looking for the place where the buffalo roam  
in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming home  
I said in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming
home  
I said na na... La la...

To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear

Touching the souls of all the lonely  
Carefree boys and girls

Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear

How can I show, you, show me a way

She let out this morning  
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky  
Left me without warning  
Sooner than the dogs could bark  
And faster than the sun rose  
Down to the banks in an old mule car  
She took a flatboat across the shallow  
Chorus:  
Left me in my tears to drown  
She left a baby daughter  
Now the water's wide and deep and brown  
She's crossing muddy waters  
Tobacco standing in the fields  
Be rotten come November  
And a bitter heart will not reveal  
A spring that love remembers  
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens  
We broke the bread and drank the wine  
From a jug that she'd been saving  
Repeat chorus  
Baby's crying and the daylight's gone  
That big oak tree is groaning  
In rush of wind and river of song  
I can hear my sweetheart moaning  
Crying for her baby child  
Or crying for her husband  
Crying for that river's wild  
To take her from her loved ones

Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me,  
I'm not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
I've just begun  
To see my way clear  
And it's plain,  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain,  
Just a tear and that's all.  
  
What does she want me to do?  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that it's true  
Then on she goes  
To say I don't care,  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.  
  
She'd like to think that I'm cruel,  
But she knows that's a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me.  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Eventhough  
I can't change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That she'd understand  
  
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain?  
Can't she see that she grieves  
Just because she's been blindly deceived  
By her shame?  
  
Nothin's what it seems,  
Maybe she'll start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams,  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose?  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains,  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  
She likes to pretend  
It's something that she must defend,  
With her pride

Close your eyes and she ascends  
Hold your breath and ease your mind  
Forty Thousand times  
Time fades into the night  
  
They descend and then they climb  
Feathers falling through the night

Writing poems to California  
Melodies of failure

Then we pray to our reflections  
In the water when it rises.  
  
I said headlights pin the highway down  
Jesus spins the world around  
And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down  
Goodbye all my days.  
I know I said I never loved you  
But I might just try again tonight.  
  
Truck stops and river Gods  
Gas stations of the Cross  
Following a ghost,  
Following a ghost,

The memories and the cost.  
  
Cary me south, to the sea  
Along with your memories of me  
We are born in the water  
Now we return to Thee.  
Colored lights  
And birthday cakes  
Candle wax  
On paper plates.

Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye.  
You can see through water  
All the way up to the sky.  
  
Gods of water, Gods of rain  
Cover up the sun again

To love you just the way you hoped I might,

When the weather bothers me  
I empty drawers of other summers  
Where my shadows used to be  
And she is standing by the water  
As her smile begins to curl  
In this or any other summer  
She is something altogether different  
Never just an ordinary girl  
  
And in the evenings on Long Island  
When the colors start to fade  
She wears a silly yellow hat  
That someone gave her when she stayed  
I didn't think that she returned it  
We left New York in a whirl  
Time expands and then contracts  
When you are spinning in the grip of someone  
Who is not an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she stays just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake the morning covers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again  
  
You send your lover off to China  
And you wait for her to call  
You put your girl up on a pedestal  
Then you wait for her to fall  
I put my summers back in a letter  
And I hide it from the world  
All the regrets you can't forget  
Are somehow pressed upon a picture  
In the face of such an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she fades just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake  
The morning showers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright

remembering again

You can still come round, crawl into my bed.  
You can live your life with whomever you please to,  
As long as someone takes good care of me  
You know I don't mind.  
How can I live without you  
If it means I gotta get a job?

Counting Crows,John Appleseed's Lament,/c/counting+crows/john+appleseeds+lament_21087600.html,"[Verse:]  
I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside  
I stepped out the door to New York City, my hair was barely dry  
I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside  
Nothin' happened in the elevator, nothing happening on the stairs  
Nothing ever happenin' when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there  
How'd you find a party when you're in your room?  
How'd you find the action man? The action is everywhere!  
And decide to climb outside your bedroom window, paint a picture on a clock  
Oh if you decide that you can't hide inside your mind  
Provide the slide to get you out  
Feels just like you're fallin' and you're goin' down  
And everybody luvs ya when you hit the ground  
I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to Pocahontas  
I pray to John Appleseed  
Oh, I cigarette the winter air, then I finna stare my way down 7th street  
Some chick yells Jesus luvs me more than I know but less than I need  
I play down the valley to the? And then I step off into the air  
Point my sunglasses east towards Jerusalem and then follow all the pharoahs
there  
They're buildin' pyramids in the Western Square  
Drivin' in circles 'round the circus til the circles in the air  
My love says come on Adam tell me what the hell is wrong with you  
She says, come on, Adam tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do!  
She says I could love you, I could leave you  
But I can't live what you put me through  
I call the winter Maria cuz I do not know her face  
I call the endless sky Emilia cuz she stays with me from place to place  
I call the sun my love Emanuel, she cradle me in her embrace  
I left, nothin' happening in the kitchen, nothing happening on the floor  
Nothin' happenin' in my bed, she don't sleep there no more  
Hard to find the bottom when you're in the air  
Hey man, how'd you find the circus, we have the circus is everywhere?

She shakes off the drop of daylight  
Water beading up her chest  
Bleeding down between her knees  
Rivers in Kentucky flow  
Between the bluegrass wavy seas  
But oh, Margery  
Twists the knife once more inside of me  
Breathless with anticipation  
Baited reelers set their hooks  
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass  
And lie and wait beside the brooks  
We're infants pushing slowly through  
Frustration leading back along  
The alleys of a childhood  
That will not release us willingly

Dust me off and shut me down  
And dream of where I haven't been  
Close the door inside my heart  
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind  
I have hollow eyes  
Haunting only to myself  
Even so, I can't stop calling  
These great big hollows in myself  
I took the train from California  
To the far side of the continent  
Woke up in Kentucky  
Where a wedding was about to end  
I looked up at Anna  
She turned back to look at me

Render blind the ones who see

I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host  
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts  
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast  
  
Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame  
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame  
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame  
And though I'll never forget your face,  
sometimes I can't remember my name  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry  
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing  
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings  
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring  
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything  
  
Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said  
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head  
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead  
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't go  
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep  
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep  
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep  
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep  
  
So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams  
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream  
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem  
But I'd sure like to find out  
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn  
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor  
and orders another  
Well, I wonder what he did that for  
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before  
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door  
  
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars  
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars  
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars  
You can see a million miles tonight  
But you can't get very far  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and  
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

Goes down for water

You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl  
She tells you she wanted to kiss you

So you know it's a good lie  
You can run outta choices and still hear  
A voice in your head when you're lying in bed  
And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it's okey  
The color of everything changes the sky rearranges it's shade  
And the smile doesn't fade into the phone call and one bad decision we've made

Down the tracks, stare off in the distance  
  
It's not far from here  
Mary waves 'Hello'  
Smiling though she's sinking  
In the shallow days below  
  
Oh no, I can't find a way out of here  
Out on the road again  
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she said but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
Through the shallow days down below  
  
You know I heard a band  
Playing waltzes in a grange hall  
The sun is sinking lower  
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself  
And nobody really knows her  
  
Any day now it's all right  
She tells herself that this will be the last time  
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders  
What she'll do with all her free time  
  
Not too far from here  
Mary turns to go  
Smiling while the waltz begins  
Dancing down the road  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Freedom  
What are we supposed to think?  
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she says but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
In the shallow days way down below  
  
""I'm sorry"", she said  
""I know it's not the kind of thing you want""  
I'm falling, falling down  
""I'm sorry"", she said  
""I know I'm not the kind of girl you want""

I used to ring you and put down the phone,  
Once wore a hole in your dress.  
Even tried Voodoo outside your home,  
But these days I couldn't care less.  
  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I let her go like the fool that I was,  
Thought I'd get over her soon.  
I smell her perfume when my eyes are closed,  
And I see her face in the moon.  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I tell myself it would be different now,  
I wouldn't treat her that way.  
I wouldn't be me if she wasn't her,  
And it's far too late, anyway.  
'Cause she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
Only inside you the ghost of the love,  
That is wordless and painful and old.  
There's no one else in the whole outside world,  
That matches to her in your soul.  
But she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.

I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives  
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side  
In a house where regret is a carousel ride  
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now...  
  
There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell  
There's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell  
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well'

And your eyes are so clear and so bright  
You'll make fools of the liars and creeps  
Put a rose in my cheeks  
But when demons have climbed on your back  
You are vicious and quick to attack  
And you put on a wonderful show  
Do you really, really think I don't know?

And you run like a cat to the cream  
And you're acting so nice it's obscene  
You put on a wonderful show  
Do you really, really think I don't know?

As I walk away from you  
  
Reveal whatever you desire  
To you it may be death defying  
Black day  
In the coldness of winter  
Black words  
Slipping off my tongue  
I say forget it - it's over  
As a dark cloud covered up the sun  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
The sun always sets  
With room for regrets  
As I walk away from you  
  
Give it to me  
Give it to me  
Your inspiration  
Give to receive  
Find all we need  
As I walk away  
  
Just a slave to ambition  
Tension your permanent condition  
So much you've always wanted  
Too much given' you a sore head

Wake up child,  
And throw your life away.  
See you in the crime file,  
What will your mama say?  
  
Sometimes you get angry,  
No focus in your life.  
When people get hungry,  
They learn how to survive.

Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
  
Summer syncopation,  
The space between your eyes.  
Is a place for heroes,  
That never compromise.  
  
Sometimes you feel lonely,  
No focus or surprise.  
Pushed into production,  
What a way to live our lives.

Abuse my heart

Hey devil kiss me  
I'm taking chances  
Not faking my culture  
The rhythm it dances  
I love your wisdom  
I love your mind  
White boys are babies (not my kind)  
This lust in fashion  
That's my sin

Watch it flow

Can't let go (falling out with the bad boys)

And locked up in boxes  
Yellow, black, red and white  
Like birds in their cages  
Beating their wings on the bars  
And there's a song that they're singing  
It's a word in the world

Tear apart hate

Slips away  
  
Why are the children  
Carrying guns, not books  
Drug dealing, not learning  
The golden rule  
And the idea of freedom  
Not just the same  
Castle in the sky  
Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls  
Filled with hate me  
And hate you  
And proud of it too

Tear apart hate

Running down the block  
Rock throwing, not knowing  
What else to do

And I can never know the pain  
But when I hear  
That whip cracking  
I cry out tears of anger  
I cry out tears of shame

Tear apart hate

Some wash up along the street

It's hard to keep that frame of mind  
Trying to move with the sun  
Gives the illusion that we're one  
I'll be running next to you  
We do what we need to  
  
Ohh, whoa

Ohh, whoa

And the road slows  
A lonely siren screeching 'round the bend  
The cool air blows  
Raising the hair on my skin  
We come face to face  
Try to let each other in  
  
Ohh, whoa

And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
  
Oh cyrus trusts the spirits  
And they fill his life with grace  
Yeah the father of his fathers  
Passed him down the gift of faith  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...  
  
And the two girls start to dancing  
When they hear that drunken voice  
That's when cyrus asks the moonlight  
Do I have to make a choice  
'tween liza with her red hair  
And ramona with her blues  
And with all these gifts they bring me  
Tell me how can I refuse  
  
Well the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to

Without a net on a real high wire  
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire  
I started dancing with a stranger  
  
Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger  
And I just got swept away  
Letting go my inhibitions  
  
Is harder to do than say  
But I surrender to the beat  
I start shuffling my feet  
When I hear that music play  
  
I trip the light fantastic  
I touch the sky and it feels like magic

Moving to the break of day

Give me a dance, dance  
Dancing with a stranger

I ain't looking for mister right  
It doesn't matter to me  
There's something in the air  
  
Electric I like  
Igniting endlessly

The crashing sounds  
Of fears I've never faced  
Let them echo off these waves  
With thoughts as brave as they once were

But just put them out of your mind, oh  
Heading for the moon  
Don't close your eyes

Under the night

I'll be wishing off the blue

To act just like a schoolgirl  
Followed your rules  
Just like a fool  
Wrapped up in your world  
What's good for you  
Don't mean that's so good for me  
What can I do, but hang around  
And lose myself just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
  
Well I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand  
And take things lying down like before  
Won't take your crap the way I used to  
Ain't gonna be the way it used to,  
Alright for you, ain't alright for me  
  
Maybe I was weak though the average  
Person probably thinks I'm stronger  
When I need someone else  
I shut out myself,  
Scared to say the wrong words  
What's right for you  
Don't think that's alright for me  
You spread the glue, so I can't move  
And stick to you just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw...  
  
Oh I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand...  
Ain't gonna do it like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
Alright for you ain't alright for me, no  
Every time you put me down  
Every time you screw me around  
Every time you do that to me

Of how he found you LORRAINE  
He's rocking on a porch you used to know  
Here where he swore his love was true  
He sips his drink and dreams the days of old  
Of when he fell, fell for you

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song,  
The music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling  
When you hear  
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old fashioned way

Was to leave her grubby life behind her

Tainted passion and temptation  
Led her down a trail of lust

Is written in the dust

Rock me tender in the night air

Rock me back and make me be there

That their hand usually does  
That she's got memory bubble

And they'll be standing in the closet  
And every dress is Savoir faire

With a pirate smile  
Make believe and play pretend  
We were innocent and wild  
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate  
Running down my alleyway  
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly  
  
We loved to watch them dive and soar  
Circle in the sky  
Free as a bird from three to four  
And never knowing why  
Neighbors pulled their wash back in  
Put away my Barbie and Ken  
Look out overhead  
While Sally's pigeons fly  
  
I had a fool's confidence  
That the world had no boundaries  
But instincts and common sense  
Come in different quantities  
  
My heart began to  
Skip to the beat  
Of the boy next door  
She had her eye across the street  
On someone shy and tall  
We lived our dreams  
And challenged fate  
In tears she told me she was late  
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...  
  
On the dresser sits a frame  
With a photograph  
Two little girls in ponytails  
Some twenty one years back  
She left one night with just a nod  
Was lost from some back alley job  
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly  
She never saw those birds again  
And me, I can't remember when  
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry  
I close my eyes

With my back to the wall  
Tell the world I'm not in  
I'm not taking the call  
Stone, the world is stone  
But I saw it once  
With the stars in my eyes  
When each color rang out  
In a thunderous chrome  
It's no trick of the light  
I can't find my way home  
In a world of stone

Cyndi Lauper,This Kind Of Love,/c/cyndi+lauper/this+kind+of+love_10074733.html,"This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
  
Woke up to find myself  
Standing in another day  
Filled with anxiety  
I'm praying for a different way  
I give it all I have  
Till I have no more to give  
I used to think I'd die for love  
Now I'd rather live  
If everywhere you look, you find some misery  
The view from there can make you feel  
Just a little crazy  
  
This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain, but...  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain  
  
Stay walking through life  
Waiting for the other shoe to fall  
Dreams cut like a knife  
When you think you shouldn't dream at all  
I saw a dark cloud  
Looks like it follows us around  
It doesn't take that much, you know  
To make it tumble down  
How did we ever go from being so happy  
To suffer alone and be strong  
Just so we can keep on giving up  
  
This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain, but...  
This kind of love's not true

On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
A little boy and our lady  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Oh they sailed to Bethlehem  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day

Caught up in circles  
Confusion is nothing new  
Flashback, warm nights  
Almost left behind  
Suitcases of memories,  
Time after  
  
Sometimes you picture me  
I'm walking too far ahead  
You're calling to me, I can't hear  
What you've said  
Then you say, go slow  
I fall behind  
The second hand unwinds  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
After my picture fades and darkness has  
Turned to gray  
Watching through windows  
You're wondering if I'm okay  
Secrets stolen from deep inside  
The drum beats out of time  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
You said go slow  
I fall behind

Play it over in my mind  
Hide your clothes behind the firelight  
Wrap me up inside your arms  
And every kiss will melt my lips apart  
Till the minutes stop and swallow up my heart  
  
When you go back to your world  
Does your head skip to me

There will come a sudden winter  
When she'll seek the warmth of day  
And there'll come a time when she will come to stay.  
  
The woman's like the tide  
She comes and goes  
She knows the things that I can just suppose.  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time that she laughs  
And the songs I sing cannot explain but half.

Some say she died of a sudden start  
  
Some say they found her swinging from my old man's tree  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
I can't believe they would pay men just to hunt me down  
  
But silver coins to each one do they give  
And by now there's a gallows standing in the town

I rode on the tractor with my dad  
And though we never had much it was always enough  
And we made the best with what we had  
But then came four years of drought and the bottom dropped out  
My father was broken like the rest  
And I can still see his hands signing over his lands  
And the bankers grow fat on the flesh of the dispossessed

Dan Fogelberg,Lovers In A Dangerous Time,/d/dan+fogelberg/lovers+in+a+dangerous+time_20035805.html,"The hours grow shorter as the days go by  
You never get to stop and open your eyes  
One day you're waiting for the sky to fall  
The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
These fragile bodies of touch and taste  
This vibrant skin, this hair like lace  
Spirits open to the thrust of grace  
Never a breath you can afford to waste  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime  
But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight  
You got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time

Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay?  
Now that we know  
The fire can burn bright or merely smolder  
How do we keep it from dying away?  
  
Elusive as dreams  
Barely remembered in the morning  
Love like a phantom flies  
But held in the heart  
It pales like the emply smile adorning  
A statue with sightless eyes  
  
Moments fleet, taste sweet within the rapture  
When precious flesh is greedily consumed  
But mystery's a thing not easily captured  
And once deceased not easily exhumed  
  
Now that we love  
Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay?  
  
Now that we loved  
Look at the moonless night and tell me  
How do we make love stay?

For the wind  
And the snow

I want a lover  
I want some friends  
And I want to live in the sun  
And I want to do all the things that I  
Never have done.  
  
Sunny bright mornings  
And pale moonlit nights  
Keep me from feeling alone

Nothing that I've ever known

And I've been on top  
But mostly I've lived in between  
And where do you go  
When you get to the end of  
Your dream?  
  
Off in the nether lands  
I heard a sound  
Like the beating of heavenly wings  
And deep in my brain  
I can hear a refrain  
Of my soul as she rises and sings  
Anthems to glory and  
Anthems to love and  
Hymns filled with early delight  
Like the songs that the darkness  
Composes to worship the light.  
  
Once in a vision  
I came on some woods  
And stood at a fork in the road  
My choices were clear  
Yet I froze with the fear  
Of not knowing which way to go.  
  
One road was simple  
Acceptance of life  
The other road offered sweet peace  
When I made my decision  
My vision became my release.

Who kept her warm and safe and dry  
She would have liked to say she loved the man  
But she didn't like to lie  
  
I said the years had been a friend to her  
And that her eyes were still as blue  
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw

Lover you used to know.  
He's in a nose dive  
Barely half alive

Someone's been telling you stories

And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand  
And I'm caught in the middle of something I don't really understand.  
He's gotten so lost  
He's been double-crossed  
By a change in the wind.  
  
He's gone solo again  
And he can't slow down now  
To pick up a friend.  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
No, they just ain't true

So you've heard I've been flyin'  
And tryin' to get into  
Somebody new  
And I'm off on a new love  
And don't hardly ever  
Think about you.

In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find.  
  
Now the dream is rising  
In a moment it will be past  
This breath is my first  
It will all too soon be my last.  
  
And on a windy coast  
I made several toasts  
To you and me and the sea  
And no one heard.  
  
Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.

Outward bound, there is music all around  
Can you hear it, it's the song of the sea  
  
Soundings taken at the edge of darkness  
The widest silences the heart can ever hear  
You can steer to the stars along your lee  
Set you bearings to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry you away, so far away  
Trim my sails to greet the breaking morning  
Past the headlands to the rolling open sea  
And it comes to me, I have never felt so free  
As when I'm listening to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry me away, so far away  
Some were meant to watch the world from windows  
And never look beyond the road beneath their feet  
But for me, I was always meant to be  
One forever chasing the song of the sea  
  
The song of the sea

Some morning while  
I was away.

Somewhere around Monterey.  
  
And here is the key  
To a house far away  
Where I used to live  
As a child.  
They tore down the building  
When I moved away  
And left the key unreconciled.  
  
And down in the canyon  
The smoke starts to rise.  
It rides on the wind  
Till it reaches your eyes.  
When faced with the past  
The strongest man cries...cries.

Dreaming that the looking glass was me  
Catching your fondest gazes  
Living through your fickle phases  
I love you  
  
And it's getting easier each day  
To weep about you  
Harder every night to sleep without you  
How many years must I be driven  
By this dream  
Of love with you?

Trying just to talk but  
You don't answer . . . you let it ring

Catching falling stars to  
Give to you, love

Lover has to face the truth  
And far too many stars have fell on me  
And as they trail the skies  
And burn their paths upon my eyes

Would listen

As free as a bird  
Flying from nest to nest.  
  
But somewhere our eyes met  
And our hands reached out  
And we felt a kindred spirit  
And as our faces touched  
I could feel the fire  
And needed so to just  
Be near it.  
  
Oh, lord  
Those moments we soared  
Borne on the wings of  
Our passion  
It seemed then  
Like they'd never end  
But times like that  
Always must.  
  
'cause then one day I flew  
Far away from you  
I never knew how I'd regret it  
My sweet magnolia belle  
You know I've loved you well  
Even if I never said it.  
  
Magnolia, now I see  
That freedom isn't free  
And love's the only true  
Redeemer  
And when this journey's  
Through  
I'll be coming back for you  
If you'll have this  
Foolish dreamer.

Passing through town on

The corner store and market where Stella used to sing to me  
Grace is all I'm asking  
When will Grace return?  
Grace is all I'm asking  
  
Remember how it feels  
Lazy days in the summertime  
Then my Stella smiled  
Stella said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?  
  
Tell me, Lord, when help is gonna come  
She said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?

The pastures were green and the meadows were gold  
Our life was in flower as summer grew on  
And life like the leaves now has withered and gone  
  
The roses have died, there's alone  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore  
The grass in the valley is starting to die  
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Oh, where have you gone, where can you be  
How you forsaken some others like me  
You promised to honor, to love and obey  
As each vow was a plaything that you threw away  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand

A hound in the distance beginning to bey  
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of  
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love

Like the leaves around a tree  
In their clothes of many colors  
For the angry gods to see  
And the women all were beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
They offered life in sacrifice

Through the window

Wear it so well  
Tied up and twisted  
The way I'd like to be

And her boyfriends shady, dates another girl named katie

Will this keep getting stronger  
I wonder what shes doing when I'm singing myself to sleep  
Cause hes a faker  
So see ya later  
I wonder when you realize that she means a lot more to me  
  
I saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over  
It was friday, school was out tonight  
Everything seems to be allright  
I said yo are you going to the party at the cove  
Hes picking me up six again and I don't wanna disappoint my boyfriend  
  
And shes staring at his picture hanging in her locker  
Shes telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her  
I saw what really happened all those times he went for water  
When we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter  
He had his hands on  
Every single girl he laid his eyes on  
Hate to break it to you, hes a pylon  
And even when he kissed her  
He was looking over, staring at her sister

Believing in something  
Tell me everything is all taken care

One day, do you think we'll wake up in a world on it's way to getting better?  
And if so can you tell me  
How?  
  
I have been thinking that lately the blood is increasing  
The tourniquets not keeping hold in spite of our twisting  
Though we would like to believe we are  
We are not in control  
Though we would love to believe

We used to be together.

And it's heavy on my mind  
  
I could never love again  
So much as I love you  
Where you end, where I begin  
Is like a river running through  
  
Take my eyes, take my heart  
I need them no more  
If never again I fall upon the one I so adore  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
How could I ever dream to find  
Sweet love like you again  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
One more drink and I'll be gone  
  
You think of things impossible  
Then the sun refuse to shine  
I walk with you beside me  
Your cold hand lay in mine  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll go  
Excuse me please, one more drink

I'm supposed to take it all myself  
To get out of this place.

She hears the cars scream out from outside  
And she whispers sometimes about this

He says take what you can from your dreams  
Make them real as anything  
It takes the work out of the courage

There's a crazy man standing outside my door  
I live on the corner of a dead end street  
At the end of the world.  
  
Oh, and the rocks out in the heart fall  
And she dreams her way to life  
And she knows no one will lift her  
So she might as well do it herself

Oh, well then baby it's right  
You say you think you are nothing  
No one else will do it for you

When you are waiting for what's right  
Youre holding on your heaven  
Wont leave you, yeah, yeah...

For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear  
But late at night, when the north wind blows  
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

I'd fill each hour with praises and shower you  
If I held the sun inside my hands  
I'd shine it bright inside your heart  
  
And I'd turn my praise and focus to the thought of you  
And stand you there  
A statue in my soul forever  
  
I dreamed I saw you dancing and I joined you there  
And spun we did in the moon's warm light  
  
Know I dreamed that they take away everything that you held close and
sorrowful for  
I will love you like no man can and we will dance at the ide of love  
I'll take the moon I'll take the sun from the starry sky  
And decorate your nights with light and shadow like no other can, bright  
  
I will dream of stealing you from all the things that bother and hurt you  
You my love and only love alone  
  
If I could make another day for you  
And shadows taken all of you, and shadows taken all of you  
And I can see my heart beat louder and my face grow warm  
Each time you stand by me my only love, ray on me  
  
So if you your man and family do remember this the time we only caught short
view  
Of each other while in some it shine  
I will rake in each day and sell it to you  
And sell it to you and sell it to you my love  
  
No captain but you my love  
No king but you

How we move our lives for another day  
Like skipping a beat  
What if a great wave should wash us all away  
Just thinking out loud  
Don't mean to dwell on this dying thing  
But looking at blood  
It's alive right now  
Deep and sweet within  
Pouring through our veins  
Intoxicate moving wine to tears  
Drinking it deep  
Then an evening spent dancing  
It's you and me  
This love will open our world  
From the dark side we can see a glow of something bright  
There's much more than we see here  
Don't burn the day away  
Is this not enough  
This blessed sip of life  
Is it not enough  
Staring down at the ground  
Oh then complain and pray more from above  
Greedy little pig  
Stop just watch your world trickle away  
Oh it's your problem now  
It'll all be dead and gone in a few short years  
Just love will open our eyes  
Just love will put the hope in our minds  
Much more than we could ever know  
Don't burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
I'm saying open up  
And let the rain come pouring in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while you're dancing on the ground  
Don't think of when you're gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Don't beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times  
But that's ok  
Just look for love in it  
Don't burn the day away  
Look  
Here are we  
On this starry night staring into space  
And I must say  
I feel as small as dust  
Lying down here  
What point could there be troubling  
Head down wondering what will become of me  
Why concern we cannot see  
But no reason to abandon it  
Time is short but that's all right  
Maybe I'll go in the middle of the night  
Take your hands from your eyes, my love  
Everything must end some time  
Don't burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
I'm saying open up  
And let the rain come flooding in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while you're dancing on the ground  
Don't think of when you're gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Don't beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times

Why rain?

Oh, I am the devil, I am rain

Climb the castle wall

For it there is no measure  
Of one thing I know

You drive me crazy

You make me feel high

Is like I'm drunk

By the fire with the snow outside

Oh child hold tight  
If it gets to be a crazy ride  
I'll be here right by your side  
For the rest of our days  
Oh, for the rest of our days  
  
So right  
Holding on to this crazy ride  
Hold on we'll be alright  
Me and you and you and me  
Here you come you bring me real love  
From the ground beneath to the stars above  
I was growing down now I'm growing up  
With you in my blood  
Yeah this is real love  
Shining down like the stars above  
Arms out and I am growing up  
With you in my blood  
Oh you know that its alright  
Feels bigger than the whole world wide  
You know come the morning light  
Oh I know that I am yours  
That I am yours  
That I am yours

I'm a stranger in the eyes of the Maker  
I could not see for the fog in my eyes  
I could not feel for the fear in my life  
  
From across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light  
Of John Baptist walking to me with the Maker  
My body my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep  
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away  
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker  
  
Brother John, have you seen the homeless daughters  
Standing here with broken wings  
I have seen the flaming swords  
There over east of Eden  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
  
Oh, river rise from your sleep

While you lie around  
With your hands up and out  
So resigned you will fall down  
  
While you around here play  
Wild on the warm and far away  
While you around here play

With a fool holding hands  
With a one-eyed jack of spades  
While on the deck they sing  
All of the captain's cards are kings  
Still he and the queen are lost at sea

Becoming one in a million  
Slip into the crowd

Spot in the middle  
Static fade, statistic bit  
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away

Smell touch feel  
How could this rhythm ever quit  
Bags packed on a plane

Hard to believe an end to it

Maybe things won't be better than they have been here  
Here in the warehouse

How I love to stay here

Every man and woman get alive  
  
That's our blood down there  
Seems poured from the hands of angels  
But trickle into the ground  
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty  
  
My heart's numbered beat  
Still echo in this empty room  
Fear wells in me  
But nothing seems enough to defend  
So I am going away...

But he sees Lord what they can't understand  
It's the 33rd of August Lord and I'm finally coming down  
Eight days from Sunday finds me Saturday bound  
  
Once I stumbled through the darkness fell down to my knees

Woke up in a squad car busted down for vacancy  
And outside my cell it's sure as hell it looked like rain  
Now I've got my dangerous feeling under lock and chain  
I've killed my violent nature with a smile  
Though the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain  
Not all my God like thoughts Lord were defiled

With a price tag on her body and a tombstone in her eye  
You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring  
Past the other side of nowhere at a man she'd like to try  
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions  
Of her body fom the music or the crowd  
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket  
While she showed us everything the law allowed  
(Play it Pete Drake)  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment  
I was feeling weak from all the seeds I'd sown  
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body  
To some pleasures it had never ever known  
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me  
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun  
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder  
If she ever felt ashamed of what we'd done  
So I left her in Atlanta...

Along the green and golden paths  
That took us home away from Crazy Mary  
  
In the lamplight burning low  
Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...  
  
So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary

David Allan Coe,For Your Precious Love,/d/david+allan+coe/for+your+precious+love_20201436.html,"You know when I first started doing this album I thought  
All these songs about just gettin' the divorce  
And there was one thing I wanted to tell you darlin' darlin'  
Before the music stops for me and you and that's what you meant to me  
And even thought the divorce is final now  
I wanted to sing you this one last love song  
  
Your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For that's what love will do  
And darlin' (I'm so surprised) oh when I first realized  
That you weren't fooling me  
And darlin' they say that our love won't grow  
But I just want to tell them that they don't know  
For as long as you're in love with me our love will grow wider depper than any
sea  
And of all the things all the things that I want in this whole wide world  
Is just for you to say that you'll be my girl  
Oooh (wanting you) I'm wanting you (I'm so blue) oh that's what live will do  
  
I gave it a hundred and ten percent of my soul  
And I tried everything I could to hold it together  
But now that it's over I just wanted you to know  
That anytime you have sunshine you're gonna have bad weather  
Some people they can handle that and some people can't  
Just for the record another chapter in my life  
And you were that chapter just divorced  
Maybe they should write that on my tombstone darlin'  
Would that make you happy then  
Your precious love means more...

David Allan Coe,Fraulein,/d/david+allan+coe/fraulein_20199193.html,"Far across the deep blue waters lives an old German's daughter  
On the banks of the old River Rhine  
Where I loved her and left her now I can't forget her she is my pretty
Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river each night when the stars start to
shine  
By the same stars above you I swear that I love you you are my pretty Fraulein

When the memory wanders away over yonder to that cute girl that I left behind  
In a moment of glory her face comes before me the face of my pretty Fraulein

You are my pretty Fraulein

It wasn't nothing she had done or nothing she could say  
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin  
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend  
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket there's no anchor on my feet  
If my sleepin' bag gets dusty and there's not enough to eat  
I may stay an extra day till I find another town  
You can bet there's not a lady that can show this freight train down  
And I'll be moving in the morning leaving you behind  
If anyone should ask you you can tell them they will find  
Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand  
And I'll always be remembered as a free born rambling man  
[ guitar ]  
Lord tell the children when they find me that I died but not in vain  
They can find reincarnation in the whistle of a train  
And each time they hear the whistle blow through the stillness of the land  
They'll know that I was happy as a free born rambling man  
And I'll be moving...

Bought a motorcycle in his younger days  
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band  
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land  
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew  
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do  
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal  
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field  
  
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised  
  
Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew  
Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue  
A barefoot bearded swamp rat  
But a man above all others  
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers

David Allan Coe,Gone (Like),/d/david+allan+coe/gone+like_20585998.html,"She's taken to walking alone in the evening  
She's taken to sleeping all night in his chair  
Together they both had a reason for living  
Back when the felling of loving was there  
Then she took to dreaming when he wasn't looking  
And he took to looking for moments alone  
Together they drifted apart from each other  
Together they both knew the felling was gone  
Gone like the sparrow south for the winter  
Gone like the river out to the sea  
Gone like the leaves from the trees when its snowing  
Gone like the love that they once gave so free  
Till he took to starring at his lonesome shadow  
And she took to humming the words to some song  
They both felt it slipping that feeling of giving  
Leaving the feeling of being alone  
Each of them reach out for the other  
Together they go though the motions alone  
Trying to pretend that nothing else matters  
Making believe that their love isn't gone

Thrown without no caution to the wind

Too ashamed to look her in the eye

Sneakin' in her house at 3 a.m.

Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been  
True love has no pride but he's not satisfied  
Unless he has her at his beck and call

Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been

Covered with grease from his head to his feet

Chewed tobacco from a mail pouch sack  
Had an old dog that was trained to attack sometimes  
He'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake  
And there wasn't too much that he would take from a stranger  
There were thirteen kids and a bunch of dogs  
A house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs

She's been through hell since junior went to jail  
When the lights go out she ain't never failed  
To get down on her knees and pray because she loves him  
Told all the neighbors he was off in the war  
Fightin' for freedom he's good to the core and she's proud  
Now our place was a graveyard for automobiles  
At the end of the porch there was four stacks of wheels  
And tires for sale for a dollar or two cash  
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof

But I didn't think that would give me a drink  
So I blamed it on Korea

I got shrapnel from a grenade

Put a glas of lemonade  
How that I've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet  
And I never forget that hot August night

Give her hell for us

SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN THAT KIND OF WOMAN  
SHELL DRINK WHISKEY AND DANCE TILL THE CHAMPAGNES ALL GONE  
SHELL BE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE AIR FROM THE OCEAN IS CALLING  
TELLING YOU, SAILOR BEWARE! SOMETHING IS WRONG!  
  
BUT TOUCHING HER MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR BLUES TONIGHT  
HOLDING HER MIGHT STOP THE PAIN IN TIME  
KISSING HER MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE LONELINESS YOU FELL  
BUT LOVING HER WILL MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND  
  
JUST LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS SHELL BE GONE IN THE MORNING  
LEAVING YOU EMPTY AND DRAINED, LIKE THE TIDE YOU'LL BE LOW  
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL BETTER  
YOU'LL TRY TO BUY HER WITH PRESENTS , BUT SAILOR I KNOW.

David Allan Coe,Maria Is A Mystery,/d/david+allan+coe/maria+is+a+mystery_20585958.html,"Maria has a music box she winds up most every day  
Once a week is all it takes to make the music play  
Melody is just some childhood lullaby her mother used to sing to her  
And the road down to the city goes right by Maria's door  
I often walk right by her house on my way to the store  
Up there where those Italian mothers dress their shivering bambinos for the
rain  
She tells me about Jesus and all his gallant men I tell her about fantasy  
Maria she's this lady on my way down to the river Maria she's a mystery  
Maria she's a mystery  
  
Yeah passing by this morning I drew a picture in my hand  
Our bodies in some candlelight that glowed upon our skin  
Maybe if I touched her she would disappear like angels in a dream  
She tells me about Jesus  
La la la la la la

When they put those bars between old Merle and me  
  
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall  
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds  
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last  
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me  
  
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend  
Acting like wed never been in reform school  
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high  
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me  
  
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done  
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know  
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell  
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me  
  
How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row  
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair  
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door

And the love that used to be

On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets

She's the best thing in this life  
Why she worships the ground that he walks on  
She waits up for him at night and worries  
Until he's safely home  
And she always believes his stories about working overtime  
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind  
  
Aw but it crossed his  
Early last summer  
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend  
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave
in  
And now he wishes he could stop himself  
But theres no easy way  
So he lays down with his lover  
And silently he prays  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know  
  
In his heart and soul  
He knew he was playing a game he could never win  
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet  
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again  
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way  
To fight the feeling  
So he prays this simple pray  
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know

Medals gleamin' in the sun  
Cussin' at my long hair  
And my talk of bein' free  
Their vision like their battle scars  
  
Of other wars has faded  
Like the colors on the ribbons  
From the battles that they've won

And rambles somewhere in his mind  
Mumbling 'bout the Civil War  
And how we should have won  
  
Settin' up his battle plans  
On checkerboards at his command  
Watchin' all his gallant kings  
Go falling one by one

For you to straighten out your mind

Never understanding why

When we ride through town  
But I know when the chips fall  
She won't let me down  
She knows how to run  
And she don't run around on her man  
She's a high flyin' lady  
She takes me where I want to be  
There's no other woman  
Standing between her and me  
I'll always be faithful  
And keep her 'til the end of time

That old Panhead of mine  
I've seen fancy dressers  
And they've caught my eye  
I rode'em to ride'em  
Then I told them goodbye  
I flirted with Low Riders  
Sportsters and Shovelheads too

And kicked her to just get her started

Well, I saw my first rodeo in Amarillo, Texas  
Busting broncos is more than just a way to make a living  
Horses were like women, they were fast and fancy free  
  
I saw Shirley stoker up in pan head West Virginia  
Her and Connie Shovelhead was standing in the rain  
Both of them were dressers, Lord they sure were looking pretty  
Motorcycle fever has almost drove me insane  
  
Eighteen were rollin' when I climbed up in that Ken Worth  
Me oh my, that semi was the apple of my eye  
Horses, trucks and motorcycles sure makes life worth living  
Hope I never see the day, I kiss them all good bye

'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones
quit singing. George was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings like
he wishes he had a drink.  
  
Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
  
I know friday night he'll do it all again  
  
Oh he'll drink till he falls down  
  
Then he'll order one more round

Could sure become A drag

David Bowie,'87 And Cry,/d/david+bowie/87+cry_20036844.html,"It's just a one dollar secret  
A lover's secrets in the UK  
Torn apart in the UK  
In the dribble of May-Day  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
And there's nothing inside  
And there's nothing in mind  
And only you  
Rocket on through the sky  
It couldn't be done without dogs  
It couldn't be once without us  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
  
When the days were the days were the days boys  
When blue ties were for the biggy guys  
Frannie dressing down for the enemy  
You saw him hangin' on the enemy  
And there's no one in love  
And there's nowhere to scream  
And only you  
Race on to wonder where  
It couldn't be done without dogs  
It couldn't be once without us  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
You can't make love with money  
You can't make mistakes with babies  
Nothing looked good on you  
That's how I liked you best  
Now you're ready for the real McCoy  
  
Deep in the heart of Cupid  
Murders on the heels of love  
Just the ghost of a story  
Just a one dollar secret  
Baby these were the sounds  
Baby these were the sounds  
And only you  
Whisper these things aren't true  
It couldn't be done with dogs  
It couldn't be once without us

Of the dreams that he brings  
From the wide open sea  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps  
To the old Willow tree  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries  
In a drunken town fight  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who's born  
On a hot muggy morn  
By the dawn's early light  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
Where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats  
Only fish heads and tails  
And he'll show you his teeth  
That have rotted too soon  
That can haul up the sails  
That can swallow the moon  
  
And he yells to the cook  
With his arms open wide  
""Hey, bring me more fish  
Throw it down by my side""  
And he wants so to belch  
But he's too full to try  
So he stands up and laughs  
And he zips up his fly  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
You can see sailors dance  
Paunches bursting their pants  
Grinding women to porch  
They've forgotten the tune  
That their whiskey voice croaked  
Splitting the night  
With the roar of their jokes  
And they turn and they dance  
And they laugh and they lust  
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  
And then out of the night  
With their pride in their pants  
And the sluts that they tow  
Underneath the street lamp  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who drinks  
And he drinks and he drinks  
And he drinks once again  
He'll drink to the health  
Of the whores of Amsterdam  
Who've given their bodies  
To a thousand other men  
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue  
Their goodness all gone  
For a few dirty coins  
When he just can't go on  
Throws his nose to the sky  
Aims it up above  
And he pisses like I cry  
On the unfaithful love

And we'd talk with our eyes  
Of the sweetness in our lives  
And tomorrows of rich surprise...  
Some things we could do  
  
In our madness  
We burnt one hundred days,  
Time takes time to pass  
And I still hold some ashes to me,  
An Occasional Dream.  
  
And we'd sleep, oh so close,  
But not really close our eyes  
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...  
Gently weeping nights  
It was long, long ago  
And I can't touch your name.  
For the days of fater were strong for you...  
Danced you far from me.  
  
In my madness  
I see your face in mine.

It burns my wall with time

Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad  
But fooling around, it will make me sad  
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys

David Bowie,Ballad Of The Adventurers,/d/david+bowie/ballad+of+the+adventurers_20036975.html,"Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten  
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair  
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten  
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there  
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades  
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid  
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies  
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed  
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans  
Though his mother has given him up for lost  
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition  
Always in search of that land where life seems best  
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises  
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face  
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises  
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

And sugar horses painted red  
  
Rich men's children running past  
Their fathers dressed in hose  
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes  
Gazing eyes and running wild  
Past the stocks and over stiles  
Kiss the window merry child  
But come and buy my toys  
  
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn  
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn  
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, thrashed it with a quill  
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will  
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys  
Leave the parsley on the stalls  
Come and buy my toys  
  
You shall own a cambric shirt  
You shall work your father's land  
But now you shall play in the market square  
Till you'll be a man  
  
Smiling girls and rosy boys  
Come and buy my little toys  
Monkeys made of gingerbread

With buttholes for their brains

May death be on your brow  
May razors slash your mainline

May all your vilest nightmares  
Consume your shrunken head  
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia  
Dance upon your stinking bed  
Don't look at me you fuckhead  
This nation's turning blue  
Its stink it fouls the highways  
Its filth, it sticks like glue

And place you underground  
The hatred of yourself  
And the sufferings that conspire  
To take your little body  
And throw it to the fools  
Only your mind can take you out of this  
Only your mind or death  
I'm riding on the subway  
The subway down to Hell  
I've finished with this journey

Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent  
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.

It produced sounds of wailing, crying.

For their mother.  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean  
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared  
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak  
Into the paper bag at her side  
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed  
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind  
  
Crying  
""God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God may look the other way today  
  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God may look the other way today""  
  
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag  
Perspiration trickled down her forehead  
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder  
She was led away bewildered and amazed  
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter  
As her escort asked her softly  
For her name  
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady  
Who had fainted to the whirling  
Wooden floor  
  
Crying  
""God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
Surely God won't look  
The other way  
  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
Surely God won't look  
The other way""

We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here

Growing potatoes by the score

Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist  
Once he had a name, now he plays our game  
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang  
  
Molly is the model in the ads  
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip  
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong  
Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang  
  
Arthur is a singer with a band  
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage  
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid  
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang  
  
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins  
It's a big illusion but at least you're in  
At least you're in  
  
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick  
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff  
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke  
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang  
  
This is what to do now that you're here  
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast  
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars  
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

His beads are all he owns

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos  
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before  
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life  
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why

We played Our songs and felt the London sky  
Resting on our hands  
It was God's land.  
It was ragged and naive.  
It was Heaven.  
  
Touch, we touched the very soul  
Of holding each and every life.  
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.  
It didn't, but it seemed that way.  
I kissed a lot of people that day.  
  
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,  
To paint that love upon a white balloon,  
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his  
Brain.  
Satoria must be something just the same.  
  
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
size.  
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.  
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head  
And away they soared,  
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.  
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.  
And we walked back to the road, unchained.

And I can't get away  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
And there's the dark, begins to rain  
The sound is heavy on me  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Under the spell I wanna be under your touch  
Under the spell I wanna be under the rush  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you  
  
Baby when the lights go out  
I hear you calling (I hear you calling)  
Baby when the lights go out  
I need you

David Guetta,Bang My Head,/d/david+guetta/bang+my+head_21091198.html,"[Sia:]  
I was bound, was tired  
Hadn't seen a light so long  
Thought I lost my fight  
Couldn't find my way back home  
And I found the light stepping out of me  
I was bound, and tired  
Waiting for daylight  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed  
I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead I rose above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you think you're giving up  
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't  
And you feel the love stepping out of you  
But when you think of giving up, don't  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang your head up against the wall  
You may feel light headed, but you won't crawl, no, you won't fall  
You will rise above it all  
You'll find what you're searching for  
And you may feel light headed  
You think you're gonna hit the floor  
Instead you rise above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang your head against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Instead you rise above it all  
(Bang my head against the wall)  
  
[Bridge:]  
I have broken wings  
I keep trying, keep trying  
No one get out  
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Bang my head against the wall  
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall  
I will rise above it all  
Found what I was searching for  
Though I feel light headed, I should have failed, and nailed the floor  
Instead I rose above it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head up against the wall  
Oh, oh, oh  
Bang my head against the wall  
Bang my head against the wall  
Instead I rise above it all
