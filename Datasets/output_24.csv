I'm lookin' for old Sukie Jones, she crazy horse saloon  
Barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye  
She turned to give me a wink, that'd make a grown man cry

Come easy, go easy, all right until the rising sun  
I'm calling all the shots tonight, I'm like a loaded gun  
Peelin' off my boots and chaps, I'm saddle sore  
Four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more  
Fools' gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet  
No tongue's drier than mine, I'll come when I get back!  
  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol  
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful  
I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle  
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle

Aerosmith,Battlefield,/a/aerosmith/battlefield_20644493.html,"It cannot be seen  
But there's blood on the green  
Only god knows I'm innocent  
Take me, take me home  
A dark seed reigns in me  
Like the storm rules over the sea  
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone  
  
Don't dare me now  
The threatening shadows will pass by  
There're getting closer now  
Open your eyes  
Wake up my dear young friend  
And hate shall fade away  
  
I will not move, yet  
I'll stand still, instead  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
The field's been left in sorrow  
The father and the son  
They're gone  
  
The sun shines bright  
And anger rises  
Lorn and lonely  
Torn apart  
Don't you think  
It's time to stop now  
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss  
  
Let's pray  
That heaven is on our side  
Through violence and horror  
Shall honour arise  
  
So let's pray  
And blessed shall be our leader  
We follow the noble and bright  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Crying  
Come take me away  
I hallow thy name  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
That's what minstrel sing  
Join in the horrible screams  
Take part in murderous deeds  
Renowned be the lion-hearted  
Join in the minstrelsy  
Wailing in endless grief  
It eagerly longs for more  
Broken bodies lay down on the ground  
  
Blood sheds all over the place  
The green will be stained forever  
And hate reigns all over the field  
They keep struggling on in anger  
  
Fiercely intense  
Outrageous, too blind to see  
And in pain they keep on singing  
We claim the land for the highlord  
God bless the land and our highlord  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore

You may be a lady  
But I'll knock you out  
Wrap my knuckles upside your head  
Make you take back  
Every damn thing you said  
You play with me  
Gonna pay the price  
No ghost of a chance  
I'm holdin the dice  
You lie about this and  
Lie about that  
Don't wanna hear  
Nothing about no more crap

Now you don't  
Someone's gonna take it away  
Now you see it

Turned to page six  
She was in her birthday suit  
Behind a crucifix

She was puss n' boots way up to here  
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7  
A 10 every day of the year  
  
Now there must be some mistake  
I'm feelin' so high strung  
She said 'I make love like a snake  
I even got a forked tongue'  
  
At first I thought I was dreamin'  
That I'd wake up and she'd disappear  
But when I opened up my eyes  
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier

The sun through the rain  
Until you are free  
And facing the truth  
That words can't explain  
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)  
I could never let you go

Something you can't describe American pride  
Dad said, ""Son I'm proud you won  
But the game is more than any toy""  
Mama said, ""Now Son say sir and say ma'am  
And be proud you're southern born""  
You play when you're hurt and you work when you're tired  
'Cause that was Grandpa's way  
And the biscuits are better at Granny's house  
And the gravy taste great all day  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
Something you can't describe, something you cannot hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
When a baby is born we all celebrate  
With tears of joy in family eyes  
'Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride  
Yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways  
And we don't all look alike  
But if the cause is right we stand up and fight  
To protect our American pride  
Sing it, sing it, sing it  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
It's something you can't describe, it's something you can't hide  
American pride something you feel inside

Alabama,Angels Among Us,/a/alabama/angels+among+us_20005144.html,"I was walkin'home from school  
On a cold winter day,  
Took a short cut through the woods  
And I lost my way.  
It was gettin' late, and I was scared and alone.  
Then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home.  
Mama couldn't see him,  
But he was standing there,  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayer.

Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us,  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hours  
To show us how to live  
To teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times  
And had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone  
To come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger  
To lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend  
Just to say I understand  
Now ain't it kind of funny  
At the dark end of the road  
Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.

They wear so many faces,  
Show up in the strangest places  
And grace us with their mercies in our time of need.

And the mortgage replaced the rent

So he retired in '69  
And left with oh so little time

And placed a rose between their names  
Now that's the most that ever came

And though I miss them oh so much

And the pleasure of just growing up

The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done  
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife  
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.

I saw the time  
When we walked the streets without risk  
And families still prayed and hugged and kissed  
  
I saw the time  
When nature was so clean  
We could eat from the field and streams  
I saw the time  
And when the bombs would not explode  
And all the people got to vote  
I saw the time, I saw that time  
  
Oh, I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When we went to the moon  
And disaster struck too soon  
I saw that time  
When little Samantha Smith was so brave  
And made that grin and call  
  
And when the Bears' Vincent Woody  
Paced the sidelines and coached football  
When John, George and Martin walked around  
(I saw the time)  
When John, Paul, George and Ringo  
Brought the sound  
  
When everybody held hands  
And the children smiled, mama's and daddy?s smiled  
Grandma?s and Grandpa?s smiled, and God smiled  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, whoa, I saw the time

Took off my work clothes and left them right there on the floor

And just to make it easier for her, I left the light on on the porch

I get lost in the shadows of your warm embrace  
And you rush into my arms  
My emotions run wild  
And we're off to a love world

And no more with old Shep will I roam

I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you

And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school

I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home

And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,

Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home

But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth

His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didn't understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James

I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me

I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show  
Daddy came down about noon, and said  
Son, I've got some news  
Lord's rested old Dillon's soul  
Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon

""For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down  
In words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.  
There is, however, a class of fancies of exquisite delicacy which are not  
Thoughts, and to which as yet I have found it absolutely impossible to  
Adapt to language. These fancies arise in the soul, alas how rarely.  
Only at epochs of most intense tranquillity, when the bodily and mental  
Health are in perfection. And at those weird points of time, where the  
Confines of the waking world blend with the world of dreams. And so I  
Captured this fancy, where all that we see, or seem, is but a dream within  
A dream. ""

Living his life in vain

You're never going to get here

And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Call along the valley  
And you just may find us there  
I couldn't say for certain  
Cause we may be anywhere  
Head into the sunset  
Or just wander out to sea  
Wherever your heart leads you  
Is the place you're meant to be  
  
And someone who could be impressed  
With ordinary lies  
Could really use a little peace of mind

You don't have to save your wildest dreams for the night

Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out  
Some you win and some you lose  
And some will bring you sorrow

Rise above the crest

Don't allow the world of men  
To turn your head no more

Yes it's funny you should say that

Where I caught and ate a whale  
Then I woke up feeling hungry, he said  
That's a curious tale  
For a dream contains a wish  
In this case a giant fish  
As the pressure you were under  
Might have woken you from slumber

Must protrude beyond the sheet  
While you sleep they're unprotected

You were trying to dream some heat

In the dead of the night  
On the branch of a tree

And they're shining so bright

And they have such big ears

Where I turned into a snail  
And he said it is simplicity  
To follow such a trail  
For this creature takes his shell  
Anywhere that he may roam  
  
But work must keep you on the move  
You fear your wife may disapprove  
So in the dream you just remove  
And take along your home  
  
If I step on a line  
Something will happen  
There are rats in a jar  
Something will happen  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright

Nothing wrong with that  
As I sit here in my chair  
I can see your growth is spare  
And it is my observation  
That this caused you much frustration  
So you dreamed a consolation  
To replace the loss of hair  
  
I'm going to be a mother  
I'm going to have a child

There are rats in the jar

I can not say why  
I can not say why  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
Just a traveler, on an endless flight  
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night  
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall  
To believe in so many truths  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense at all  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
I was afraid, cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

Locked in the mind on the edge of time  
Like a ship lost in a storm  
How do we find the key  
Longing to see, through the artist's eye  
Maybe only birds can fly  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
One day to fly  
  
Someone said and I believe  
Try if you dare, you can walk on air  
A dream is all you need  
A circle that takes you high  
Lighter than air as the earth goes by  
Through a spiral in the sky  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
  
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas  
Made them laugh but now they see  
That the artist had a vision  
That the wind could set us free  
It's a bridge until tomarrow  
Taking us beyond the sun  
As the artist paints his picture  
The story's just begun  
  
Analyzing, criticizing  
Fear of the unknown  
Theorizing, visualizing  
The road to take us home  
If it takes forever  
Someone's gonna fly  
We may never get to heaven  
But still we're gonna try  
  
Watching the birds  
As they sail on the wind  
One day to fly

And a morbid fear of eating beans

And she said psychoanalysis was just the thing for me

Wore stiletto heels and rubber

of the Smile of the clown  
So I close my eyes  
Till I can't see the light  
And I hide from the sound

Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out  
  
I can hear the cry  
Of the leaf on a tree  
As it Falls to the ground  
I can hear the call  
of an Echoing voice  
And there's no one around  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out

You and I came a long way  
The nights, too short to fill with sleep  
Or falling in too deep  
Seem so far away now  
  
Memories, all we share between us  
Everything we were, all that we remain  
But memories somehow came between us  
Breaking up two minds that were one and the same  
  
The years are moments passing by  
No time to wonder why  
You and I went the wrong way  
The days too short to fill with dreams  
Or question what it means  
Are a part of me now  
  
Remember all the leaves were falling  
Walking hand in hand, standing in the rain  
Remember distant voices calling  
Whispers in the dark, I can hear them again  
  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round

But just when I need you  
You won't be there  
  
I'll hold on but I need a shoulder to lean on  
Why if you love me must you leave me  
Why are you going anywhere  
Why must our love be something in the air  
Cause just when I need you  
You won't be there  
You won't be there

Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?  
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.  
  
I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless,  
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.  
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?  
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.  
  
Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes,  
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies,  
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee,  
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

Faces of friends in the crowd  
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders  
Driven away by the sound  
  
Now the heart that for years had been silent  
Was suddenly filled with the new King  
As she clung to their hands like a child in the night  
She found herself this revelling  
  
What sweeter music can we bring,  
Than a carol for to sing  
The birth of this our heavenly King?  
The birth of this our heavenly King?

When troubles come and my heart burdened be  
Then I am still and wait here in the silence  
Until you come and sit awhile with me  
  
There is no life, no life without its hunger  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly  
But when you come and I am filled with wonder  
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity  
  
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up to more than I can be.

Alice Cooper,A Bedtime Story,/a/alice+cooper/a+bedtime+story_20521895.html,"Lay still, Steven, and I'll tell you a bedtime story.  
I'll tell you a bedtime story that's not for all  
Children. It's a very special story, that only special  
Children will understand. It's a half-awake story, and  
It will be better if you close your eyes. It's a  
Story that takes place in a dream, like other  
Nightmares you have known. It's a dream that Alice has  
Dreamed. You can dream along with him. You can follow  
Alice down the staircase, deep, down the stairs to the  
Pit where he doesn't want to go, but he has to.  
  
If you go to sleep now, Steven, you can go down the  
Long and endless stairway and sing sweet songs to Alice  
And free him. And if you can't get to sleep, Steven,  
And in the middle of the night you get out of bed, when  
Everything is quiet and the trees are still and the  
Birds are hiding from the dark, you can lie down on  
Your bedroom floor and press your ear tightly to the  
Boards. If you listen very carefully you can hear  
Alice searching for a way out, forever chasing  
Rainbows.  
  
Sleep tight, Steven. And have a good night.

You left a message on the telephone  
From New York City, your new home  
You didn't like the neighborhood  
You really hated Hollywood

You said my house is small  
You like it fifty stories high  
You like livin' tall  
  
You hate the L.A. freeways  
You hate the L.A. smog  
You hate the west coast phonies  
You like the city dogs  
  
I'm confused but I'm not mad  
Said I'm the worst you've ever had  
I ain't delusional or institutional  
But I'm pretty sure I ain't that bad

Mama was a bitch

And they left poor Jackson inside  
  
Questions there were few  
In fact there were none  
When those Sheriff's bullets start to fly  
Lay dying on the floor  
With a smokin' forty four

And he craves it more and more  
Old men, ladies of the night walking in the rain  
If they walk alone are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
  
No one calls and no one visits  
We're like a couplet out of Desolation Row  
We don't want them to want to know us  
Cause when they do, they get a little bit too close  
  
Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast is all I'm living for  
and I crave it more and more  
Bad girls, cops on the beat in the midnight rain  
If they're out alone, are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me

a folding chair I was downing seagrams on another flight and I worked that

Militant mothers hiding in their basements  
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets  
  
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs  
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers  
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer  
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance  
  
Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours  
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father

Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess  
Yes I'm worried honey  
Guess that's natural though  
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign

In the place I've been  
And just like the first time

Sometims I break down and cry

I need a layer of skin  
I need a preacher breathing fire  
To burn away my sins  
  
And I can't help the victims  
On the side of the road  
And I can't stop the cyclone  
That's about to explode

Misunderstood it's just the wrong medication  
I wish, I wish, upon a star  
I wish it hadn't gone this far  
  
Been up so long it looks like down to me  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
Send me an angel, wrap me in her wings

Was of some place I'd never ever been

Never, ever cruel

The president plays golf with me  
I make Madonna faint  
  
So why am I so lonely  
Depressed and in despair  
If I pull this trigger in my mouth will anybody care  
  
It was the greatest funeral, I laid in perfect state  
And later I will meet the lord, I bet he just can't wait  
  
To meet the man of the year

Stand in line to meet the man

Alice Cooper,Might As Well Be On Mars,/a/alice+cooper/might+as+well+be+on+mars_20005789.html,"The city streets are wet with rain tonight  
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane  
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall  
Midnight blues comin' through the walls  
  
I tried to call you on the telephone  
I left it off the hook  
Just to hear it ring  
You told me you were better off alone  
I never knew that tears could stain  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all the cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach you is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
The city seems so old and grey and beat  
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate  
And you just live across the street  
But that's a billion miles away  
  
You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place  
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'  
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are  
But I'm right in your backyard  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus  
I might as well be on mars  
You can't see me  
I might as well be the man on the moon  
You can't hear me  
Oh, can you feel me so close  
And yet so far  
Baby, I might as well be on mars  
  
Baby, I can't fly  
If I could I'd come down to ya  
Maybe I should try  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all lthe cars

A tiny prayer cracks the dark with light,  
And I here sounds behind my wall.  
Inside, a still small voice, it calls and calls.  
Then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:  
My God!  
  
When life becomes more real than children's games,  
Or we've become too old to play them,  
We'll grow old gracefully,  
We'll hide our shame.  
But there's that voice behind the wall.  
And like my conscience, it is still and small.  
Each word is mercy, protects us all:  
My God!

""Deu domine""  
""Et in pax aeternus""

And fell so low, no one could see me,  
Save for the eyes of Him that sees my crime.  
When sheep, like me, have drifted lost,  
All frightened children who are tempest tossed,  
Down flies His wrath like an albatross:

Not because of any talent but because I was the  
only one the suit would fit  
Everybody shopping, little sticky kids were hopping  
on my lap with their fingers in my beard  
I guess they thought that I was really it  
  
She sat down on my lap and said to me  
""I'm twenty three and I need someone  
You look like someone who could play with me  
Stay with me, all day with me""

and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear  
I never heard such profanity  
  
I dropped my suit on the floor  
they were trying to block the door  
They were calling her a whore  
They were driven to nativities insanity  
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze

She said, ""I hope you understand  
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""

Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities  
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes  
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality  
  
She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me  
It's warmer here by the fire""

Here's some mud made of blood and these teeth are decayed

There are ribs on the fire place mixed with the wood  
There are forces in the air, ghosts in the wind  
Some bullets in the back and some scars on the skin

Killing everything that breathed, they're an inhuman race  
There are holes in the walls, bloody hair on the bricks

Still the only one  
Only guarantee

It tells me.  
  
Am I a fool for hanging long?  
Would I be a fool for being long gone.  
When is daylight gonna dawn,  
On my crazy faith.  
  
The questions will not let me sleep,  
The dance is buried way too deep.  
But the bottom lover, lover's keep,  
Made by crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:  
It tells me.  
  
Love you're losin', those you love,  
Let the hope fly from the glove.  
Do not search the skies above.  
Search your crazy faith.  
  
Love is lightning, love is ice.  
It only strikes the lucky twice.  
Once or you will know the price.  
And once for crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.

With empty arms to hold when I need you

Shade is dark  
Cool and languid for life or long  
Safe in shadow,  
It's never as dark as the daylight  
As the daylight  
  
When I was just knee high  
My momma told me never try to be  
Someone that I am not  
Yet over time I had forgot  
A wandering child, so lost at play  
He's found himself,  
But he can't find his way  
In the daylight, oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight  
  
Life is short  
And there's no turning back the time  
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb  
In that daylight  
  
In my mind  
There's a corner I need to turn  
Lessons left is a lesson learned  
In the daylight  
In the daylight  
  
I miss the forest shade  
That took me there  
The promise I made  
Can never leave the dark so dear  
Safe and soothing yet I fear  
As I recall and I reflect  
I see it's safer to connect  
To the daylight  
Oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight

And I'm lost in the big parade  
Hold my hand darling, I'm afraid  
Of the daylight, of the day ...

And neither wants to be the one who's left to cry  
But in our secret heart of hearts we both know  
That the time for patching up has passed and it's time to go

I won't dodge the angry words that hide a broken heart

Alison Krauss,Jacob's Dream,/a/alison+krauss/jacobs+dream_20597874.html,"In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground  
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town  
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind  
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side  
  
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead  
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread  
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside  
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?  
The day is almost over, soon it will be night  
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore  
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door  
  
Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream  
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream  
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log  
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek  
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east  
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene  
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry

So hold me, whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn who we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
  
From the dim light in the greyness, the aim of the soul tends to miss  
Then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitch  
We're made for the moments like this  
  
So hold me, whisper gently that there's nothing to fear  
You'll always be near, to remind me, to stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up  
  
It's in our power to face the storm with all its fury and madness  
The flash of thunder will be harnessed with the longing and sadness  
The clouds will grey.  
  
Hold me. Whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn how we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
Hold me. Whisper gently that there's nothing to fear,  
You'll always be near, to remind me, stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up.

In the evening, momma cried

Year: 2003  
  
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire,  
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down,  
No cutlass pull will mark thy face,  
And you will be my ain true love.  
And you will be my ain true love .  
  
And as you walk through death's dark vale,  
The cannon's thunder can't prevail,  
And those who hunt thee down will fail,  
And you will be my ain true love.  
And you will be my ain true love.  
  
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth,  
The captain cries, Here comes the rout,  
They'll seek to find me north and south,  
I've gone to find my ain true love.  
  
The field is cut and bleeds too red,  
The cannon balls fly 'round my head,  
The infirmary man may count me dead,  
When I've gone to find my ain true love.  
I've gone to find my ain true love...

Folding out a picture we blur  
'Cause here in the end  
I'm losing a friend  
Fighting back a tear when it burns  
Dividing up the pieces that we were  
  
Save your breath  
You know we've both  
Tried our best  
But it's leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone  
  
I can't say you're all alone  
I'm accepting what I own  
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage  
  
I'm unable to restrain  
When the wake that we became  
Is drawing me under  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on

I hear the music up above my head  
Though the side of my heart has left me again

Secrets are written in the sky  
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found  
Though the sound of hope has left me again  
I hear music up above  
  
Standing in my broken heart all night long  
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost  
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross  
The finders love  
I know I loved you too much  
Ill go alone to get through  
  
I hear Rosetta singing in the night  
Echo's of lighting shine like stars after there gone  
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon  
With the music up above

To a sound like the sun going down  
And the magic the morning is bringing home  
A song for a life I have found  
It keeps my feet on the ground

And far to many stars have fell on me

Harder ev'ry night to sleep

If I lose your love I know that I can call it back someday  
Rambler, lonely rambler, just 'cause anyplace is home  
Nashville, lights how you have always shined  
  
Wishing now that you had found a word or two to say  
But the mornin' came and we both knew my eyes gave it away  
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye I thought only time will tell  
And you can't draw water from an empty well  
  
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone  
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long  
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice  
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice

There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all

What's being said between your heart and mine

She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget  
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time  
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind  
Until the night  
  
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger  
And finally drank away her memory  
Life is short, but this time it was bigger  
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees  
We found him with his face down in the pillow  
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'  
And when we buried him beneath the willow  
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby  
  
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself  
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath  
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time  
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind  
Until the night  
  
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger

The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing  
I long for the days you loved me only  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new  
Young hearts so tender in their yearning  
But seasons, change and lovers too  
And winter's twice as cold  
But the fire in one heart is always burning  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain  
And what was love is just a spell that's broken  
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do  
Seems our hearts have never really spoken  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart

With the world and the steel,  
The flesh and the bone.  
River keeps flowing and the grass still grows,  
And the spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Poets they come and the poets they go,  
Politicians and preachers they all claim to know.  
The words that are written and the melody's played,  
As the years turn their pages, they all start to fade.  
The oceans still move with the moon and the sky,  
The grass still grows on the hillside.  
Got to believe in believing,  
Got to believe in a dream,  
Freedom is ever deceiving,  
Never turning out to be what it seems.  
It's amazing how fast our lives go by,  
Like the flash of the lightning or the blink of an eye.  
We all fall in love, and we fall into life,  
We look for the truth on the edge of a knife.  
Heavens turn around the river still flows,  
Spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Words that are written and melody's played,

For both our oars, with little skill, by little arms are plied  
While little hands make vain pretence our wanderings to guide  
Ah, cruel three! in such an hour beneath such dreamy wheather  
To beg a tale of breath too weak to stir the tiniest feather  
And what can one poor voice avail against three tongues together  
Anon, to sudden silence won, in fancy they pursue  
The dream child moving through a land of wonders wild and new  
  
In friendly chat with bird or beast- and half believe it true  
And ever as the story drained the wells of fancy dry and faintly strove that
weary one to put the subject by  
The next time. it is next time the happy voices cry  
Thus grew the tale of wonderland, thus slowly, one by one  
It's quaint events were hammered out  
And now the tale is done and home we steer

Shame, shame on us,  
Ah little hussy,  
What did you think I was  
I look at us  
We have grown older  
A lot too much  
For me to take  
I thought  
We were immortal  
I'm so sorry  
I couldn't keep my promise  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
  
It seems to me  
That we are changing  
There ain't no limit to imagination  
The world just turns around  
Without a care  
Sometimes I feel like crying  
And every time  
I need to touch you  
How can I ever  
Break the distance  
That's why my love  
Became so strong and pure  
That's why I keep on  
Trying forever  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
For you  
Some superhero-being  
Waiting  
Under the light of the moon  
For you  
I'm coming soon.

Alphaville,Change The World,/a/alphaville/change+the+world_20006888.html,"We can change the world...  
The difference is in the way...  
The difference is in the way we are as people  
The difference is the sum of what we are  
So look at the things that join us together  
And take away the things that pull us apart  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
The light that draws us through the tunnel of perception  
Is brighter than the light  
That makes us shield our eyes  
Just believe in the idea and it's purity  
No need to question it's source,  
No need for lies  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
We can change...  
Changes...  
The magnetism  
That you feel inside  
Draws you closer  
To the heart of the matter  
And the wisdom  
That you see outside  
Is only a mattter  
Of learning  
And forgetting  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...

Alphaville,Control,/a/alphaville/control_20006865.html,"Pretty baby, don't you know, times they are a changin'  
Every little moment we grow up we lose control  
Life's a loaded gun with no directions  
And it keeps you on the run, it has no mercy  
Mum and daddy went to war  
Never coming back no more

Maybe someone dropped a bomb  
Just right into the middle of your soul-they're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
No more control again  
You're getting whole again  
Ain't no control again  
You got to get out of control  
  
Twentieth century honey bee  
What you're doing is what you'll be  
Life's no dress rehearsal when you bring the honey in  
Everything seems wrong to thee  
Tortured from the poison of reality that has no mercy  
All your friends went for the thrill  
Now it's yours to grab the kill  
Did you ever think you're getting whole again  
Maybe someone send a priest  
With some religion cooking in a bowl  
They're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
What's the fucking thing about control  
Did you think you'd ever getting whole  
Just as long as there is no control  
They have no control of you at all

Are you awake or do you dream  
You're stuck inside a frozen scene

You try to speak but there's no use  
You try to wake but you can't  
You close your eyes without a chance

He who has fallen from grace to the iron grounds

And heroes fall for heroin and heaven falls for fake  
And doris' daisies burn to hell on the grand parade of lies  
In the middle of the night when the last of God has died  
And the only friend you've got is the heartbeat of the clock  
That music plays for all time, the tv light is freezing

Bored with the beguine, the samba isn't your scene

telling the truth by making a big lie

it's a joke after joke after joke after joke

and nothing's really new  
and everybody's looking for clues  
and you know what to do with a clue

get ready for the show  
they're waiting and they will never go  
this night is just a go  
and it's only for show  
dig that deal and be a millionaire  
drinking cocktails in the stratosphere  
getting jetlagged with my business friends in these supersonic wonderlands  
there's a flicker on the graphic display,  
first he's smiling then he's fading away  
maybe he thinks tomorrow's just a joke

And her father has told her to go  
But her friend is nowhere to be seen  
As she walks through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause she's lived it ten times or more  
She could spit at the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on  
Sailors fighting in the dancehall  
Oh man, look at those cavemen go  
It's the freakiest show  
Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy  
Wough man, wonder if he'll ever know  
He's in the best selling show  
Is there life on Mars?  
It's on Amerika's tortured brow  
And Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow  
Now the workers have struck for fame  
Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broades  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds to my mother

An orbit full of questions, a perforated sky

America,Love And Leaving,/a/america/love+and+leaving_20665243.html,"(Gerry Beckley and Bill Mumy)  
  
Hey Slim how long's it been  
Five minutes maybe 10  
Can't wait to see you again and again  
First taste of this romance  
Hell baby I almost danced  
Caught myself close to believing  
But every time is a brand new feeling  
Lay me down in cool clear water  
For a moment I've forgot her  
Still I know where this is leading  
  
Win, lose, which we choose  
Won once and once refused  
Already burning down the fuse  
Don't wanna be building walls  
Cause everything rising falls  
It's darkness here the light's concealing  
Love it seems is too revealing  
Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm  
  
Down, down we all fall down  
Down, down we all fall down  
We all fall down, yeah we all fall down  
Let's toast to new love blooming  
It's all around and all consuming  
It's a dream you're bound to follow  
Til you find it's only hollow  
I can hear the angels grieving  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm

Laughing past pleasures warm by the fire

Silver vase, take a drink flower petal  
Whistling songs like steam from the kettle  
Carry silence like driftwood that rides  
On the tide, on the tide, on the tide  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Then the night will fall  
Bringing peace to all  
Darkness there together  
Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain  
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire  
Come inside  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Red river runs here beside us  
Grey morning will never divide us

Til it raced up around us  
And proceeded to shine  
Like the moonlight  
Full of reckless abandon

And food on the table  
We were doing quite well  
At such an early stage

It's all you need, you don't need any more  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Now the sun is rising out of the ocean  
Diesel trucks are flying by on the shore  
Yes that's your spirit inside you just waiting  
It's time to move, now that much you must know  
Step outside and take a breath of the morning (step outside the door)  
And the wind will tell you which way to go  
You are the needle on the compass for certain  
The missing map has come back to your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night (waking up the night)  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Albuquerque will be there in the morning  
Purple mountains will rise up from the floor  
After that you can just lift up that curtain  
And the whole world will be there at your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night (waking up the night)  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Barking in the canyon waking up the night  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Those wheels are turning once again

When I cry within 'cause I need a friend  
But I just don't say You know that I need You.  
All at once it's clear, even though You're here  
I've tried to make it on my own. I'm not trusting You.  
Lord, you know that I really need our time together.  
Only your strength can see me through  
So talk with me now As You walk with me now in this quiet time

Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,  
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,  
And running to his people before the break of day,  
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:  
  
Angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.  
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.  
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.  
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.  
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight  
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.  
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angles watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,

The scent he left behind  
But it haunts her mind  
  
You see, she's his little rag  
Nothing more than just a waif  
And he's mopping up his need  
She is tired and afraid  
Maybe she'll find a way  
Through these awful years  
To disappear  
  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
I see no mercy, and no one down here's naming names  
Nobody's naming names  
  
Now, she's looking in the mirror  
At a lovely woman face  
No more frightened little girl  
Like she's gone without a trace  
Still she leaves the light  
Burning in the hall  
It's hard to sleep at all  
  
'Til she crawls up in her bed  
Acting quiet as a mouse  
Deep inside, she's listening  
For a creaking in the house  
But no one's left to harm her  
She's fin'ly safe and sound  
There's a peace she has found  
  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  
She's coming to life again  
  
He's in the middle of her pain, in the middle of her shame  
Mercy brings life  
He's in the middle  
Mercy in the middle

Ask me how I know  
  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven

I know a man who could paint the town red  
Had a college degree in fun  
'till the doorbell rang and a long lost flame said  
""this little boy is your son""  
Gave him a suitcase and a bear  
Left 'em in a cloud of dust  
Now he's checking out schools and driving carpools  
Learning to adjust  
He says life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Well, I know that it can be demanding  
I know that it can be unkind  
I don't really understand it  
But lord sure knows I try  
Life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Let me tell you 'bout a kid I knew  
A pudgy girl back in school  
She had greasy hair and geeky glasses  
Object of ridicule  
The other day in the check out line  
They were ringing up my rice and beans  
There she was, a pretty little face  
On the cover of a magazine  
And I said life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
(chorus)  
  
Just goes to show that you never know  
Just what tomorrow may bring  
But I'll tell you this that what it is  
Is seldom what it seems  
'cause life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing. . .

When I start to sing the blues  
You pull out my dancing shoes  
I think you could be so good for me  
You get brave when I get shy  
Just another reason why  
I think you could be so good for me  
So good.  
  
Could be so good for me  
You could be so good

I'm not a child but my heart still can dream.  
  
So here's my lifelong wish,  
My grown-up Christmas list,  
Not for myself, but for a world in need:  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
And everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:  
This is my grown-up Christmas list.  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath our tree.  
Well, heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a hurting human soul.  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
Everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:

Amy Grant,I Don't Know Why,/a/amy+grant/i+dont+know+why_10010187.html,"This is one of those moments  
When all that really matters  
Is crystal clear  
  
We are woven together  
By whatever threads of life that have  
Brought us here  
  
We are stripped of all our layers  
We are getting to the core  
Tell me something real  
And nothing more  
  
'cause I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
So I'm here between the bookends  
Of everything that was and What will be  
  
There's a wealth of every nation  
Not so many answers  
It seems to me  
  
So I face the unfamiliar  
And nothing's clear  
Only blinding faith can carry me can carry me from here  
  
And I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
Hold my hand and hold this moment  
Time sure feels precious don't it  
Life is always changing  
This I know  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is now  
Baby all I know is now

Amy Grant,I Know Better Now,/a/amy+grant/i+know+better+now_20007622.html,"Some people always know the right thing to say  
I don't really think I was born that way  
And with the gift of charm, they're well endowed  
I love to watch them float right through a crowd  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
One day I met a man who showed me love  
There standing on His head was a snow white dove  
And He said,""Once I came down to this mire for you  
But I'm the Son of God, He's your Father too""  
It wasn't long before my new walk began  
Since I found Jesus, my life is in His hands  
Now I have life, no one can take it from me  
And I've a home above I'm waiting to see  
There're many rooms in the House of the Lord  
Why don't you come along and bring someone more?  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now  
I know, I know, I know  
I know better now

One more day alone again

But I have found a comfort here  
Solitude can be so dear  
Loneliness is not so blue  
When it puts my mind on you  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It makes me think of you  
(I love a lonely day)  
All alone, I can easily find your love, I love  
I love a lonely day

It chases me to you  
(I love a lonely day)  
It clears my heart  
Lets my very best part shine through, it's you  
Lonely people everywhere  
Lucky, lonely ones who care  
You've got all you need and more  
Someone to be lonely for  
Someone cries for you to hear  
Take your heart and wipe that tear  
Give them someone they can miss  
Give them love and sing them this  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It makes me think of you

All alone, I can easily find your love, I love

Of a life that you don't know and now it's scaring you?  
'Cause you're saying all the right words but no one's ever heard  
The voice that's crying out inside your heart  
Saying please don't make me die for you, I've gotta make you see  
That there's a part of me I never want to lose  
But if I have to die for you somehow let me see  
That you're more than words I need a glimpse of you  
But it's Sunday church again and the habit to pretend  
Is stronger than you knew, look how it's ruling you  
But it's friends you try to blame, oh I've done it just the same  
'Cause it's easier than answering to Him  
You think that they're playing games  
They leave and never act the same  
And you don't want a part of their show  
Yes you think there's something more  
But not inside these holy doors  
Well what are you looking for?  
Yes we have to die for Him, that's the struggle that you see?  
'Cause it's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do  
But no it's not impossible, He's been waiting so long for you  
But don't be afraid 'cause He knows the pain  
Because He had to do it for you, for you

I can't undo what's done

Did not survey the cost  
Illusions disappeared  
I've found my innocence lost  
Some say it's lessons learned  
Some say it's a living life  
I say it's choices made  
Knowing wrong from right  
One night I fought to sleep  
In my slumber I turned and tossed  
I woke to a cloudy day  
And found my innocence lost  
Innocent child is a beautiful thing  
Secure in her father's arms  
Sleeps while a mother sings  
There's no way to know  
All the harm this world can bring  
I miss my innocence  
Oh, to be innocent  
My heavenly Father  
The way of eternal love  
That overflows with grace  
I can completely trust  
My broken heart repaired  
And all my sin forgot  
I can be pure again  
In spite of my innocence lost  
In his eyes I'm a newborn child  
'cause I accept his love  
I have a newfound hope  
Though I've found my innocence lost  
I can be pure again  
I've found my innocence lost
