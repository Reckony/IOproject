But, darling, don't be blue  
  
Don't cry  
Oh, honey, please  
Don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears are in vain so, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
See it through  
You'll have me  
I'll have you

Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart

Tears in vain  
Tears, tears  
So, honey, please don't be that way

I am quite hopeless it seems, two things I know how to do  
One is to dream  
Two is loving you

And some thrills I can't define

Into heaven I'm hurled

Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

The lovely loving, and the hateful hates  
The conversation, with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again

I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were  
In love again  
  
The furtive sigh, the blackened eye  
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""  
The self deception, that believes the lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals, it soon reveals  
The faint aroma, of performing seals  
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No, no more care, no, no despair  
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

The classic battle, of a him and her  
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were

Letting darkness grow

I need a helping hand  
Just to beat the void  
I need a mission  
A dream to stop me talking to myself  
  
And now the silence is broken  
And my soul is to sell  
I need to pick up the pieces  
To scatter to the wind  
Hold the city to your ears  
You can hear the wind come in

I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do

Heart beating for you, however you lose  
So speak to me  
Believe, believe, believe me  
  
Don't let it slip, through your fingertips  
When there's a ghost  
Don't try to reason with it  
Because now I'm tired  
I'm wired  
So I won't miss a think  
I rope my words out to dry  
And I've forgotten what to sing

I'm feeling mamba fight  
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice  
You gave me what I needed, and I gave her everything she wanted

If four women from Venus, then I guess I really got a rocket  
You've got a nose around my neck, but I'm still hanging on  
We've nearly reached the finish line, I bet we're having fun

Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous

You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos

So full of energy, nothing to hide  
No need to sleep, we come alive

Being called into the heat  
Even if it's burning me

Guarding our country from traitors and new trends,  
You are at the borders,  
I am at the beaches examining exactly what the enemy teaches,  
Like presidents and pilots,  
We turned our blind eye to letters over our heads, floating in the sky,  
Thousands of paper animals signalling danger,  
They are evolving, and the world's a stranger,  
  
No currency to drive us crazy,  
No vehicles would drive us and make us lazy,  
To make us lazy,  
Only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,  
And I can't go back without a counter attack, and I can't turn around,  
It's my mother's pride,  
  
So close to somewhere else but we're not going there,  
We scan the forest floors,  
Looking worse for wear,  
For life outside of ours,  
Because we are too shallow and too brave to hide our scars and step in  
One's shadow,  
I am protective over you and the stories we enact,  
Gain what from the smallest of contact,  
  
No currency to drive us crazy,  
No vehicles to drive us and make us lazy, to make us lazy,  
Only time I fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,  
And when I see her, when I see her... Everyday,  
  
Only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear, and  
When I see her, when I see her everyday.

Years of too much thought and time I wasted  
And in each line upon my face  
Is proof I fought and lived another day  
  
When did life become this place of madness?  
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?  
I make believe I'm in control  
And dream it wasn't all my fault  
  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
When your voice won't make a sound  
Here, it's safe, in this place, up off the clouds  
  
When your feet don't touch the earth  
You can't feel the fates that hurt  
And you're free, there's no need to come down  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
  
Everyday just feels a little longer  
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?  
Running around pretending life's a play  
It doesn't make the darkness go away  
  
I may be young but I can still remember  
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter  
Now all my tears are all cried out  
Make-believe, but count me out  
  
Cause my feet are on the ground  
And the inner voice I found  
Tells the truth, ""There's no use  
If your head's in the clouds""  
  
With my feet on solid earth  
I can face the fates that hurt  
And in time, I'll be fine  
I'll come 'round  
  
I was once like you  
Life was a maze  
I couldn't find my way out  
But what I say is true  
You will be amazed  
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true  
  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
When your voice won't make a sound  
Here, it's safe. In this place  
Up off the clouds  
When your feet don't touch the earth

Elton John,Amazes Me,/e/elton+john/amazes+me_20046609.html,"You're a cool little one  
My dark southern breeze  
Sweeps through my fingers  
And it amazes me  
  
Dixie shadowland  
Your envy shelters me  
Lay down your burden  
Mystery of ebony  
  
And it amazes me  
Oh it amazes me  
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune  
It amazes me  
It amazes me  
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon  
  
Look up that pale light  
Well she's waking the trees  
I'm drifting in your hoodoo  
And it amazes me  
  
That magnolia state  
Got a hold on me  
I got no blues to preach  
Just Mississippi company  
  
Ain't no magic potion  
No gri-gri on her side  
She's bound to my salvation  
Sweet little mama  
Take me down by the river tonight  
And it amazes me

Elton John,American Triangle,/e/elton+john/american+triangle_20046635.html,"Seen him playing in his backyard  
Young boy just starting out  
So much history in this landscape  
So much confusion, so much doubt  
  
Been there drinking on that front porch  
Angry kids, mean and dumb  
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline  
God hates fags where we come from  
  
'Western skies' don't make it right  
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense  
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire  
Left to die on a high ridge fence  
  
It's a cold, cold wind  
It's a cold, cold wind  
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming  
  
See two coyotes run down a deer  
Hate what we don't understand  
You pioneers give us your children  
But it's your blood that stains their hands  
  
Somewhere that road forks up ahead  
To ignorance and innocence  
Three lives drift on different winds  
Two lives ruined, one life spent

Elton John,Amoreena,/e/elton+john/amoreena_20046929.html,"Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
And when it rains the rain falls down  
Washing out the cattle town  
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown  
And she dreams of crystal streams  
Of days gone by when we would lean  
Laughing fit to burst upon each other  
  
I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening  
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly  
Down the bronze of your body  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin  
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open  
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley  
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey  
  
Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

Turn me inside out if you have to baby  
But don't you cross me off your list

Never been kissed by a lady called Amy  
  
You're far out, you're fab and insane  
A woman of the world, it's quite plain  
My dad told me Amy's your name  
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game  
But he can bust my neck 'cause I love you all the same  
  
Amy I know you don't have to show your affection  
Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection  
So if you don't want me around  
I think I'll run along and drown  
You can't want this bum in town Amy  
  
I'm beaten on the streets 'cause I loves you  
I watch you go to work in the summer  
I don't whistle at you down the street  
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see

Amy I may not be nineteen  
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans

Driving me insane

Dirty minds they go to town

Takes more than hocus pocus babe

Elton John,Blues Never Fade Away,/e/elton+john/blues+never+fade+away_20538325.html,"He wasn't famous but I sure did love him  
I've got his picture in a little frame  
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name  
But there's so many more and I've lost count  
The how's and whys aren't important now  
All that matters is they came around  
And brightened up our lives  
  
She was twenty one with her life ahead  
You don't need to know her name  
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade  
But fate's right hand isn't always just  
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust  
She was just a little girl ain't that enough  
To rage against the day  
  
[Chorus:]  
And how did we get so lucky?  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?  
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls  
But blues never fade away  
  
He shone so bright with a lust for life  
Like the Sun King that he was  
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth  
And for reasons I never understood  
About the choices made between the bad and good  
I've tried to figure out but  
The pain never goes away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And there's marble markers and little white crosses  
Along the beaten path  
And I've spread their ashes on the wind  
And I miss John Lennon's laugh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And how did we get so lucky?  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?  
  
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey all the colors run when the rain falls  
And blues never fade away

Down on the jive talk

Low life's complete

When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot

The temperature's up to ninety five  
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes  
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here  
So how come it's cold as christmas in the middle of the year  
  
I dreamed of love in a better climate  
And for what it's really worth  
I put faith in the star we followed  
To this caribbean surf

And I cannot find the lines

But the years went by and the rock just died  
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy  
Long nights crying by the record machine  
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans  
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got  
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock  
Learning fast as the weeks went past  
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last  
  
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking  
When your feet just can't keep still  
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will  
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights  
When Suzie wore her dresses tight  
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  
  
La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la  
  
I remember when rock was young  
Me and Suzie had so much fun  
Holding hands and skimming stones  
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own  
But the biggest kick I ever got  
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock  
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock  
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock  
  
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking  
When your feet just can't keep still  
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will  
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights

Elton John,Cry To Heaven,/e/elton+john/cry+to+heaven_20046450.html,"I found a black beret on the street today  
It was lying in the gutter all torn  
There's a white flag flying on a tall building  
But the kids just watch the storm  
  
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows  
Shattered glass before their eyes  
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway  
Where the sniper sleeps at night  
  
No birthday songs to sing again  
Just bricks and stones to give them  
Wrap them up in your father's flags  
And let them cry to heaven  
  
There are many graves by a cold lake  
As the beds were when your babies are born  
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin  
But the kids just watch the storm  
  
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse  
Until he killed it with his claws  
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing  
Before they go to war

Elton John,Curtains,/e/elton+john/curtains_20046451.html,"I used to know this old scarecrow  
He was my song  
My joy and sorrow,  
Cast alone between the furrows  
Of a field no longer sown by anyone.  
I held a dandelion  
That said the time had come  
To leave upon the wind  
Not to return  
When summer burned the earth again.  
  
Cultivate the freshest flower  
This garden ever grew,  
Beneath these branches  
I once wrote such childish words for you.  
But that's okay,  
There's treasure children always seek to find,  
And just like us  
You must have had  
A once a upon a time.

In my heart lies a memory  
To tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me, my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
  
Though I tried to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul  
So take me out of my world  
Let me try to go on living  
Right now

I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
  
Too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when I met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

But see me once and see the way I feel  
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm  
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal

Look out dreamboat here I come

When each emotion pinball in your mind  
  
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile  
I was the judge and jury at your trial  
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn  
Now I have the time to stand and learn  
  
But you and I have come so far  
With a shaken faith  
From the pain of a broken heart  
Toward feeling great  
Feel like life has just begun  
No more singing duets for one  
  
I hold your picture here beside the bed  
You had a party raging in your head  
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt  
And here today all I can do is learn

Falling under someone's wheels

Better off to face the facts  
When love holds you up for ransom  
Walk away and don't look back  
  
Never seen you looking back through  
Smiling eyes and tears  
Never knew you holding on to  
Memories and fears  
  
Just release me i can't take it  
Can't you see a change has come  
Strangled by infatuation  
Buried under someone's thumb  
  
It's easier to walk away  
Cover and fade to black  
When love scars and leaves you branded  
Walk away and don't look back

To beg for help  
But I won't even try  
  
I want nothing in the world  
But myself to protect me  
But I won't lie down  
Roll over and die  
  
All I have to do is  
To forget how much I love him  
All I have to do is  
Put my longing to one side  
  
Tell myself that  
Love's an ever changing situation  
Passion would have cooled  
And all the magic would have died  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last saw him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Tender in his manner  
And my self-consolation  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, easy as life  
  
All I have to do is  
To pretend I never knew him  
On those very rare occasions  
When he steals into my heart  
  
Better to have lost him  
When the ties were barely binding  
Better the contempt  
Of the familiar cannot start  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last touched him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Those very rare occasions don't let up  
They keep on coming  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, it's easy as life  
  
And then I see the faces  
Of a worn defeated people  
A father and a nation  
Who won't let a coward run  
  
Is this how the Gods reward  
The faithful through the ages?  
Forcing us to prove that  
All the hardest things we've done  
  
Are easy, so easy  
  
And though I'll think about him  
Until the earth draws in around me  
And though I choose to leave him  
For another kind of love  
  
This is no denial, no betrayal  
But redemption  
Redeemed in my own eyes  
And in the pantheon above  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
It's easy as life

Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing  
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs  
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

And yeah I've seen your movie  
And I read it in your book  
The truth just flew off every page  
Your songs have all the hooks  
You're seven wonders rolled in one  
You shifted gear to cruise  
Oh you came to town in headlines  
And eight hundred dollar shoes  
  
Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands  
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land  
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast  
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass

Elton John,Go It Alone,/e/elton+john/go+it+alone_20046400.html,"It's so hard to say goodbye  
When there's nothing left to give  
When this house is just a hill of bones  
Where you and I once lived  
If we put it back together  
By the skin of our teeth  
You'd still pull it all apart  
Bit by bit, piece by piece  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
There's no passion alive  
When you count your phony schemes  
And the cars you drive to buy your friends  
They don't ever come back clean  
If the cards on the table  
Always turn up spades  
The cards that always cheat the hearts  
The spades you play just dug my grave  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
I'm gonna build it up again with someone new

And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring

As the sheep that he locked in the pen  
  
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn  
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm  
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare  
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there  
  
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember  
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger  
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him  
And later men came from the town  
Who said clear the child this won't take a while  
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

While you lie on a cold damp ground  
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt

With a broken sun above the clouds  
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down  
And a sign on the wall says, ""Hope Allowed""  
  
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone  
A far cry from a tattooed rose  
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind  
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder  
Will she still be the star to see me through  
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
No I can't steer my heart clear of you  
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed  
Out of a storm and into view  
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue  
You control the weather  
And I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
Make me your penance, show me your innocence  
Everything is history  
From the aching to the pleasure  
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us  
Everything gets twisted  
Let me burn or bring me water

Every thought of you I want to shout aloud  
Then I think about the love I have inside me  
How you brought what's inside out  
Now love's made it to the outside  
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found  
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me  
You turned my living upside down  
And I can't tell the bottom from the top  
Am I standing on my head or on my heels  
Is it cloudy, is it bright  
Is it day or is it night  
Am I wrong or am I right  
And is it real  
Tell me where you learned the magic  
The spell you used the day you made me fall  
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion  
I'm upside down but ten feet tall  
On and on I've drifted with the tide  
I didn't know that love could move me so  
You fed my life with love and much more besides  
And you showed me which way to go

Elton John,I Cry At Night,/e/elton+john/i+cry+at+night_20047007.html,"This house that I live in has no reason  
This house that I sleep in has no purpose  
It has a bed and a few old chairs  
Three flights up, two flights of stairs  
But it has no reason  
  
Then someone shot through the tire swing  
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring  
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings  
To a dying season  
  
And I cry at night when the lights go out  
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts  
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies  
And when the lights go out it's thought to survive  
  
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble  
This man that I live in bears his faults  
He has a heart and a well worn soul  
Ten years a slave to rock and roll  
But he has to tremble  
  
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn  
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn  
And just like your love that's come and gone  
It goes on breathing

This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me

This fool's suffered gladly each and every day  
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away

I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see  
For every rose you give her, I'll give you three  
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me  
Oh, I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark

Like a corn in a field I cut you down  
I threw the last punch too hard  
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time  
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards  
  
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend  
I figured we'd painted too much of this town  
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon  
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
  
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of robert ford  
I'm low as a paid assassin is  
You know I'm cold as a hired sword  
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up  
You know I can't think straight no more  
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of robert ford  
  
Like a child when his toy's been stepped on  
That's how it all seemed to me  
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in  
And I'm damned if i'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel  
  
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man  
Your friends and mine don't call no more  
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded  
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law  
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law

And it won't be long before you and me run  
To the place in our hearts where we hide

Time on my hands could be time spent with you  
Laughing like children, living like lovers  
Rolling like thunder under the covers

Picture my face in your hands

Cry in the night if it helps

More than I love life itself

Im gonna be the ruler  
Of most everything around  
From the grandest of the mountains  
To the humble common ground  
My reign will be a super awesome thing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
Im gonna be a noble king  
Unscrupulously fair  
I only need a little time  
Perhaps a little hair  
  
Im gonna be the mane event  
Like no king was before  
Im brushing up on looking down  
Im working on my roar  
The fauna and the flora gonna swing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
No one saying do this  
No one saying be there  
No one saying stop that  
No one saying see here  
Free to run around all day  
Ill be free to do it my way  
  
The time has come as someone said  
To talk of many things  
This may be true  
But I would rather stick to talking kings  
  
Its easy to be royal if you're already leonine  
It isn't just my right even my left will be divine  
The monarchy is waiting to go zing  
Oh I just can't wait to be king

And for some I found a cure

From one you learn something  
Another you learn, nothing  
And there's one who might teach you everything  
But before I learned to listen  
And if indeed someone said it

Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes  
And one was just a trophy catch  
And one was like a curse  
Some would want to bleed you dry  
Some might quench your thirst

In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line  
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time  
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind

Torn from their families  
Mothers go hungry  
To feed their children  
But children go hungry  
There's so many big men  
They're out making millions  
When poverty's profits  
Just blame the children  
  
If there's a god in heaven  
What's he waiting for  
If he can't hear the children  
Then he must see the war  
But it seems to me  
That he leads his lambs  
To the slaughter house  
And not the promised land  
  
  
Dying for causes  
They don't understand  
We've been taking their futures  
Right out of their hands  
They need the handouts  
To hold back the tears  
There's so many crying  
But so few that hear  
  
  
If there's a god in heaven  
Well, what's he waiting for  
  
  
If there's a god in heaven

I got a taste of love in a simple way

Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did  
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid

Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind  
  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

You starting down the road leaving me again  
The threats you made were meant to cut me down  
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody  
She'd smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up -

A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie  
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore  
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door  
  
In neon, in neon...  
  
Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour  
Cut into fashion that flashs above 'em in neon  
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers  
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon  
  
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror  
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something  
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up -

Elton John,Indian Sunset,/e/elton+john/indian+sunset_20046511.html,"As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging  
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee  
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman  
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving  
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead  
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns  
  
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young  
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums  
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild  
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine  
  
And now you ask that I should watch  
The red man's race be slowly crushed  
What kind of words are these to hear  
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears  
  
I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child  
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride  
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons  
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run  
  
Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand  
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands  
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead  
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead  
  
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on  
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home  
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming  
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running  
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones  
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns  
  
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold  
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole

He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family  
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you  
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes

You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?  
  
Who's that sneaking 'round the door?  
You can't come here no more  
Can't you go home again?

Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that  
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers

Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul  
You should both be shut down in the coal-hole  
That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night  
And a woman who teaches wrong from right

The tight lipped leer of judgement

Then if I were to speak my mind about this house""

Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams  
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems

And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs""

Who's going to do big things

Been through their big deals and smalls

The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived  
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived  
  
And they were surprised to see us  
So they greeted us with palms  
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms  
I might recite a small prayer  
  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise  
  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial  
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye  
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme  
  
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams  
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi  
For if I hold my hand outstretched  
A little bird comes to me  
  
I might recite a small prayer

I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
  
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""  
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""  
  
And in this pit of sadness  
Where the rank of wretched plunge  
We've buried all the innocents  
Now we must bury revenge  
  
They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a
mustang  
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars
still spangle  
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine  
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to
Palestine  
  
Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces  
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces  
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance  
Though I seemed a long way from my home  
  
It really was no distance  
And I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
  
Found myself in bedlam  
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause  
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors  
And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause  
Wailing echoes down the corridors

Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault  
Just like the canals of mars and the great barrier reef

She said that she was working for the ABC News  
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use  
Her perfume was unspeakable  
It lingered in the air  
Like her artificial laughter  
Her mementos of affairs  
""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him""  
""Isn't that very fortunate for you""  
And she showed me his calling card  
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two  
He was a fine idea at the time  
Now he's a brilliant mistake  
  
He thought he was the King of America  
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams  
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals  
The words of love in whispers  
And the acts of love in screams  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
I was a fine idea at the time  
Now I'm a brilliant mistake

The blue light of a votive  
  
Rain obscured the window  
As the pain was dulled by the grains  
Absolved by spoons in flames  
In fear in time dissolving  
  
It's not for the faint of pulse  
Or anybody false  
Those amateurs who simply shed their skins  
So where are those traitors now, we once called patriots?  
Just like those saints who seem to revel in their sins  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassin's work was done  
But bells in hands are only there for the wringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king  
  
Trumpet sounds lamenting  
Trampling down the blooms of the deceased  
The double agent girl and the fallen priest were heading for the border  
  
Somewhere in the high command there stayed the palest hand  
Who saw the order countermand  
Erased the tape recorder and then they hung him from a window cord  
  
Swallow down that voodoo vial and stay your breath a while  
Before we spill this tale that we had spun  
And now I shall now confide all that I have denied  
Oh I'm so sorry for the things I've done

To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon  
Tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan  
This stolen feeling  
Amplified up through a busted speaker  
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason  
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,

The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide  
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride  
The timepiece stretched across a wrist

The scent that so repelled him that he swore: ""insecticide""  
And there's a farewell note to mother  
That will conclude ""Your loving Son""  
""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done.""

So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees  
And names the painting ""Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory""

Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense  
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls  
With puckered lips  
She's a trophy on your arm  
A magnet for your money clip

They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away

And the man of the moment is the lifer at large

If you've got something to hide, if you've got something to sell  
If you've got somebody's pride she might kiss and tell  
Or wind up with a fight fan in the Hammersmith Hotel  
You better speak up now if you want your piece  
You better speak up now  
It won't mean a thing later  
Yesterday's news is tomorrow's fish and chip paper  
  
Your girl says she's leaving and this time she really means it  
You can just look at the pictures, you don't actually have to read it  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
There's a man in the launderette and he's looking through your underwear  
For clues  
And the milkman is working through the News of the Screws  
  
He says...

Walking around looking like a figment of somebody else's imagination  
Taking ev'ry word she says just like an open invitation

From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream

Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Hey  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying  
If they keep on drinking then they'll end up staying  
I heard someone say where have we met before  
But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But don't get me wrong  
Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long

I got two eyes that happened by ya,  
And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.  
I got two lips that long to kiss you,  
And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating  
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.  
You better watch out 'cause of what I say  
Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground, sweet baby.

Elvis Costello,Georgia And Her Rival,/e/elvis+costello/georgia+and+her+rival_20811860.html,"Georgie grew to hate her name  
It sounded like a tiny man  
And the one she had said, ""I can't see you  
But I'll call you whenever I can""  
  
Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep  
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions  
Though she often felt cheated  
She never felt cheap  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
It was half-past February  
And he hadn't called since New Year's Day  
Maybe he'd found another woman  
To say those words no chapel girl should say  
  
Her mother would phone and always keep her talking  
She'd try to be polite, making faces  
But somewhere in the back of her mind  
Her rival was stalking  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Her rival would always wait  
'Til the eighth or ninth bell  
He'd be desperate anyway  
And drunk as well  
  
She always liked to hurt him  
To prove he was prepared  
To love her anyway that she wanted  
So she could tell which she preferred  
  
He sat up with his address book  
Trying to think what mood he's in  
His finger traced past Georgie's name  
To someone who needed less persuading  
  
He didn't hear through her disguise  
He didn't leave her in a rush  
Just like the promise that he left  
On her machine that almost made her blush  
  
The radio plays a lover's symphony  
The number you have dialed has been re-directed  
Now she puts him on the speaker-phone  
Whenever she has company  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival

Georgie and her rival

Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely, not the right amount

Elvis Costello,King Horse,/e/elvis+costello/king+horse_20047298.html,"Cheap cut satin and bad perfume  
Showtime is almost here  
Teased up by a strip cartoon  
Laughing up your sleeve  
Sniggering in your beer  
He'd seen the bottom of a lot of glasses  
But he'd never seen love so near  
He'd seen love get so expensive  
But he'd never seen love get so dear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I know that you're all King Horse  
Between tenderness and brute force (repeat)  
  
She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set  
Hit the bill, ring the bell, never spill a sip  
And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get  
A lot of loose exchanges, precious little respect  
When it's someone else's weekend  
That's the best you can expect  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So fond of the fabric  
So fond of fabrication  
From comic books to tragic  
Through the heart of complications  
Meanwhile back in some secluded spot  
He says 'will you please?' and she says 'stop'  
If I ever lose this good thing that I've got  
I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight  
'Cause I knew that song so long before we met  
That it means much more than it might

She broke my little heart in two  
Now somebody else is being the same old you

Because you're so lovable  
Put your money where your mouth was  
You're so lovable  
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam  
You're so lovable  
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom  
You're so lovable  
  
You're so sweet  
You're so honest  
You say 'I'll be true to you boy'  
But I won't promise

Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said daddy, o, don't you dare  
He gives me fever with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses,  
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Cats were born to give chicks fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
We give you fever when we kiss you  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

And your family in it (Ah!)  
God dammit, he meant it when he told you!

Attention all units, attention all units  
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair  
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair  
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife  
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
Verse 1]  
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm  
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair  
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there  
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes  
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks  
  
[Chorus]  
I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he ain't no good!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed  
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post  
And most of all be advised that he's wise  
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys  
  
[Chorus]  
I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he ain't no good!  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally  
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
It's sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya""  
  
[Chorus]  
I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he ain't no good!  
  
[Verse 4]  
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place? went!  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume  
  
[Chorus]  
I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he ain't no good!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned  
They're only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone  
  
[Police voice]  
Attention all cars, attention all cars  
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect  
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat  
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?  
  
[Chorus: x 3]  
I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

How can I describe, the way I feel?  
Fuckin great man! Okay, let me see  
How could I begin  
  
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch,  
Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch,  
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,  
And to soak it up and in between snack, crackers to munch,  
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up,  
All I asked for was a glass of punch,  
You see, I never really ask for much,  
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such,  
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk,  
Weisman Gale, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up,  
I'm not playin, I want to bag ya punk,  
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk,  
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin pump,  
Zappin Eric Clapton, (Shaft?), Frank Zappa crunk,  
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya,  
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want,  
I mean I really want you bad you cunt,  
Nick you had your fun,  
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk,  
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood,  
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupunc-ture

Bagpipes from Baghdad  
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-,  
  
You can be a permanent fixture,  
In my lyrical mixture,  
I'm the miracle whit trixter,  
My sig-nature sound, when the tube of lipstick's around,  
I'm bound to put on in an instant, wow  
Man what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-  
Ceuticals, it's beautiful, pill dust in my palm, my  
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle,  
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama,  
I'll cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya,  
The size of a sword boy, I'm like a fucken Red Sonia,  
Get it stuck in your cornea,  
Nice knowin ya Norman,  
You're so fuckin' annoyin,  
Drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck ya doin',  
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more,  
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore,  
Every minute there's a sucker born,  
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn,  
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn,  
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucken on,  
What the fuck are you doin',  
You're runnin' over the snow blower,  
With the lawnmower, blow on your  
Bagpipes from Baghdad

In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables,  
I bet you they become heterosexual,  
Nothing will stop me from molesting you,  
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle  
Flesh, tickles my testicles,  
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins,  
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend,  
You need some ointment, just make an appointment,  
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip  
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip,  
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get  
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit  
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip,  
I'm going to get the needle, new thread from the sewing kit,  
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit,  
Lured the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip

Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed  
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left  
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death  
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two  
Smackin through 'til you're black and blue for actin true

Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans

Clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em  
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts  
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts

A major risk to a plagiarist

Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers  
Hit the source to better my skills,  
I head for the border  
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours  
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse  
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage

In the range of my double-barrel  
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril

Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels  
That's how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative,  
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10

Eminem,Bully,/e/eminem/bully_10106000.html,"Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging  
  
I'm withholding my anger  
Though I'd like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck  
It's my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
That's what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He don't exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And it's destroying him slowly  
'Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now he's acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared  
  
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)  
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)  
I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no (bully)  
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)  
  
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
There's so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that I'm down with 50  
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irv's on a string  
And Irv's so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough  
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our building's made out of bricks  
So you ain't taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much (E...)  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hip-hop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta  
It's like a never-ending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard  
I'm not excluding myself  
'cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go, but then again  
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
It's no exception, it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesn't kill him  
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed  
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halie's name  
  
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)  
  
Get at me, dawg

I stand in, by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin  
Yes, I'm tired of being  
Why should I be secluded, I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell, ""Eminem will you kick it for me?""  
So I find myself in a certain?depligatory?  
A place where I dwell in, for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time,  
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile, I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
""Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?""  
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?  
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead  
There's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read,  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor  
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
""Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you tryin to do?  
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to""  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and  
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin it's accepted now it's a trend  
  
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...""  
  
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No? so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?  
  
On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But I've? apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted  
Pull up the? quick,  
These we hate him, these are past us, huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine  
But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and he's put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please  
I've got a craving

One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  
'Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We can't figure out if it's lust  
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch

You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just 'cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if there's one thing about you that I admire  
It's baby, because you stay with me  
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am  
'Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise  
You're always full of surprises  
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
You've always kept out of mine  
I wonder what's on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didn't see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral, the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do, and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter  
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable  
Is you're the legs to my table,  
If you were to break I'd fall on my face  
But I'm always gonna make you feel  
I don't need you as much as I really need you  
So you don't use it to your advantage  
But you're essential to me  
You're the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
I'd probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my Marshall  
You're the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my Eminem  
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that I'm lookin for  
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just won't come to my mind  
You're like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
You're like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough

While the world is fast asleep

Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
It's funny how I've got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I ain't got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
One day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look who's laughing  
I'm sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart

And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when I'm all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
I'm talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now it's a brand new day  
And I'll be doin it again  
It's time for the main attraction  
  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got

Yeah but I'm home.  
Bad to the bone, back in the zone  
Let him alone,

You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.  
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone, like I'm in the twilight dog

Suplexin it on cement, like I'm on some straight outta compton shit

Jackass eat a donkey dick.  
The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong  
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this
honkey shit.  
No sense screaming and arguing.  
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.  
You think you ball, well I palm it.  
I throw up bombs when I vomit.  
Boy I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet.  
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.  
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.  
Bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell I go right off the
bat.  
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head.  
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web, I'm just gonna
spin it and try to use it to my advantage.  
I catch a fly in that bitch.  
You think you fly, you just food.  
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude.  
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled,
confused as usual, and you can get ripped she can open a can too

They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Battle my own demons

Bad as I need a horn  
Stabbing my clavicle bone  
I'm at it or prone  
First time I seen a dessert eagle  
I was letting the 44 buss  
The 44 pop  
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs  
Looking at Robocop  
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain  
In order to clean my things you need saline  
I'm never refering to the solution  
I'm talking about more like the mustang  
Vroom  
Get respect from the get-go, hello  
Set to the echo, pyscho  
Pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise  
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song  
As the echo follows the Maserati  
As the petrol swallows,  
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton  
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant  
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings  
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,  
Right now I'm living a dream  
Though we may be reckless  
The ladies check us  
They whisper Shady records  
Baby echo

It's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming  
My mentality's caveman stupid woman  
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe  
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago  
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow  
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo  
Oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful  
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle  
Rhyming to the call, to the [?] all the way down to my sock and the hair on my
toe  
Learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole  
Cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first

I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire  
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her  
Cause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her  
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet

Cross the bombest

Cause I ain't making no more threats  
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,

Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador

Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Mama had a baby and its head popped off

Where does that leave me?  
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'

Do you think that I?m kidding?  
What do I look like some kinda idiot?  
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood?  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish  
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had,  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his ex-wife how they go at it man

Claims he had it, I can't imagine it

Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank

Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?  
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.  
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere  
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round  
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just don't close for me  
This ain't how fame was supposed to be  
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)  
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience  
  
That's nonsense!  
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs  
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs  
Tell her you need a place to stay  
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade  
  
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to  
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you  
Think about it before you walk in the door first  
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns  
  
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!  
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?  
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?  
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?  
  
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)  
Not over this shit (Stop!)  
Drop the biscuit (I will!)  
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you  
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)  
  
(""It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute"")  
(""Mm, I don't know!"")  
(""Look baby"")  
(""Damn!"")  
(""Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?"")  
(""Well OK"")  
  
Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (""Give me a kiss!"")  
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,  
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.  
Once again, his conscience comes into play (""Shit!"")  
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek  
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink  
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe  
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old  
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)  
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)  
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare  
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there  
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie ""Kid"")  
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!  
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)  
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail  
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.  
After coming home from a hard day's work,  
He walks in the door of his trailer park home  
To find his wife in bed with another man.  
(""What the fuck!"")  
(""Grady!"")  
  
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'  
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'  
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?  
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!  
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?  
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)  
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady  
But think about the baby before you get all crazy  
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?  
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?  
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard  
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?  
What you say? (What's wrong?  
Didn't think I'd remember?)  
I'm a kill you motherfucker!  
Uh-ah! Temper temper!  
  
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?  
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?  
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?  
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went  
Been there, done that, aw fuck it  
What am I sayin'?  
Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?

Yo, I'll fuckin, I'll  
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)  
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to  
The only key that I see to defeat you  
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you  
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe  
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse  
You'll think I pulled the fuckin' ground out from underneath you  
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin' G, I'm a cannibal  
I ain't tryin' to shoot you,  
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you  
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass  
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress  
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)  
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis  
I'm so bananas I'm showin' up to your open casket  
To fill it full of explosive gasses  
And close it back with a lit match in it  
While I sit back and just hope it catches  
Blow you to fragments  
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
I see the light at the end  
But every time I take a step, it gets dim  
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?  
If so, heaven's got to be better  
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)  
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse  
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc  
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot  
One day we all gon' die  
But when I die, I'ma be so high  
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare  
With the chalk outline still there  
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot  
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock  
Now if I pray every night (night)  
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?  
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth  
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse  
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse  
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk  
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface  
Nickel nine at my waist, God done lost faith  
Angels greet me but I don't reply back  
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Masta Ace]  
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso  
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso  
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger  
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger  
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound  
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds  
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger  
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her  
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her  
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager  
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel  
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel  
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder  
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder  
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare  
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

My name is Shaaady  
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)  
  
Yea  
  
You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?  
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth  
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house  
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?  
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse  
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out  
Nope, guess I'll re-route  
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch  
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth  
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it  
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet  
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet  
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes  
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers  
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels  
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules  
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

Yea  
  
My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium  
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em  
It just becomes everyday extracurricular  
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun  
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one  
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room  
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?  
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?  
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?  
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one  
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm  
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run  
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone  
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some  
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum  
  
Umm  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Oh, Those were the days they certainly were  
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good  
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)  
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery  
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased  
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans  
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in  
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'  
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up  
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils  
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back  
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack  
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap  
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact  
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap  
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back

Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe that's the way I should go,  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought I'd be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same

Let me read it to you, goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
I'm writing to you 'cuz I'm hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz' I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home?  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents don't care that I do this shit  
No one loves me it's like  
I'm a piece of trash  
I don't get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you don't reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
  
Eminem:  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason don't you forget that  
Pulled what's the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge?  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
It's just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all it's doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead what's the point in all this!  
  
I finally put it all together,  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine,  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase,  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe that's the way it should be,  
You know I've led my life like a gypsy  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same

Praying for sleep  
Dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grant's and Jackson's  
These transactions explain a man's actions  
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and there's a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics  
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static, children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth  
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep  
Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep

You can have corn rows inside your hair  
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare  
This bottle of wine goes upside your head  
A little bit psycho, but I know that  
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it  
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag  
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad  
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit  
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads  
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah  
See me, but don't dare to try no shit  
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers  
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass  
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast  
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad  
From outta nowhere, you might find your career  
Come to it, and I was like (Oh Yeah)

If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice  
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight  
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit  
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it  
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit  
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it  
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'Go get 'em'  
And I'm just like 'Why your tryin' to fight momentum?'  
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm  
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim  
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire  
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''  
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah  
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars  
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her

A beautiful day, without drama is rare

Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip?  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti  
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'  
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out  
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now  
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!  
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity  
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked  
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes  
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke  
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's
when its  
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment  
You own it, you better never let it go  
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order  
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to  
Five and I can't provide the right type of  
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers  
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna,  
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not  
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

A riot is emerging, men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify

But that's alright, because I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe  
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

Now you're in each others face,  
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em  
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,  
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em  
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both  
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,  
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over, it's a different day  
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her  
Next time you'll show restraint  
You don't get another chance,  
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave,

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,  
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time, there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know it's lies  
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie

Hello  
Can I speak to Maxine?  
Yeah this is me what's up?  
What up?  
  
Who dis?  
Denaun  
Yeah what's up?  
What are you doing?  
  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Huh?  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Why?  
  
I don't know thinking about something freaky to do  
  
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine  
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean  
Plus she got a sugar daddy  
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation  
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation  
When you step away son, she got her face done  
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)  
  
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is  
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit  
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this  
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..  
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said ""Oh it's like that?""  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck  
I said ""Maxine check this out,  
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing?""  
  
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""  
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""  
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""  
I got up out  
  
Hey, Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick?  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price? What you mean?  
You know, money nigga  
You don't need no damn money,  
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.  
  
What you, what you hear I got?  
AIDS  
Who told you that bullshit?  
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie  
  
Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then  
Oh for real, it's like that?  
Well I ain't got shit,  
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,  
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga  
  
Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you  
No, see..  
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you  
Hold on, why it ain't even like that  
  
I want ya'll to get paid, fucking

For me to raise such a stink up  
When motherfuckers hate your guts  
You ain't even gotta say much  
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers  
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush  
I can't explain what it is my brain does  
But however it works its insane  
Its plain nutz  
And it ain't just my brain thas dangerous  
Its a whole combination of things  
It takes nutz  
And I'm not affriad to raise the stakes up  
I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks  
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us  
I'm patiently waiting for the day  
I'm anxious  
To see the look on ya fake mugs  
When you thugs go bankrupt  
Ya drunk  
Ya ain't tough  
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas  
This is me talking motherfucker  
This ain't drugs  
You wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up  
FUCK THAT  
Its too late chump now face up  
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause I've always came off  
Like ja's chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I don't stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I don't gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause I've been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since 8 mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls  
Trust me

""Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate""  
""All I see is blood and murder, my mind state""  
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!  
  
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span  
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'  
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'  
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
'Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin' the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' ""Freeze!""  
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots, they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out  
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out  
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,  
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up  
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up  
Stole her car, made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on ""Set it Off"" did  
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal  
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though  
Parents screamin', ""Son, go in and call the police  
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""truce truce!""  
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasn't me!  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Are you sleepy? Take a nap  
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep  
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street  
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)  
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)  
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)  
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)  
  
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around  
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds  
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out  
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?  
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked  
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,  
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in  
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'  
The mortician of love, sent from above,  
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become  
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb  
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder  
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha  
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her  
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera  
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row,  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,  
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in,  
And how they attacked the victim,  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,  
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,  
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

He can give her some, she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

You stare into your stereos eyes

'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,

I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,  
And kicked and hit with shit every time

And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids

That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out  
She said (Help me I think I am having a seizure)  
I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my t-shirt (Let go)  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me  
She said (I am 26 years old and I am not married I don't even have any  
Kids and I can't cook)  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Susie where you going you better be careful  
(leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled)  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum?  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please?  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John where's Dave at before I bash you  
He's in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And there's only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off?  
Well it depends on how may you've had  
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps  
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol (She is going to die dude)  
I know and its my fault (My god)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I am so sorry I am so sorry  
Susie please wake up  
What are you doing  
Your not dead

Emmylou Harris,A River For Him,/e/emmylou+harris/a+river+for+him_20050040.html,"I crossed on the river  
There'll be no returning  
I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now I'm a stranger  
To a strange land I'm driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
And the name I'm calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So sweep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him

Gather up a heavy load  
Ain't gonna heed his call  
Ain't givin' him the time of day

Heading down the straight and true

Into the yonder blue

Out upon the icy turn  
In a foggy situation  
Squealin' on a hairpin curve

Tonight my bag is packed  
Tommorrow I'll walk these tracks  
That will lead me across the border  
Tommorrow my love and I  
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies  
Somewhere across the border  
  
We'll leave behind my dear  
The pain and sadness we found here  
And we'll drink from the Brazos muddy waters  
Where the sky grows gray and wide  
We'll meet on the other side  
There across the border  
  
For me you'll build a house  
High up on a grassy hill  
Somewhere across the border  
Where pain and memory  
Pain and memory have been stilled  
There across the border  
  
And sweet blossoms fill the air  
Pastures of gold and green  
Roll down into cool clear waters  
And in your arms 'neath the open skies  
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes  
There across the border  
  
Tonight we'll sing the songs  
I'll dream of you my Corazon  
And tommorrow my heart will be strong  
And may the saints blessing and grace  
Carry me safely into your arms  
There across the border  
  
For what are we  
Without hope in our hearts  
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters  
And eat the fruit from the vine  
I know love and fortune will be mine  
Somewhere across the border

Clocked up beneath the clouds  
They're counting down to show time  
When we do it for real with the crowds  
Air miles are owing  
But they don't come for free  
And they don't give you any for pain  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
The rimshots come down like cannon fire  
And thunder off the wall  
There's a man in every corner  
And each one is giving his all  
  
This is my fife  
This is my drum  
So you never will hear me complain  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain

Well if you're inclined  
To go up on the wall  
It can only be fast and high  
And those who don't like the danger  
Soon find something different to try  
When there's only a ringin' in your ears  
And an echo down memory lane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
  
The show's packing up  
I sit and watch the convoy  
Leaving town  
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,  
For riding around and around  
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death  
You showed me one time on the plane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
A million miles of vagabond sky  
Clocked up above the clouds  
I'm still your man for the roaming  
For as long as there's roamin' allowed  
  
There'll be a rider  
And there'll be a wall  
As long as the dreamer remains  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain

Raised with a proud but a wandering heart  
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation  
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations  
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes  
With bugs on her headlights  
And runs in her hose  
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose  
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose  
They've got a national monument carved out of stone  
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed  
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose  
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose  
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour  
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor  
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power

Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away  
She'll walk 'til she finds him her darlin' her stray  
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash  
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss  
  
And there's nothin' to follow nowhere to go  
He's gone like the summer gone like the snow  
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song  
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong  
  
Did she dream was it he who went galloping past  
And bent down the fern broke open the grass  
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe  
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth  
  
And although he goes grazin' a minute away  
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day  
And she's blind to his presence except to compare  
Her injury here with his punishment there  
  
Then at home on a branch on a highest tree  
A songbird sings out so suddenly  
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride  
On a willow tree by the riverside  
  
Ah the world is sweet and world is wide  
He's there where the light and the darkness divide  
And the steam's comin' off him he's huge and he's shy  
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky  
  
And he comes to her hand but he's not really tame  
He longs to be lost she longs for the same  
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge thru the first open pass  
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass  
  
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau  
Where there's nothing above and nothing below  
It's time for their burden the whip and the spur  
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her  
  
So she binds herself to her galloping steed  
And he binds himself to the woman in need  
And there is no space just left and right  
And there is no time but there is day and night  
  
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low  
Whither thou goest I will go  
And they turn as one and they head for the plain  
No need for the whip or no need for the rein  
  
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight  
Who snaps it asunder the very next night  
Some say it's him some say it's her  
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair  
  
So my darlin' my darlin' just let him go by  
That old silhouette on the great western sky  
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along  
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl

And bursted out a crying  
""What I do to thee I do to all  
And I do to Barbara Allen.""

And as they rolled they seemed to say,

And Barbara there anigh him,  
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose,  
And out of hers, a briar.  
They grew and grew to the old churchyard,  
  
Where they couldn't grow no higher,  
And there they tied in a true love's knot.  
The rose wrapped around the briar.

The sun is goin' down smokin', a flaming testiment  
Something has been broken, and it feels permenant.  
  
The little seabird flying, he knows were he wants to go  
Quess I ought to pack my stuff, and do the thing I know  
Turn around and head on back, along the old sea walls  
I felt somthing give and crack, and now I'm sorry that's all head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam

Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be

And leave no trace at all  
While you were reaching for  
The sacred and divine  
She was standing right beside you  
All the time  
  
And the emptiness  
You can't seem to fill  
Beauty fades and pleasures cannot  
Take away the chili  
And the glamor lures you down into a lie  
O but the cup of kindness  
Never will run dry  
  
You hear the vandals  
Howlin' down your walls  
And arm yourself against the ones  
Who want to see you fall  
Till some Holy Grail reveals  
The grand design  
Well it was in a cup of kindness  
All the time

When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed  
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

I feel your heart turn cold as rain  
And know that you'll be gone again  
I hear the front door close  
You say you got to go downtown  
I guess there's someone else you've found  
So why you're still coming round  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I've heard it said that talk is cheap  
But still your words they cut so deep  
Lay me crying in my sleep  
And the pain just grows  
I don't know who's right or wrong  
But all we had is dead and gone  
So why you keep me hanging on  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I'm going to turn and walk away  
There's nothing left for me to say  
It wouldn't change things anyway  
Though, I suppose  
The love I gave was always true  
Well, I don't know what else to do  
And how I'll ever get over you  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry

Safe from all the wind and snow

They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven

I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble

Emmylou Harris,In My Hour Of Darkness,/e/emmylou+harris/in+my+hour+of+darkness_20816498.html,"In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Once I knew a young man  
Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word  
With just his high-beam lights  
  
Who'd have ever thought  
They'd build such a deadly Denver bend  
To be so strong, to take so long  
As it would till the end  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Another young man safely strummed  
His silver string guitar  
And he played to people everywhere  
Some say he was a star  
  
But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Then there was an old man  
Kind and wise with age  
And he read me just like a book  
And he never missed a page  
  
And I loved him like my father  
And I loved him like my friend  
And I knew his time would shortly come  
But I did not know just when  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed

I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again  
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin' everything they had to give  
It wasn't all that bad a way to live  
  
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
You're pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else  
  
Instead of callin' out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money  
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means  
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came  
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him  
He has everyone convinced that he's for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says I'll get paid off on down the line

But that gusher never came in.

The swiftness swept his life away.  
Now I live on Lake Shasta,

Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.  
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney  
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.

But it's a mean piece of water my friend.  
And I may cross on the highway,

My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no worse  
  
I know that there should be more to say I'll just reed your mind  
Let's save what's left unsaid for another time  
'Cause I know there'll be another time  
So until then  
My heart has found another way

I've missed the sweet love you give me  
No other woman could warm me inside  
I need you much more  
Than I realized.  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'm flying home to you  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'll soon be holding you.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
You send me letters to help time go by  
I call your name while I'm dreaming.  
I need to feel you I long for your touch  
I wanna tell you  
I love you so much.  
On the wings ...  
I'll keep your picture  
To kiss and say good night  
But I wanna hold you forever.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
So wipe all those tears away

Never thought I heard you say  
Baby, it's over I just can't take it  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
Only want to be with you  
  
Now you, pretending I just can't fake it  
Lying here on my own, I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying  
  
I'm only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Lost in an endless night  
Drowning in tears  
Only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Caught in the morning light  
Fighting the fears  
Walking down a country lane  
Getting cold in the rain  
  
Darling I can't stop remembering  
When I took your photograph  
You never used to want to laugh  
But I think your smile is the sweetest thing  
Lying here all on my own I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying

WRITERS MARK SPIRO, ROBBIE BUCHANAN  
I see the distant lights ahead  
Another hour or so, and I'll be back in bed  
I guess I really thought  
That I was gone for good  
But you know I never could  
I count the headlights passing by  
With every one I find  
Another reason why  
You'll be sound asleep  
And I'll look a fool  
How could I be so cruel?  
Only love could make me turn around  
And make these tears come tumbling down  
Only love  
Only love could make you stay with me  
I doubt myself but you believe  
Only love  
I wish that I could be that strong  
To see me as I am,  
And love me right or wrong  
I guess I'm still afraid  
To only say goodbye  
So I keep it all inside  
Only love...  
[Chorus]  
So I try to run, but no matter what I do  
I know it's true: I can't go on without you  
Only love...

You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart

Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,

Enrique Iglesias,Freedom 90,/e/enrique+iglesias/freedom+90_20585123.html,"I won't let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
It's the one good thing that I've got  
I won't let you down  
So please don't give me up  
Because I would really, really love to stick around  
  
Heaven knows I was just a young boy  
Didn't know what I wanted to be  
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy  
And I guess it was enough for me  
To win the race? A prettier face!  
Brand new clothes and a big fat place  
On your rock and roll TV  
But today the way I play the game is not the sameNo way  
Think I'm gonna get me some happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I told you so  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone else I've got to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Take back your singing in the rain  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy  
What a kick just a buddy and me  
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy  
We were living in a fantasy  
We won the race  
Got out of the place  
I went back home got a brand new face  
For the boys on MTV  
But today the way I play the game has got to change  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm gonna get myself happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I stopped the show  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone I forgot to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Don't think that I'll be back again  
I just hope you understandSometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Well it looks like the road to heaven  
But it feels like the road to hell  
When I knew which side my bread was buttered  
I took the knife as well  
Posing for another picture  
Everybody's got to sell  
But when you shake your ass  
They notice fast  
And some mistakes were built to last  
  
That's what you get  
  
I say that's what you get  
  
That's what you get for changing your mind  
  
And after all this time  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes  
Do not make the man  
  
I'll hold on to my freedom  
May not be what you want from me  
Just the way it's got to be  
Lose the face nowI've got to live

Trying to live my life  
It's been 6 months since you left me

Dancing with that guy  
Made it so hard for me to watch baby  
I just been around running in circle  
I'm going through it in my mind baby  
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls  
To stop from crying out loud baby

Leave you begging baby come back home  
  
And it's only till she's gone

Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman

When your wings melt and you come undone  
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one  
  
She steals your heart just like a thief  
Makes you lay roses at your feet  
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed

You beauty came free of vanity  
Opened my mind, gave me your anatomy

Your more than just a one night stand  
I need some supervision  
I'm losing all control of my hands  
In your command

Rise above all fear, it's time to care.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotized  
And they're stepping lightly  
  
Hang each night in rapture  
Back to back, sacroiliac  
Spineless movement and a wild attack  
Face to face sightless solitude  
  
And it's finger popping  
Twenty- four hour shopping in rapture  
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly  
DJ spinning I said ""My My""  
  
Flash is fast flash is cool  
'Francois c'est pas flashe non due'  
  
And you don't stop sure shot  
Go out to the parking lot  
And you get in your car and drive real far  
And you drive all night and then you see a light  
  
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground  
And out comes a man from Mars  
And you try to run but he's got a gun  
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head  
  
And then you're in the man from Mars  
You go out at night eating cars  
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too  
Mercury's and Subaru  
  
And you don't stop  
You keep on eating cars  
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night  
And eat up bars where the people meet  
  
Face to face  
Dance cheek to cheek  
One to one  
Man to man  
  
Dance toe to toe  
Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars  
He's eating bars  
Yeah wall to wall  
  
Door to door  
Hall to hall  
He's gonna eat 'em all  
Rapture  
Be pure  
  
Take a tour through the sewer  
Don't strain your brain  
Paint a train  
You'll be singing in the rain  
  
Said don't stop to the punk rock  
Toe to toe, dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotised  
  
And they're stepping lightly  
Hang each night in rapture  
Well now you see what you want to be  
Just have your party on TV  
  
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on  
And now he's gone back up to space  
Where he won't have the hassle with the human race  
And you hip hop  
And you don't stop  
  
Just blast off  
Sure shot  
Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars  
And eating bars  
And now he only eats guitars  
  
Get up! Get up! Get up!

You left me reelin' with this feelin'.  
On the rising curve  
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,  
You won't get anything you don't deserve

You hang the flame, you'll pay the price,

You were striped, you were plain,

It's too late, she's gone.  
  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
She's gone, my baby's gone.  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
Where can my baby be?  
  
And I wonder does she know  
When she left me, it hurt me so.  
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait.  
Tell me it's not too late.

Can't seem to find somebody  
Someone to care  
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to no where

Every minute, every hour, every day  
  
Oh I'm hoping to discover  
A certain kind of lover  
Who will show me the way  
  
And my arms need someone  
Someone to enfold  
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold  
Love for all my life to have and to hold  
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love

Oh nothing but Sunday oh yea

All through my mind  
I'm in love what can I do

Just comes back alive  
  
She rides like the wind  
On a summers night  
And she gives and takes  
In the love she makes

She makes everything so right  
  
My sweet love child...  
  
By the light of the morning  
Like an angel's sigh  
I can feel her breath  
Lying next to me  
With the world locked outside  
  
I can feel  
A taste so sweet  
And she gives me love  
All the precious love  
It makes my life so complete

He stayed down there  
With his velvet pills  
And her purple hair  
In a room so dark  
They could barely crawl  
With orange posters  
On Victorian walls  
It was Saturday night  
And he felt like death  
She just wanted to be loved  
Like anybody else  
Saturday night  
And the clock never stopped  
She felt like a loser  
On top or the pops  
The Chelsea lovers  
With guillotine lips  
Mascara egos  
Doing a magazine strip  
Chelsea lovers  
In a vicious town  
With lipstick futures  
Like a couple of clowns  
Strange creatures  
In the eider down  
Teenage oblivion  
Waiting to be crowned  
Holes in the mattress  
Where these beasts have lain  
Awake until morning  
With ice in their veins  
Facing each other  
Their eyes never met  
He just wanted to be straight  
It never happened to him yet  
Both of them laughing  
But they can't understand  
What it is about friendship  
Makes you hold your own hand  
The Chelsea lovers  
Oh how they can talk  
With their tongues connected  
And their skin like chalk  
Chelsea lovers  
They're joined at the hip  
With the power of madness  
At their fingertips  
Chelsea lovers  
With their limbs entwined  
Making moon sized promises  
From their molecule minds  
Stardust lovers  
In a Ziggy cartoon  
Two solemn lovers  
In a Chelsea room.

Except the beggars in the doorways of designer perfection  
There was a thin man collecting for a government problem  
He spent a long time waiting with that look of disapproval  
There was icicles forming in the agency windows but nothing for sale there  
Only dreamtime oblivion  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
And there's a tightrop marriage between the doctor and the junkie  
In daylight it's perfect but at night time it's frightening  
The hospital was moved so the hotel could profit  
But nobody stayed up there to curse it or to mock it  
As hi-fi condition arranged for my transport  
But there's nothing to hear except the sound of bloody progress  
The buildings are blushing from the interest they're earning  
But the tables and the chairs on the bombsites are burning  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
Let's have a look, what do you see  
I saw Thatcher and Murdoch those twins of confusing  
Pay Saatchi and Saatchi to keep up their little illusion  
I saw pepsi and my hero both digging a goldmine  
It's funny how money can make you deaf as well as blind
