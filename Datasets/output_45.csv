About the stuff you'll say  
And me and I, I can't let it slide  
The paper's not here yet the sun's not up  
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside  
I had one of those dreams that make it all so  
Clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?  
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie  
I wanted to believe in you  
You took your chances and one was me  
So I'll just forgive you and set you free  
I'm on my way  
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze  
And it's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
I wanna put the past behind  
Try and maybe I can find better days  
The first time in a while  
Think I even feel a smile on my face  
I got a whole new perspective  
You can't treat me that way  
It's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way

Can I find a wa to be  
Every part of me, yeah?

To find out where I'm meant to belong  
I've always wanted to be where I am today

In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
[Chorus]  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know that you'd be here right now  
If I could let you know somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar will remain  
  
Every rose, every rose  
Every rose, has its thorn  
  
I know I could saved a love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
  
And now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
And to hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Don't hear a single thing I say,  
Say anythings to me,  
Anything to get you on my head.  
Don't know how I really feel,  
Cause it's the faith  
That makes it like that I don't care  
Don't know how much it hurts

Like somehow you could be replaced  
And I could walk away  
From the promises we made  
And swore we'd never break

And on and on

I kept the moments  
That we were in  
And I knew in my heart  
That you  
Would come back for me

Started questioning us, are we really in love  
Trying to figure out chapter three  
But you're not giving me anything  
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on

But this is no book of us

Arguing about nothing  
You told me it's as good as it gets  
Yeah I'm real emotional  
Blame it on your mental jokes  
How much did you think that I could take  
So much for taking this too far  
You can't blame me for who I am  
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say ""My true love ain't here""  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala

Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so

We can

Having fun without a plan  
But that's what we do

Gotta make this party grow  
Together we can make it blow  
Right through the roof  
The music's gonna start a revolution  
Too late to play it safe

We don't have to paint by numbers  
Let our voice come out from under  
Hear it rise  
Feel the thunder  
It's time to lose control

Pumpin' up the party now  
Party now, party now

And Annie Leibovitz tryin'a get me nude,  
For those of you who think that's very crude...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
I never stole a necklace or got a dui,  
I never cheated on my wife like that golfer guy,  
So what, you can see a little boob from the side...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
And sure, I danced on a pole,  
And people called it sinning,  
But at least I didn't date a porn star,  
And tell everyone 'I'm winning'!  
  
(A Guy And A Girl Walk On Stage)  
  
Girl - She never made a dirty tape and passed it along,  
Guy - She didn't text a photo of her dong,  
Miley - Don't both of these things seem worse than a bong... !

I'm so Sorry,  
I'm really sorry... That I'm not perfect!

It doesn't matter anyhow  
You can take your things  
And go your own way  
  
And there's two more lonely people

Baby, you and I  
Are just two more lonely people

Well you know my heart is aching  
You don't have to break it  
If love don't change your mind  
Then there's two more lonely people tonight  
  
I don't want the pictures  
I don't want your sympathy  
We don't have to be friends  
We don't have to be enemies  
  
In my head I break it down  
And I'm absolutely sure  
That you and I could work it out  
Or we could kill the lights  
On what we had before  
  
And there's two more lonely people

Nothing is predictable

Maybe lately baby  
It's been a little rough  
But if you walk away tonight  
  
We'll be two more lonely people

The night bursts into flame  
Dance Helena... Dance

Would you still love me anyway?  
There's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be  
And I close the door on my fantasies  
Why don't you love me anyway

Centennial breeding in the midnight sun  
Caused by a war, never won  
Mistakes of a man in the past  
Results of a nuclear blast  
  
Man versus man, land against land  
Life blew apart from greed in their hearts  
  
Every hundred years they're born again

The masquerade of loneliness

And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,  
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,  
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims  
I got distracted with meaningless games,  
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,  
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,  
Doomed to find out things a little too late,  
And so I must play this broken man's role,  
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.  
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,

I wake as I have always done,  
To freshly scented sycamore  
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor.  
My steaming coffee warms my face  
I'm disappointed in the taste.  
But there's a peace the early brings  
The morning world of growing things.  
  
I feel the moments hurry on  
It was today, it's died away,  
And now it is forever gone.  
And I will drink my coffee slow  
And I will watch my shadow grow  
And disappear in firelight  
And sleep alone again tonight.

Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
And my mind sends me reeling, breathing and feeling,  
I remember the time when I tried to come clean,  
But my interests collided, besides I was misguided,  
And who do you confide in when you trip on a dream?  
And look down,  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
If you want to come with me and tell me what you see,  
Just step in beside me and do what you want,  
And you may see clearly, though it sometimes is lonely,  
To be free is the only possession that counts.

And years from now I'll turn around and see  
The girl I left behind me  
  
I told myself that things would be OK  
You would come around to my way any day  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No, you couldn't change or be rearranged  
I'm picking up the pieces of my life

Put me down, turned me round  
Turned me round to see  
Marble halls, open doors  
Someone found the key  
And it's only what you do  
That keeps coming back on you  
And it's only what you say  
That can give yourself away  
'cause it's easier to try  
Than to prove it can't be done  
And it's easier to stay

Divided by an ocean, an ocean

If you could take a little time to slow down  
It's more your style  
It takes a lifetime to decide

Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
So choose one wisely.  
  
Not all angels can grow wings  
They seem to soar by other means  
You can fly although it seems  
A little slowly.

There's life in other worlds

Is there to be climbed  
The sea of serenity  
Is rightfully mine  
Step on to the water  
Knowing what is true  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories

Is to live it all again

The rhythm of love  
The earth that's beneath us  
The heavens above

Calling out to me  
The changes we go though  
Are making me strong  
The shelter of friendship  
Is where we belong  
Look into the future  
Knowing what we see

And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain

Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows for the rain  
  
The whirlpool of doubt  
Can spin you around  
The wave of emotion  
Takes you up  
Pulls you down  
Leaving far behind us  
Sweet young passions spray  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age

To a frog sat strumming  
On a guitar with only one string

As a lark began to sing  
The sounds kept coming  
With Jack Rabbit loudly drumming  
On the side of a biscuit tin

Water ballet so surprising  
A mouse played a daffodil  
A mole came up blinking  
Underneath an owl who's thinking  
How he came to be sat on a hill

And the bees hummed in harmony  
And the owl played his oboe  
Then the frog's guitar solo  
It was all just too much for me

It was because he was not understanding.

Let insipid figures of light pass by  
The mighty light of ten thousand suns  
Challenges infinity and is soon gone  
  
Nighttime to some, a brief interlude  
To others the fear of solitude  
Brave Helios, wake up your steeds  
Bring the warmth the countryside needs

Came to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying.  
Just as new life will come from death, love will come at leisure.  
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure  
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen.  
Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream.

Moody Blues,When A Child Is Born,/m/moody+blues/when+a+child+is+born_20338534.html,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny spark lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born.

Too old to be a child star  
Too young to take leads  
Four seasons passed  
And they axed you  
Nervous juvenile

What became of you?  
Did that swift eclipse torture you?

Kills the both of us, so what  
To die by your side

I would swear I was falling  
I could swear I was falling

The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more

Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time

I walk around,  
Heavy-hearted and sad  
Night comes around  
And I'm still feeling bad  
Rain pourin' down  
Blinding every hope I had  
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad  
  
Love, love, love, love  
This misery will be the end of me  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Can't go on  
Everything I had is gone

Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.  
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
  
All you gals will get the blues,  
All you pals will surely lose.  
And, there's but one excuse.  
Now I've told you who she was,  
And I've told you what she does,  
Still, give this gal her dues.

I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me  
Cause I'm gonna be true  
If you let me  
  
You're gonna love me  
Like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together  
Unhappy together  
And won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

You want me to forget pretend we've never met  
And I tried and I tried but I haven't yet  
You walk by and I fall to pieces  
  
I fall to pieces  
Each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces  
Time only adds to the flame  
  
You tell me to find someone else to love  
Someone who'll me too  
The way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new  
  
You walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I couldn't care less now that we're through  
I only sit home and I wait for his phone call

He never meant a thing to me, he's gone  
I'm glad, I'm free

Come to the magical mist where the oceans kissed  
A thousand kisses or more on the sandy shore  
And never says goodbye

Run with the wind at your side let it set you free  
I'll watch the sun in your eyes as the seagulls fly  
Along this lover's isle

There's always somebody tempting you  
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong  
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold  
And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold  
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple  
Man I ain't going for that

Some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast

There's a heaven of blue  
And we'll go there, just you and I  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
And climb that stairway to the stars  
With love beside us to fill the night with a song  
  
We'll hear the sound of violins  
Out yonder where the blue begins  
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along  
  
Chorus:  
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal  
Over the rim of the hill?  
Can't we sail away on a little dream  
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Like a haunting refrain  
And I find you  
Spinning 'round  
In my brain  
Like the bubbles  
In a glass of champagne  
  
You go to my head  
Like a sip  
Of sparkling Burgundy brew  
And I find  
The very mention of you  
Like the kicker  
In a julep or two  
  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might  
Give a thought to my plea  
Casts a spell over me  
Still I say to myself  
""Get a hold of yourself""  
""Can't you see  
That it never can be?""  
  
You go to my head  
With a smile  
That makes  
My temperature rise  
Like a summer  
With a thousand July's  
You intoxicate my soul  
With your eyes  
  
Though I'm certain  
That this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost  
If a chance  
In this crazy romance  
You go to my head

He gives us love so strong we can't deny.

I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday, I'll make a way  
  
Where did she go wrong, how did she get here?  
Livin' hard and looking older than her years  
Miss Little Big Town  
Trying to hold a job down  
Doing what she could to choke her fears  
  
But she was strong  
And she would survive  
A spark of hope had kept her dream alive  
And she cried...  
  
I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday, I'll make a way  
Someday, I'll make a way  
  
Walking down the road  
In the city where she'd come with so much hope  
Her vision had long died  
Along with all her pride  
And she found herself at the end of her rope  
  
But she heard angels through the door  
Of a church she'd passed a million times before  
There was a song of heaven ringing  
And soon she found herself believing  
That out there maybe there was something more  
  
So she bowed her head to pray  
And said, Jesus, please make a way  
  
And she heard Him say...  
  
I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though you may not understand  
Today, I'll make a way  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Today He'll make a way

In the silence of the early morning

Keep my head on straight  
And don't look down

I'm losing ground

Fall down  
Don't understand the things I do  
But they tell me I'll be fine

Till things just keep improving

Washed away tomorrow

Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
  
And I wanted everything  
Salted you could bring me  
Daylight  
A dream burning in the sky  
Leaves my spirit dry  
And you lied  
Now look what I've become  
  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
Couldn't run  
Lost in what you'd done  
Look what I've become.

You think it's over but it'd just begun  
And I want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I'll drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
  
Twenty questions ringing in my head  
The moment's over but it's never dead  
What did I say and what does all this meant  
'Cause I want you, I want you  
Fire light as it hit you right  
Heads are turned as you walk on by  
Maybe we belong in another time  
I still want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
  
How many things can you wish for?  
'Cause just wishing is all I do  
When it comes to you  
How many lives can you live through?  
How many times can you keep movin', keep movin'  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you

Natalie Imbruglia,Want,/n/natalie+imbruglia/want_20873151.html,"A round of applause, you got what you want  
Take a good look at what you give up  
Because I'm telling you  
A heart can't be unbroken, oh, oh  
  
And can you remember how I kiss you  
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth  
'Cause baby, the memory is all you get now  
And I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
Does every morning make you happy?  
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep?  
I hope you find it's easy to forget me, oh, oh  
  
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me  
I wonder if you're out there having fun  
I hope you get all that you really wanted  
'Cause I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
Don't you see the light has changed  
And nothing looks the same  
Just shadows on the ground  
And if you listen carefully you'll hear the sound  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
(All that you want)  
'Cause I didn't  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
('Cause I didn't)  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want

Natalie Imbruglia,What's The Good In Goodbye?,/n/natalie+imbruglia/whats+the+good+in+goodbye_20873824.html,"All my stars are upside down  
And you're there when I turn around  
I don't wanna be on my own  
And I don't wanna bring you down  
I just can't figure out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
When you touch down, remember this  
The more you leave behind  
The more I miss  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
And I don't wanna wake alone  
I just can't work it out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
Did you have to go, I don't wanna see you leave  
What good of memories, distance stretch further with the time  
Every time I close my eyes, you're fight off the sunrise  
Now we're voices down the line, tell me, tell me why  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello, when you're gone  
So long, I don't know  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When there's heaven in hello  
I'll never know why you have to go

Desperate, desperate  
The stars above  
Held you back once again  
  
Half way here  
Half way here  
They whisper  
You talk so much sense  
  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery when you're sleeping  
  
I saw your tears  
Violet, violet  
And it's been years  
The skies been crying for you  
  
I found out beautiful things about you  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When you're sleeping  
  
So you go and wonder  
Where you wander  
Lose yourself to  
Take us higher  
And I'll be waiting  
For you when you're down  
  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When you're sleeping  
  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping

And it's why i don't know

I don't want to go home (?)

The tables turning on the game she plays  
Everybody's asking questions  
Everybody's wanting more
