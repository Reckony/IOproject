Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin',

Can't take a good day without a bad one  
Don't feel just to smile until I had one  
Where did I learn?  
I make a fuss about a little thing  
  
The rhyme is losing to the riddling  
Where's the turn?  
I don't want a home  
I go into habits where my habits have a habitat  
  
Why did it turn?  
Oooh, after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops

I am likely to miss the main event  
If I stop to cry and complain again  
So I will keep a deliberate pace  
Let the damn breeze dry my face  
  
Ooh mister, wait until you see  
What I plan to be  
I've got a plan to demand and it just began  
And if you're right, you'll agree  
  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here comes a better version of me

For when they placed it on his head

And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away""

With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

The streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard them holler, ""Stop!""

Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust,  
Spontaneously combust  
What would happen if we kissed?  
  
Ahhhh...  
Oh  
Ahhhh...  
  
I struggle with myself again  
Quickly the wall, I'm crumbling  
Don't know if I can turn away

Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?

Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?

Mouth to mouth.

Oehh-oh

My love wrecked you  
You're back to twirl your skirt at the palace  
It hurt more than it ought to hurt  
I went to work to cultivate a callous  
  
And now I'm hard, too hard to know  
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left alone  
  
Oh and I tried to love  
And I can love the same man and the same bed and the same city  
But not in the same room it's a pity but oh  
It never bothered me before  
Not 'til this guy  
What a guy  
Oh, God, what a good guy  
And I can't even enjoy him

My woes are granular  
The ants weigh more than the elephants  
Nothing, nothing is manageable  
So couldn't we skip the valedictories  
I can see your door there  
Shut it and forget my number

And only hollow rhythms resounded from within  
  
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full  
And sank in the burrows of my keep

In a pile at my feet  
And my winter giving way to warm  
As I'm singing him to sleep  
  
He goes along just as a water lily  
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats  
Unweighed down by passion or intensity  
Yet unaware of the depth upon, which he coasts  
And he finds a home in me  
For what misfortune sows  
He knows my touch will reap

[Repeat: x2]

I don't beg for no sympathy  
But if it is not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love,  
Please send me someone to love.

Fiona Apple,Poem,/f/fiona+apple/poem_20502214.html,"(Recited before performing Sleep To Dream)  
  
""When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king  
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight  
And he'll win the whole thing before he enters the ring  
There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might  
So when you go solo you hold your own hand  
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights  
And if you know where you stand then you know where to land  
And if you fall it won't matter ''cause you know that you're right""

Fiona Apple,Pure Imagination,/f/fiona+apple/pure+imagination_21068467.html,"Come with me  
And you'll be  
In a world of  
Pure imagination  
Take a look  
And you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
We'll begin with a spin  
Traveling in a world of my creation  
What we'll see will defy explanation  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it

There's a thousand without a word  
Redbird, don't say you told me so  
Just give me one more song to go.  
  
Do I read a message in your eyes  
You want to love to stay another night  
Baby when you day goes down  
I won't be waitin' around for you.

Oh, tell me who wrote the book of love  
Was it somebody from above (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...)  
Surely he must know all the rules (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...)  
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools  
Must have been someone from above  
Tell me, who wrote the book of love (oh, oh, oh, oh...whoa...)

All their mistakes

Someone in heaven above  
Shop me how to love

Don't let waters of caution remove you  
Don't let the fire of saints compel you  
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life  
Cause soon it's all over, you're gonna come through alive  
Well I've been all over the world five times or more  
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes  
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire  
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive  
And the roses that are offing  
They are real as evening wind  
They are washed by love and suffering  
Cause my love has colored them  
Colored them  
Oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses  
Don't dam the river that's running through you  
Stop saving up for time that may never become  
I've seen the future come true in twenty days  
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday  
I've had my share of blue revelations  
And I know that time is a region to be passed  
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire  
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by  
Cause a rose that will be growing  
In the place where I have hidden  
It is washed by love and suffering  
That my love has colored in  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the rooooooooses  
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh

I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind  
You're just a mystery to me  
I'll reclaim the thunder  
Dry the tears I've cried...still...  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do  
Why people lie, and break a heart in two  
I wonder why  
Things go the way they do

A reflection in the window  
All the way to Point Dume  
Illume, like it dances  
I am a cliff dweller  
From the old school  
  
I like the coastal cities  
I like the lights  
I like the way the ocean blends  
Into the city at night  
It's like living on a working river  
The coastline is glittering  
Like a diamond snake  
In a black sky

Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through

Shadow of a stranger

I wouldn't trade you for jade  
Or for diamonds  
Not for one minute  
Not for anything  
I need you to be there  
Just remember when I am haunted  
That I was just so scared  
  
I'm alone now

Of how we could get out

How then will you feel  
Will you miss those arms  
That used to go around you.  
  
So she stood in the hallway frozen  
In the dark  
And her heart broke down  
She cried  
She fell to the floor  
One tear... Slid across her lip  
To the corner of her mouth  
Love is  
And dropped... To the floor  
  
Love is  
You've got the softest lips  
Love is  
The touch of your fingertips  
Ooh she says, love is  
Knowing you won't let go  
Love is  
Watching you go  
You're so very powerful  
Love is  
Am I happy  
Yes I am  
  
Do I know you love me now  
Yes I do  
Do I know you cannot stay  
I know  
All about love  
All about love  
Love is  
You're so very powerful

Someone with that kind of intensity  
You touched my hand I played it cool  
And you reached out your hand for me

It's a certain time  
It's a certain place  
You touched my hand and you smiled  
All the way back you held out your hand  
If I hope and I pray  
Ooh it might work out someday  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end  
I'll never live to match the beauty again

Caught in a man's world  
And as her world turns  
She feels so alone  
Still she's a danger girl  
Insane far beyond her years  
On some things she's very clear  
She's a wild adventurer

Her black robes trailing  
Sister of the moon  
  
And a black widow spider makes  
More sound than she  
And black moons in those eyes of hers  
Made more sense to me  
Heavy persuasion  
  
It was hard to breathe  
She was dark at the top of the stairs  
And she called to me  
And so I followed  
  
As friends often do  
I cared not for love, nor money  
I think she knew  
The people, they love her  
And still they are the most cruel  
  
She asked me  
Be my sister, sister of the moon  
Some call her sister of the moon  
Some say illusions are her game  
Wrap her in velvet  
  
Does anyone, ah, know her name  
So we make our choices  
When there is no choice  
And we listen to their voices  
Ignoring our own voice

And the end of everything  
You can bend over backwards

I saw desires that burned in you  
The need for power to be a king  
And I saw that you would use this world

But it's one of my eyes for one of yours  
And you'll never get no love at all

Put your hands up

Get that ass on the floor  
Ladies put your lipstick up

While you're hating I get money  
Then I double up tonkers

Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver  
Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa  
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors  
Norway no you didn't get my flowers  
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward  
Face just showers, the minute in a hour  
Heard about the news all day went sour  
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead  
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes  
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested  
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless  
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace  
DUI never said i was driving reckless  
You and I or jealously was not oppressive

And i put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix  
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it  
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket  
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit  
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid  
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics  
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing  
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring  
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans  
I'm on another planet  
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries  
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit  
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish  
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish  
No cheers i know you wouldn't panic

Flo-Rida,Jealous,/f/flo+rida/jealous_20785217.html,"It's been a month since the Fourth of July  
Stood there and stared at the grief in my eyes  
Leave it to me to live out a lie  
So I sat on the curb and I cried like a child  
Catching my breath just walk for awhile  
And I thought of what could go wrong  
I'm already gone  
Don't say a word  
I can't hear you  
Don't hold me close  
I can't feel you  
So I stopped at the store to grab cigarettes  
Couldn't say it out loud couldn't fathom it yet  
You finally feel and we feel like this  
I'm sorry just wasn't enough destroying your faith  
Preserving your trust we couldn't choose  
And neither could I  
I know that I left you for dead  
Don't give up so soon  
Because you know that we all have a bed  
It's waiting for you in the recovery room  
Just forget everything that I said  
Washed out the wounds  
Walls painted red  
Waiting for you in the recovery room  
She stood there in her summer dress  
Wind caught her hair and failed to confess  
I smiled as we raced through the night  
My hand caught her wings then nothing felt right  
I know that I left you for dead  
Don't give up so soon  
Because you know that we all have a bed  
It's waiting for you in the recovery room  
Just forget everything that I said  
Washed out the wounds  
Walls painted red  
Waiting for you in the recovery room

To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind

But these tears got me searching for an inner tube  
Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose  
Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical  
I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain  
BD I love you my sister died but it never changed  
My last love that we just ditched in my brain  
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name  
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain  
Lord knows I wish death never had a name  
Our last breath that it never had a relevate  
Wyclef, Flo Rida here to tell it man  
To the left, move, hurt for suffering  
I lose myself when I think about my people's slain

Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some  
Big will I know heaven got the futon  
Face good with the man paid your dues done  
Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk  
We had plans, plans change the new sun  
The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one  
If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past  
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back  
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said  
I were IP use it like its pixel flap  
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times  
Everyday be forever when I'm putting down  
Showing off that's the truth nah

Take the Breena and stuck em up all with answers  
Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen

Growing up like the women from the exorcist  
Her heart stopped in the ambulance

Hopped out of that house with my swagger  
Hop in that with dough, I got places to go!  
People to see, time is precious  
Look at my crowd and they out of control  
Just like my mind where I'm going  
No women, no shorties, no nothing but clothes  
No stopping now, my parolees on role  
I like my jewelry, that's always on gold  
I know the storm is coming  
My pockets keep telling me it's gonna shower  
Call up my homies that's home  
Then pop in the night cause it's meant to be ours  
We keep a fade away shot cause we balling  
It's platinum patron that be ours

My paper planes making a dance  
Get dirty all night, that's part of my thing  
Re-building castles that's made out of sand  
She's amazing, the fire blazing  
Hotter than Cajun!  
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?  
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage  
That body belong on a poster  
I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me  
Like damn it I know you  
You wanna show like a gun out of holster  
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

Flo-Rida,Still Missin',/f/flo+rida/still+missin_20735945.html,"[Chorus:]  
My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my
hoe's still missin'.  
My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my
hoe's still missin'.  
Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my
hoe's still missin'.  
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's greener on
the other side.  
  
I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my hoe got missin'.  
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position.  
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin'.  
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then
witness.  
Well I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions.  
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen.  
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission.  
I'm sheddin' tears messin up my vision, this hoe gon' make me go to prison.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That hoe cost me my job, I'm afraid I should of learned mo' about the
business.  
A hoe is good for diggin', I should of know this from the beginnin'.  
I don' got caught slippin' now I'm tripping out the door somebody else found
interest.  
Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different. Better to know then
have intuitions.  
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.  
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this
bitch came from a bar?  
Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage. I was a gentlemen right from the start.  
Ever since I put the hoe in my touch, now this bitch won't even spare me the
rod.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
7 years now it's all over, now hold on goin' gotta feel me brah.  
Left my home, no sign of luck. I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone.  
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of
bucks.  
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.  
If I would of known my hoe was just temporary.  
And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.  
I feel like going to war like the military.  
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.  
  
[Chorus]

And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely  
Means that I don't know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune, but

Carry on, you will always remember  
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor

Skeeter, he met this girl that lived  
Next door to Toss's  
And within a couple of weeks he started  
Living with her, you know?  
And I guess she had a lot of money or something  
Cause she was constantly buying him clothes  
And getting him lots of stuff and loading him  
With money, you know?  
He was constantly going to the coffee shop  
Always getting the best herb and the best  
Hash, you know?  
He was in good shape  
She was really good looking, she was  
Really cool  
I, I don't think he'd ever met her before  
But she had, you know, other boyfriends I suppose  
So I'm sitting on the couch, you know, in  
Toss's apartment  
And I'm reading, you know, maximum rock and  
Roll or flip side  
One of those punk things  
And I heard Skeeter come in  
And he came in and he had all these really  
Nice clothes on  
She bought him all this stuff  
She like bought him cologne  
He was really really smelling good, you know  
He looked good too  
You know he came in and put his herb  
On the table and, whatever  
I'm just reading my little punk magazine  
Not really paying attention  
And then he says, uh, he says hey dave  
And I look up  
And he's standing there with his dick  
In his hand  
And he's kinda got it like lifted up so  
He's looking at the head of his dick  
He kinda pointed it at me  
I didn't know what to think  
He said does that look like pus to you  
I said no I think it's lint

Down at the liquor store.  
Beneath the neon sky.  
Our moonlight.  
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice.  
The pan's dried up so tight.  
With hardened beans.  
We're hungry.  
So I lean on you sometimes.  
Just to see you're still there.  
Your feet can't take the weight of one.  
Much less two.  
We hit concrete.  
How were we born into this mess?  
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby.  
But we were run out on a rail.  
Fell from the wagon to the night train.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
Cigarettes they fill the gaps.  
In our empty days.  
In our broken teeth.  
We're jonesing.  
Say mister, can you spare a dime?  
Some change could make a change.  
Could buy some time.  
Some freedom.  
Or an ear to hear my story.  
It's all I've got. My fiction  
Beats the hell out of my truth.  
A palm upturned burnt blue.  
Don't call it sunburn.  
You've been shaking on the job.  
Just one drink ahead of your past.  
There's a white light coming up.  
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.

And burned into the dark

I had to be what never was  
Been so hungry I could lie  
You took my word, I took your wine  
And held you in my bloody hands  
These rattled bones and rubber bands  
Washed them in the muddy water  
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

That ladder that leads you to that place.  
Below and every day you lose other you.  
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other.  
Step ladder you climb the other way.  
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting,  
Cheating and acting. selfish makes your heart.  
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish.  
Take it from me, don't you be a do-badder up,  
A do-badder up, a do-badder up, just step up for that.  
Step ladder and climb the other way.

Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to

Empty, faces of women mourning  
When everything's been taken from them.  
Me, don't ask me about empty.

Empty is a string of dirty days  
Held together by some rain.  
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again.  
Empty is the color of the fear  
Long about September when the days  
Go marching in a line toward November.  
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night  
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light.  
Empty is me.

And I remember the time I broke your father's arm  
And I remember, remember all the love we shared  
Every place and everywhere  
Oh charva, charva  
I love you more and more  
I swear it ain't because your father owns a liquor store  
Charva, my baby  
I love you and I don't know what to do about it  
Oh-oh charva

It's better that I tell you this tonight  
Our affair has been quite heated  
You thought I was what you needed  
But the time has come, my darlin'  
To set things right, 'cause  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
You been like a little angel  
How you loved me  
I appreciate the warmth of your embrace  
Well, the world don't need to know  
How I adored you  
But there's somethin' I must tell you, darlin'  
Face to face...  
I'll be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband

An' I don't want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
So it's adios, adios, my little darlin'  
(adios my little darlin'...)  
Gotta go now...  
Keep that hankie that I gave you for  
When you cry  
There are things that trouble me  
And I'm sure that you must see  
That it breaks my heart the same as yours  
When we say good-bye  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer...much, much, much

Frankie Laine,Riders In The Sky,/f/frankie+laine/riders+in+the+sky_20304128.html,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost herd in the sky  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat  
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet  
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name  
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""  
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""  
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

oh, it's a B double E double, are you N.  
  
I can't stop thinking  
What the hell they were drinking  
When they made this county dry  
I got a week long thirst  
And to make it worse  
Lord, it's my turn to drive  
  
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on  
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home  
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long  
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone  
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again  
Like a B double E double, are you N.

When two strangers shared a night  
And in the darkness found a light  
That to this day is still alive and burning there.

And not too many people came  
But that didn't matter to them  
They laughed and loved all through the night  
And as they faced the morning light  
They found themselves standing there again.  
  
And he asked her twice to come along  
They said good-bye at the break of dawn  
As his bus left out she cried  
With him standing by her side  
That ol' wind had once again found it's way home.  
Someday he'll tell her about the money he hid  
And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid.  
But for right now they're both in love  
The only thing they're thinkin' of  
Is that they're finally where their hearts have always been.

A teenage kid so far from home  
She was a lonely widow woman  
Hell bent to make it on her own  
We were a thousand miles from nowhere  
Wheat fields as far as I could see  
Both needing something from each other  
Not knowing yet what that might be  
'Til she came to me one evening  
Hot cup of coffee and a smile  
In a dress that I was certain  
  
She hadn't worn in quite a while  
There was a difference in her laughter  
There was a softness in her eyes  
And on the air there was a hunger  
Even a boy could recognize  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
That summer wind was all around me  
Nothing between us but the night  
When I told her that I'd never  
She softly whispered ""That's alright""  
And then I watched her hands of leather  
Turn to velvet in a touch  
There's never been another summer  
When I have ever learned so much  
  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
I often think about that summer  
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace  
  
And I have rarely held another  
When I haven't seen her face  
And every time I pass a wheat field  
And watch it dancing with the wind  
Although I know it isn't real  
I swear inside I feel  
Her hungry arms again  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
  
Raging in her lover's eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
Rushing in long in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burnin' both ends of the night

'So boy, welcome to sleep

I'm shaking and nervous.  
I'm alone in my room and I'm scared of it.

'Don't believe in ghost stories.  
There's nothing to hurt you in here.'

These quiet nights will slowly kill me

Gary Valenciano,Fool Till The End,/g/gary+valenciano/fool+till+the+end_20650937.html,"Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
Its over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
Chorus:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find its me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please

I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong

Gary Valenciano,Gary Valenciano - Letting Go,/g/gary+valenciano/gary+valenciano+letting+go_20632029.html,"I used to feel the emptiness inside me  
I was not supposed to feel that way  
I had everything I needed  
But nothing ever made me  
What I longed to be  
The wealth, the name  
The lights, the fame  
Were everything to me  
And then one night  
Out of the blue  
I heard His name (Jesus)  
And so I took that step of faith  
And walked into His domain  
I believe that's what He wants  
Every heart to do  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
Letting go to know the truth  
Is not so hard to do  
It's the heart that's got the will  
To open up for Him to fill  
And trusting and believing Him  
Is all we've got to do  
It's just the heart that's got to move  
For Him to show His love that's been there  
Even when we never cared  
Take hold of His hand  
Let go and you'll understand  
  
Why be afraid  
For God knows what you're feeling  
But even He can't do a thing  
If He sees the heart's not willing  
And so we ask what's going on  
We want what's right and still do wrong  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
I guess by now you'd realize  
You can't be on your own  
And all your cares  
And all your burdens  
Should be cast upon His throne  
Letting go, just let go, letting go  
Let go and you'll understand  
Just let go and you'll understand

If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
Hercules was far from slim, but I could show them more than him  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
In competitions, exhibitions, Catch as Catch Catch,  
I would win some lovely cups and sauces to match.  
  
The ladies ""white hope"" I would be, they'd hope to see much more of me  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
I'd look swell when out of doors, in my fifty bob plus fours,

He'll iron all day your linen away, he really makes me sore.  
He's lost his heart to a Chinese girl and his laundry's all gone wrong.  
All day he'll flirt and scorch your shirt, that's why I'm singing this song.  
Oh Mr. Wu, what shall I do, I'm feeling kind of Limehouse Chinese Laundry
Blues.  
This funny feeling keeps round me stealing  
Oh wont you throw your sweetheart over do.  
My vest's so short that it won't fit my little brother.  
And my new Sunday shirt has got a perforated rudder.  
Mr. Wu, what shall I

Now Mr. Nu, he's got a naughty eye that flickers.  
You ought to see it wobble when he's ironing ladies blouses.

I'm very daft at dancing, at moonlight or romancing  
I'd rather play noughts and crosses with you.  
  
I've never been one for billiards or darts  
I'm much too shy to play a game of hearts.  
At dog tracks or the races I always lose my braces

Here I am, a funny sort of guy, I wouldn't dare to hold your hand  
Let's begin, maybe I'll let you win, I hope that you understand  
Sitting around a table for two, that's the only thing I want to do  
There's something cute about you, I couldn't do without you  
  
Playing a simple game, tell me you feel the same  
I'd rather play noughts and crosses with you.  
  
I'd rather play noughts and crosses with you  
Than take you to a French non-stop revue.  
It may not be so funny, but still it saves me money.  
I'd rather play noughts and crosses with you.  
  
I haven't the manly figure for sports,  
I never think I look my best in shorts.  
I lose my breath at biking and as for that mixed hiking  
I'd rather play noughts and crosses with you.  
  
One fine day, if luck should come my way, we'll have a little kitchenette.  
You and me, and when we've had our tea, I hope that you won't forget  
  
Playing at noughts and crosses with you  
That's the only way that I can woo  
Though now you're far above me, in time you'll learn to love me  
Isn't it bold and bad - but I feel a lad.  
Playing at noughts and crosses with you.

The place was such a reck  
I couldn't reach the bathroom  
Thought Id better clear the deck  
I tried to call the lawyer  
And ask him what to do  
He referred me to his doctor  
Who referred me back to you  
And when you checked the manual  
You kept in side the case  
It said put it in a cool dry place  
  
I drove around the city  
Looking for a room  
That was high above the water  
Where my things could be in tune  
There was no one to help me  
Nobody even cared  
I had to got through hell  
To get those things up there  
I paid my first subscription  
Then I joined the idle race  
And they said store it in a cool dry place  
  
I got guitar, basses, amplifiers and drums  
Accordions and mandolis and things that sometimes hum  
Cymbals and harmonicas, capos by the score  
And lots of things in boxes laying all around the floor  
  
Some places they get mildew  
And others get too hot  
Some places are so damp that  
Everything you got just rots  
All kinds of condensation  
Directories of the rain  
Theres not much compensation  
When everythings been stained  
Some have sentimental value that  
Cannot be erased  
Go store it in a cool dry place  
  
We got solids and acoustics  
And some from flowered board  
And some are trimmed in leather  
And some are made with gourds  
Theres organs and trombones  
And reverbs we can use  
Lots of dx-7s  
And old athletic shoes  
I bought a great big building  
It took up one whole block  
I made an inventory  
Of all the things in stock  
The place was getting longer  
I was up all night  
I used up all my pencils  
But I went onto spite  
The blury of my vision  
The sweat upon my face  
I've got to put this stuff away  
I mustnt leave a trace  
The landlords breathing down my neck  
He says its a disgrace  
So I said put it in a cool, dry, place.

Sees a shining city on a hill  
Step up close and see he's blind  
Wined and dined  
All he has is pose

Manifesting in the spiritual eye

You conceal, all there is to know  
That's the way it goes

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman  
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years  
  
I once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens  
She out shined all others that I'd known by far  
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor  
Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car

By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan  
I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life  
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'  
She lost her desire to become my young wife

I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan  
Then I started wonderin' what good would it do  
If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition  
Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too

Is you soul and body weary, the task of rowin' hard  
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known

And he knows your trouble and your whole dear life of sin

Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill  
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils  
I bring them to mama at the end of the day  
And say flowers for mama, here's mama's bouquet.  
They brighten her face and she holds me close  
She'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose  
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers  
A smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hours.  
Spoken:  
Now mama was lying there, yes, they tell me she passed away  
And she was surrounded by flowers that out-shined my bouquet  
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while  
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile.

I fill my heart with your kiss. It gave me freedom.  
You knew I could not resist. I needed someone.

Can't believe I'm the one. I was so lonely.  
I feel like noone can feel. I must be dreamin'.  
I want this dream to be real. I'm in this feeling.

Sweet December song  
The melody that saved me  
On those less than Silent Nights  
When snow would fall upon my bed  
Like sugar from Jesus  
And take me to the day  
She could always smile  
The Virgin Child would always show you see  
Just to save me (Just to save me)  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay  
I could believe in peace on Earth  
And I could watch TV all day  
So I dreamed of Christmas  
  
Maybe since you've gone  
I went a little crazy  
God knows they can see the child  
  
But the snow that falls upon my bed  
That loving I needed  
Falls every single day  
For each and every child  
The Virgin smiles for all to see  
But you kept her from me  
  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay

And I could watch TV all day

In your eyes

You heard me cry  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
I'm blessed  
I know  
Heaven sent  
And Heaven stole  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
And what have I learned  
From all this pain  
I thought I'd never feel the same  
About anyone  
Or anything again  
  
But now I know  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
  
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
  
Sadness  
In my eyes  
No one guessed  
Or no one tried  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
Loveless and cold  
With your last breath  
You saved my soul  
You smiled at me  
Like Jesus to a child  
  
And what have I learned  
From all these tears  
I've waited for you all those years  
And just when it began  
He took you away  
  
But I still say  
When you find love  
When you know that it exists  
Then the lover that you miss  
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights  
  
When you've been loved  
When you know it holds such bliss  
Then the lover that you kissed  
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight  
  
So the words you could not say  
I'll sing them for you  
And the love we would have made  
I'll make it for two  
  
For every single memory  
Has become a part of me  
You will always be  
My love  
  
Well I've been loved  
So I know just what love is  
And the lover that I kissed  
Is always by my side  
  
Oh the lover I still miss  
Was Jesus to a child

No tears, no fears, what I want to be.  
One, two, take a look at you  
Death by matrimony!  
  
I remember when he such fun and everthing was fine,  
I remember when we use to have a good time,  
Partners in crime.  
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away,  
Tell me that you're happy now,  
Turning my back-  
Nothing to say!  
  
""Hey tell this jerk to take a hike,  
There's somethin' 'bout that boy I don't like""  
""Well sugar he don't mean the things he said""  
""Just get him outta my way, 'cause I'm seeing red  
We got plans to make, we got things to buy  
And you're wasting time on some creepy guy""  
""Hey shut up chick, that's a friend of mine,  
Just watch your mouth babe, you're out of line""  
  
Ooooooh!  
  
Get back  
Hands off  
Go for it!

You're breaking my heart, you've changed

You're bored with me in every way  
I can't understand you've changed  
  
You've forgotten the word I love you  
Each memory that we've shared  
You ignore every star above you  
I can't realize you ever cared

You're not the angel I once knew  
No need to tell me that we're through

No need to tell me that we're through

But it's hard to fight when you're hurtin' so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just can't go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasn't it beautiful  
Wasn't it the kind of happiness and glow

Hey, come on Joe

With wheels and we ride  
  
We burn up that road to old Mexico  
Blend in with the desert  
Just we amigos  
And we roll  
  
Cowboys like us sure do have fun  
Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun  
Take the long way around back to square one  
Today we're just outlaws out on the run  
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such  
For cowboys like us  
  
We talk about livin', babies, and women  
All that we've lost and all we've been givin'  
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done  
Drink one more cold one, come mornin' get up  
And we roll

You caught him cheating, I don't blame you  
For walking away  
I know where you're coming from, it sounds like where I've been  
Oh there I go interrupting your story once again.  
  
Go on, go on  
You were saying how a fool can only fool you so long.  
It's true, it's so true  
When they do you like that, what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Our conversation won't change nothing,  
But it's sure nice to talk  
With somebody whose been cut of  
The same old cloth  
You know how you said happiness can't be found looking back  
If you don't mind maybe we can talk a little more about that.  
  
Go on, go on  
You were saying this is better than sitting at home.  
It's true, it's so true  
When they do you like that, what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Even when you see no reason to  
Don't wait to live life cause it won't wait for you.  
  
Go on, please go on  
You were saying what don't kill us only makes us strong  
It's true, that's so true  
When they do you like that what else can you do  
But go on,  
Just go on,  
Life goes on,  
And on.

Where they still know wrong from right  
Sing a song about the Heartland

There goes the plans that I made.  
Oh, but you won't hear me complain.

So let's go grab a blanket,  
An' a hot cup of coffee,  
And sit out on the front porch and swing.  
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind:  
We don't have to say anything.  
Let's just listen to that old tin roof sing.

To make it reappear

But life's a journey, no need to hurry  
It's one day at a time

Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
What's down the road we can't say  
And the road behind don't matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
We're takin' it nice and slow  
Safe and sound, covering ground  
Steady as she goes

Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow takes care of itself  
We'll just keep on keepin' on  
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet

Take one step and then take another  
Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction  
Just puttin' one foot in front of the other

Your front lawn looking green  
It's a keen neighborhood  
You visit your sick mother weekly  
Spring for charity freely like a moral man should  
You brought two children in' the world a little boy, a little girl  
You dutifully clothe and you feed them  
Ou come straight home to your wife  
You want no trouble in your life  
You swear you'll never cheat on them  
Now suddenly you're feeling so small  
'cause there's a little bit of judas in us all  
Well, excuse my digression  
But I had the distinct impression she loved me so  
So as not to try her conscience  
She handed me a crock of nonsense while she bled me slow

Sing a new song of mobility  
Get a new fix for seventy six  
And now whether our hair's short or long  
The issue is not really if it's right or wrong  
But as long as it's clean .... right  
I've gotta realize that our new found philosophies  
Were only synthesized in the delusion of a flower child scene  
There's a new star in an old space  
So it's time you open your soul and set yourself free  
Sing a new song of totality  
Get a new fix for seventy six

But then our heros blew their minds  
With X and why's and LSD oh what a sin  
Friend we gotta comprehend and we gotta learn from the past  
And not dwell in it again and again and again  
Hold one hand with time  
And open your mind naturally

We were looking for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To grab hold of what we been readin' for  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
No need to wonder where the future lies  
It's right before our very eyes  
Don't even think it over  
Just say yes  
We were clinging to some old cliches and old familar faces  
But now they're only shattered dreams  
So let's dry our eyes and start away clean  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
We were lookin' for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To open up our aliing hearts once more  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away

One single hope someone real  
Keeps me hangin' on  
  
Now I really don't mind that it's been so long  
If somewhere in this world you exist  
And it really won't seem like it's been so sad  
Just as long as I know I've been missed  
  
Time is on my side  
Cause somehow I know you're there  
Baby I'm talking about someone like you  
I love you in my loneliness  
And it keeps me walking on  
  
I've gotta keep walking to someone I love  
My faith in your reality keeps me hangin' on

And the critics they call you the new 'boy wonder'  
And you know just how to make a young girl cry  
The more you feed them the more they hunger  
As you watch the money multiply

How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be?  
King... for a day  
  
You got the whole damn world spinning 'round your middle finger  
Hey! Shoot a little skeet with the president  
And your mother loves you more for every dollar you bring her  
And yor latest wife is worth every cent

The tuft of hair beneath the lace

So full of life, so close to death  
I'm filled with wild revenge

Or shall I fight my heart no more  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden

An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh  
One of which is in this room  
Wondering 'neath the mood over madness  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win

Or shall I end this lonely war  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
Woman won't you hold me in your arms  
Before you come to harm  
And take this tender love and drive it through my chest  
Stike hard, do it soon

And it's been on my brain just to put the blame on you  
I've gotta find a way just to make my day a useful one  
Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show  
I've got one free pass just to let me know  
Hey babe it's a stagnant time  
But it takes more than that to hang my coat and hat and sleep  
I've gotta sweat once more till my bones feel sore  
I tell you why  
Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show  
I've gotta crash this prison and not let go  
My heart's on a sun cloud screamin' for progress  
'Cause I want work  
I'll keep slavin' my mind just to try to find some kind of light  
I'm gonna burn this damn ticket and think of tomorrow  
And I won't live this long life in stagnation no more

Does the freedom seek the strong or seek the weak  
Do you care  
Would you face the foe or turn your other cheek

I don't know how to love him  
What to do, how to move him  
I've been changed, yes really changed  
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,  
I seem like someone else  
I don't know how to take this  
I don't see why he moves me  
He's a man. He's just a man  
And I've had so many men before,  
In very many ways,  
He's just one more.  
  
Should I bring him down?  
Should I scream and shout?  
Should I speak of love,  
Let my feelings out?  
I never thought I'd come to this  
What's it all about?  
  
Don't you think it's rather funny,  
I should be in this position  
I'm the one who's always been  
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,  
Running every show  
He scares me so  
  
I never thought I'd come to this  
What's it all about?  
What's it all about?  
Yet, if he said he loved me,  
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened  
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope  
I'd turn my head. I'd back away  
I wouldn't want to know  
He scares me so  
Ooh, I want him so  
I love him so

When hope was high and life worth living  
I dreamed that love would never die  
I dreamed that God would be forgiving  
  
Then I was young and unafraid  
And dreams were made and used and wasted  
There was no ransom to be paid  
No song unsung no wine untasted  
  
But the tigers come at night  
With their voices soft as thunder  
As they tear your hope apart  
As they turn your dream to shame  
  
And still I dreamed she'll come to me  
That we would live the years together  
But there are dreams that cannot be  
And there are storms we cannot weather  
  
I had a dream my life would be  
So diff'rent from this hell I'm living  
So diff'rent now from what it seemed  
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed

Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words  
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast  
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the

A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours  
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost  
And with a few words of encouragement and concern  
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all

By forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or something that somebody said because  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world  
Will not be cursing or forgiving  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
  
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junkyards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence  
Tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
  
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron  
In some train yard  
My beard a roughening coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're waitin' from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Give me back that song we sang in harmony just you and me singing together

Saint or sinner call and always find him there  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive

He can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue)  
He alone knows where to find a rainbow's end  
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend  
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold  
He knows every lie that you and I have told

Many's the time someone laid close beside me  
But I don't remember her name mmm mmm  
They'll say that I'm just a smile in the moment  
But that was before you came  
  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million I see  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million for me  
  
Now of all of the others were places to go to  
When I had nowhere to sleep mmm mmm  
I never made any promises to them  
None they'd expect me to keep  
  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million I see  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million for me  
  
You're the one when the day is done  
You're my morning sun Yes you're the one

(Go away)  
But the truth is it won't  
Down the line, will be back again  
It will be back again  
Rather than examine it  
Maybe I should handle it  
What good is it, to close my eyes  
And tell myself another lie  
I gotta get along somehow and sometimes the only way  
Is to close my eyes  
Somtimes I have to close my eyes  
Let you think, you can make a fool out of me  
Guess I set myself up each time  
By trustin' you, so openly  
Yeah, that's the way I wanna be  
That's the way I wanna be  
Woo  
Somtimes I have to close my eyes

Starting again is part of the plan  
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand  
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can  
It may not make it easier but I have felt you  
Near all the way

The night-time shadows disappear  
And with them go all your tears  
But the morning will bring joy  
For every girl and boy, so  
Dont let the sun catch you crying  
  
They say that cryings not a bad thing  
But stop your crying when the birds sing  
  
It may be hard to discover  
That youve been left for another  
But dont forget that loves a game  
And it can always, always come again

Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
Too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life

Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way I feel  
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm  
But these cuts I have, they need love to help them heal  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
