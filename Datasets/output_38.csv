Insane Clown Posse,Play With Me,/i/insane+clown+posse/play+with+me_20067570.html,"(Children laughing, Toy cranks up)  
  
Hey (x54)  
  
(1st Verse- Violent J)  
Every year it's more of us and all we do is fill the box  
You might play with me at first, a couple days, a week at tops  
Just like your Atomic Supersonic Retro Plasma Car  
We will all get tossed inside just like the piece of shit we are  
I will be your fantasy imaginary special friend  
I can fill you ?? with you no need to talk to them  
But instead you toss me in the box, leave me to rott away  
Hoping you'll pick me again someday...hey, hey  
  
(Chorus- Violent J)  
Why don't you come play with me and take me to the other side[take me to the  
other side]  
Lost under Ann Raggedy it's lonely when your locked in side [It can be so  
lonley] (x2)  
  
(2nd Verse- Violent J)  
I will sit and listen to your bibble babble jibber talk  
But when you go in tonight you'll leave me out here on the walk  
You'll ignore your little friend or trade me for something instead  
Please come get your doggie, don't let him chew up my fucking leg  
All your mom and daddy do is work and fight, that's all they do!  
I can understand the way you feel because I feel it to  
But you'll leave me in the box and I can barley hear you play  
Lost umong the toys of yesterday, hey[hey]hey[hey]hey  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Shaggy2Dope)  
Boys and girls, fuck that old crusty shit  
Come down and get your brand new, ha, shiny  
slimy, atomic shithead  
  
[Super, duper!]  
[Right]  
[S-s-s-s-sonic, sonic]  
[Right]  
  
(3rd Verse- Violent J)  
I can see you near the bed when I look through this tiny crack  
You become much older now and I don't see you turning back  
Seven years in darkness I can only hope my wish comes true  
That one day I'll get you in my hands...AND I'LL PLAY WITH YOU!!

Insane Clown Posse,Prom Queen,/i/insane+clown+posse/prom+queen_20067715.html,"Won't you be my prom queen? (another morning)  
Won't you be my prom queen?  
Everybody has a real good time  
Won't you be my prom queen? (must take for my senior prom)  
Won't you be my prom queen?  
Everybody has a real good time  
Another morning, I must get up and go to school  
I'm taking too long gettin dressed, tryin to look my best  
Because today is not your ordinary every morning  
My high school prom is coming and I heave my daddy's warnings  
I'm going to find myself a girl to take to the prom  
I shouldn't have too much trouble because I'm  
I'm very nice, my mother says I'm very handsome  
When I wear my good vest, and mother knows best  
I got to school, I straggle through the hallways  
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always  
But this time, I must now approach them (or)  
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again (ow)  
And so I chose her, her hair, it matches with her face  
She is so lovely, my heart pulse begin to race  
I make my way between her friends and to her presence  
Hello, Christine, would you be my prom queen?  
I'd rather die, I'd rather die, I'd rather die... (repeat over)  
(would you be my prom queen? no! aaah! prom queen)  
There was a time when I could except a no  
That was before, Christine is gonna have to go  
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home  
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome  
Christine is famous, she has so many different friends  
Will they miss her when she's dead or will they just pretend  
Nobody talks to me, I only talk to I  
And I been telling myself all day, she's gotta die  
""Good morning, everybody. This is Principal Rogers, and I would just  
like to congradulate our Senior class and wish them at tonight's  
Prom dance.""  
Won't you be my prom queen? (I can be your prom baby)  
Won't you be my prom queen?  
Everybody has a real good time  
It was really fuckin easy, I'm a human hater  
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her  
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders  
And when it got dark, I caried her home on my shoulders  
My daddy was asleep, when I snuck her in the back  
I thought about my situation and it's kind of whack  
It sounds cheap, but we're having prom in my cellar  
But she's dead, I guess I'll never have to tell her  
I took the bottles of Tamiace, four dollars worth  
I took the seventeen dollars that was in her purse  
I bought balloons and streaming and stuff to munch  
I had a dollar left, I bought a Faygo Punch  
I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall  
I banged my head a couple times, I'm just too fuckin tall  
I would have took her to the school like a normal man  
But I had to kill her first they'd never understand  
I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance  
I bet she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants  
I know my daddy would be proud of all that I've done  
Instead of burning me, he'd probably come and hug his son  
I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat  
The more I think about it tears are rolling down my cheek  
I hope I showed Christine a night like no other  
After all, that's how my daddy did my mother  
""Our Seniors deserve a night to celebrate with friends, celebrate  
all their great work. Prom night is your very own special night,  
and everybody always remember their high school prom.""  
Won't you be my prom queen? (I can be your prom baby)  
Won't you be my prom queen?  
Everybody has a real good time

Insane Clown Posse,Radio Stars,/i/insane+clown+posse/radio+stars_20067590.html,"Occasionally, the overwhelming temptation to reach  
The pinnacle of the pop music genre, will reduce even  
The most deplorable examples of the underground music scene  
To attempt to change their so-called artistic endeavors, in a  
Vain attempt to appeal to the public at large.  
Behold, the metamorphosis  
  
Uh, fuck platinum, platinum just ain't enough  
We need more money, more house and cars and stuff  
I'm sick of juggalos, I want them other hoes

The moronic musical onslaught continues to insult  
The intelligence of the savvy consumer.  
How much more can an audience be asked to endure?  
  
Didn't work, ah fuck, what happened?  
They always told us that we sucked at rapping  
Well I don't know how to play a guitar  
I'll play the skin flute to be a radio star

Joey fell in love with a college girl  
She had a backpack and a pony tail  
She said her name was Lisa but I do not know,  
She drinks disco lemonade and cherry jello  
I can put my Buddy Holly glasses on  
I can even sing one of these faggot songs  
I can play in checkered pants and never smile  
Whatever's cool for your radio show  
Tommy fell in love with a college  
  
The borish, bumbling buffoons are baffled in their journey  
Through the music business. Each sonnet is more ridiculous  
Than the last. Their strides towards musical success are  
Little more than a stumble into complete failure.  
  
That was bullshit. What the fuck? You think of something!  
I'm sitting here trying to write hits, your doing nothing  
You wrote the crump shit, but did it work? No.  
It flopped on its ass. At least I tried though.  
Alright, ain't no need to be fighting with each other  
We need to start talking about relationships and lovers. Why?  
Can you sing? No. Neither can I.  
If we're gonna be radio stars, we at least gotta try.  
  
Correction, remix, uh, remix, Clownboy, uh, feel me  
Touch me, Clownboy, remix, uh  
Girl, I gotta let you know, on radio  
I want to lick you from head to toe  
Girl, your perfume, it's smelling so sweet  
I want to make love, between the sheets  
Girl, play my song, when I'm on the phone long  
I'm a radio man, and I know that I can't sing, yes I can  
Give me one more chance, and I'll make you dance  
Girl, we make radio songs, for radio fans, we can't go wrong

I like to suffocate people and bite their necks  
They got me in a place that ain't like the rest  
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck  
And it's sedatives...sedatives...like that  
Slow down, color smear all around  
Weird sounds, you in the mind of a clown  
And a wicked one somehow spinnin' around  
Wheel me down the hallway, arms strapped down  
With sedatives.  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Hangin' all out the neck from the IV  
Sedatives for the lively  
Study me, ask me, no answer  
I'm cuttin' your neck first chance sir  
[Violent J]  
White walls, white floor, small rooms  
After sedatives, they become ballrooms  
Crows fly by my window slow  
Headed that way but lookin' at me though  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I'm an accident, human malfunction at best  
And I'm lookin' at a scalpel diggin' into your chest  
If I could only move, but them sedatives  
You know they saving your life, them sedatives  
Some of these other patients are strong as hell  
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell  
But I took his sedatives, well I thought they were sedatives  
But they were only medatives.  
[Violent J]  
I fake pain, call 'em over and play dead  
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse lady's head  
High on sedatives again, put me in a tiny place  
Chin strap muzzle over my face  
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me  
I was sedated, and that's when it hit me  
The only time I'm at peace is when I ain't even there  
God tell me, why the fuck am I here?  
[Verse - Violent J]  
I want a lobotomy, no shock therapy  
Come clean me nurse, take care of me  
I suffocated the last 2 they sent in alone  
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone  
Recreation time, wheel me to the courtyard  
Four guards in white and they might be important  
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow  
Watch leaves flow, enjoy the sedative show  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Well I even have my very own room these days  
White straight jacket, padded walls and PJ's  
But there's so many ways and every stunt I pull  
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl  
For attention? maybe, not to mention a sedative  
Heard one guy say ""why even let it live?""  
There's probably no sedatives in Hell  
And that's the only reason I'm alive still!  
[Violent J]  
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that y'all  
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw  
A plastic straw, yet flimsy and weak  
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right..FREEEK!

Where the world is shaded in gray

When my faith is weathered and worn

And when my hamburgers cold,  
I get up ready to go,  
She's only 16 years old,

Taking orders from the  
Provo City Little League.  
If they knew how much I wanted her,  
Their home room teacher would have  
To send them home for a week.  
And when I head for the door, the  
Moonlight catches her eyes.  
My heart begins to soar, she smiles  
And waves goodbye. Goodbye

The riots up staging

To make amends

This hatred must be stopped

And the dead are breaking in

And then just hang your head  
Why not believe  
In the good of man  
Not bricks and burn  
Take all that you can  
To love your fellow man  
With all of your heart

Fifteen quid is all she asks for  
Everybody's got their vice  
  
If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece  
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free

In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Iron Maiden,Dance Of Death,/i/iron+maiden/dance+of+death_10145243.html,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones  
About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
I'd one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know you'll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess I'll never know  
Just why they let me go  
But I'll never go dancing no more  
'Til I dance with the dead

I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.

There's no time to prepare  
Salvage a last horizon  
But no regrets from me  
  
Maybe I'll be back some other day  
To live again just who can say  
In what shape or form that I might be  
Just another chance for me  
  
A hurried time no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusion  
And wishing all my life away

But there's more things I'd like to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Someday maybe I'll wait till then  
  
No more lies  
  
They're all sitting at my table  
Talking tall and drinking wine  
Their time is up just like me  
But they just don't know it yet  
  
So just a word of warning  
When you're in your deepest dreams  
There's nothing you can hide from  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The clock is fast, the hour is near  
Eventful past is ever clear  
My life is set, the time is here

His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
""Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
""One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one.""  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end.  
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and you're down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow.  
CHORUS  
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each

A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down  
The Angel of Death hears your last breath  
Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.

Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach

These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate

Your number's up, the bullet's got your name  
You still go on, to hell and back again

The warrior tombs, lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand, we will prevail

Too long I held you close to my heart  
Too much I loved you right from the start  
Too soon you vanished out of my dreams  
Too late to start all over it seems

It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me?  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But how about me?  
You'll find somebody new  
But what am I to do?  
I'll still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?

Moonlight was beaming down from the skies  
Lovelight was gleaming deep in your eyes  
Sunlight for just a moment and then  
Twilight and I was lonely again

As a child I went wild when a band played  
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed  
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply  
Divine  
But today when they play I could hiss them  
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system  
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

I love a piano, I love a piano

Upon a piano, a grand piano  
It simply carries me away  
  
I know a fine way to treat a steinway  
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories  
  
And with the pedal I love to meddle  
When padarewski comes this way  
I'm so delighted if I'm invited  
To hear that long haired genius play  
  
So you can keep your fiddle and your bow  
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh  
I love to stop right beside an upright  
Or a high toned baby grand

When a green tetrazine starts to warble  
I grow cold as an old piece of marble

We've been chasing up and down  
That other show has just left town  
And the one who played the clown  
Was a bad, bad man  
  
You may love us and leave us  
But the parting won't grieve us  
We'll turn the other cheek

When the show folks come to call  
A girl may slip but she won't fall  
We'll give some but won't give all

Play towns I could return to  
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak  
I'm glad you're not frightened  
The atmosphere has brightened  
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week  
  
Monday when my show is done  
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun  
You may find it lots of fun  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Tuesday there's no matinee  
But I'll be in my tent all day  
You can come around and play  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Send your mothers on Wednesday  
Because Wednesday's old hens' day  
But Thursday is sublime  
I'll have lots of open time  
  
Friday night will be the test  
If Saturday you're still my guest  
Sunday you can come and rest  
With a bad, bad man  
  
I'm enlightened but frightened  
Tho' my interest you've heightened  
It might turn out to be  
That you're much too much for me  
  
So I'll go back to my tent  
And someday when you're old and bent  
Think of hours you might have spent  
With a bad, bad man

See if you can stand  
The awful hurt I feel inside  
  
Put yourself in my place

Live through the loneliness  
The endless emptiness  
I go through  
  
And when you lose a little sleep at night  
Cause you ain't been treated right  
Then you know heartaches are sad  
Sitting by the telephone  
Being left all alone  
Then you know why I'm feeling bad  
Put yourself in my place  
  
And when you're just about to go insane  
Cause it hurts to love in vain  
Ask a girl who's been in love  
I believed your evil line  
Now I'm left alone and crying  
Alone to count the stars above

Depan pasar dekat terminal  
Pagi itu orang berkerumun  
Melihat mayat yang membusuk  
Tutup hidung sesekali meludah  
Aku lihat orang menangis  
Disela gaduhnya suasana  
Segera aku menghampiri  
Dengan bimbang ku bertanya padanya  
Rupanya yang mati sang teman  
Teman hitam hidup sepaham  
Hanya kisah yang dilewati  
Ia berdua ikat tali saudara  
Sementara surya mulai tinggi  
Panas terasa bakar kepala  
Sisa darah orang yang mati  
Disimpannya didalam hati  
Lalu dia seperti batu  
Sampai malam sampai semuanya pergi

How could you know? How could you know?

Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?  
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?

Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things  
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like

Father forgive me for me, childish ways  
I look outside and all the clouds are gray  
I need your hands to take me, miles away  
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but  
Before you go I've got to, want you now  
Whatever goes up surely, must come down  
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found  
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man

Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever  
Never, Rozay rich forever  
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever  
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight  
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked  
And just from life, knocking you on your ass  
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass  
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it  
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water  
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys  
Back in the days, I would've hated on the new boys  
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing  
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along  
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went  
A couple singles but could never be the main event  
Without substance, something for them to grab on  
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long  
I ain't even certain, one day they love you  
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you  
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you  
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you  
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train  
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane  
I pray to god end they reign  
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about  
And could've died when I came from disbelief  
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak

Tell J. Cole to meet us down in the A  
And bring Wiz Khalifa 'cause the green look pure  
We some real niggas, we just lookin' in the mirror  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
D.C. all up in this bitch, 'bout time I got my respect  
And now these hoes are on my line like Sally Mae on college deck  
Gotti here I'm in this shit, hey J. Cole come here this shit  
I bet you hear that white music but I don't mean top 40 hits  
  
Talk to the mirror and I don't need a cure  
And when I'm done with this muthafucker  
It'll need a urn shoppin' I'll be in Paris  
You plottin', don't even worry  
You walk in my closet your favorite style is some beaten birds  
  
You out where? We don't ever see ya  
My niggas out here they spot me like Chippy D.  
And I'm probably smokin' reefer till I got that emphysema  
How else can I emphasise I'll only let the mirror see ya  
  
It go microphone check, one, two, yola  
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar  
Two baby mama's, three kids, two Rovers  
That's too many problems, too late to think over  
  
The cars off the showroom, clothes off the mannequin  
Hoes off the centerfold, I be going ham at ten  
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling  
College girl goin' wild and Gotti be the camera man  
  
Bird talk feather man, Louis jacket, leatherman  
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant  
Man in the mirror if I can't get my shot again  
My bitch like a Coke bottle, yo' bitch like a Pepsi can  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'

Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror?  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall, bitch I was born to ball  
While y'all took the summer off, my money did a somersault  
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel  
Ain't no nigga touchin' my style it got a forcefield  
  
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo  
The view from my condo be makin' hoes say neato  
Game strong like the arm on Marino  
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos  
  
Fresh to death like I'm buried in a tuxedo  
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fuckin' ego  
I say it's yo' world, Cole World to be exact  
With a flow that's so thorough  
No sir, you can't reenact, nigga  
  
Hundred fifty on my chain, ballin' but it's not a game  
High that's why they call us planes  
All the bitches know my name  
I take 'em home fuck her, get high and never call again  
  
And my niggas all the same, now that's what you call a game  
Hundred thousand dollars and that's on champagne  
Bitches choose and they excuses my new car's to blame  
Wanna dump her nigga, fuck a nigga, with a lot of fame  
Don't want nothing from a nigga he all kinds of lame  
  
Try doin' what I'm doin' but it's out of range  
Niggas takin' shots, don't know how to aim  
Don't know 'bout you but I see a real nigga  
When I'm lookin' in the mirror with some diamonds in my ear  
Motherfucker  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror

Hey, I know that this aint nothing that you used to  
Out of the ordinary, unusual  
I know you had your whole life planed out  
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you  
I know you wonder why I had to choose you  
Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you  
So I'mma keep it honest  
I think it's a little ironic  
If I hit another chick it's gonna bruise you  
Shit, staring out the window of this plane  
Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again  
Wouldn't that be a shame  
Cause look at all the shit we overcame  
Made it through the falme and never got cremated  
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded  
All them other couples we f-ck with, secretly hated  
Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it  
Sh-t remember I was straying from home  
And where I wanna be was my favourite song  
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones  
But I just can't leave you alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
She know me like a book, it's too easy to read my ass  
Unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass  
I mean I make it so easy don't please my ass  
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass  
It's true that, true that  
My song all on the radio  
Who Dat!  
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on  
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on  
All this time I've been with ya you aint used to do that  
I loved you ass way before I knew you could wrap  
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that  
Calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that  
We had a deal you aint keeping up your end of the shit  
In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick  
Trying justify it, man we finna be rich  
And some bad b-tch I barely know sending me flix

Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars  
I was David promising the world that ima serve Goliath  
Then I swam with sharks,

Take notes make money don't make jokes  
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats

You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off

Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no

Game colder than the fuckin' dead man

No bridesmaids, or reverends

No role models and I'm here right now  
No role models to speak of  
Searchin' through my memory, my memory  
I couldn't find one  
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed  
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God  
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?""  
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""  
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood  
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods  
Ain't got no shame bout it  
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch  
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""  
But then I thought back, back to a better me  
Before I was a B-list celebrity  
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily  
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody  
You wasn't sweatin' me  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her

I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love  
That Jada and that Will love  
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love  
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love  
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows  
Out of touch with reality hoes  
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes  
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door  
Nigga you know how it go  
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap  
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back  
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave  
I'ma need my shirt back  
Nigga you know how it go  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in
Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.  
If you fool me we can't get fooled again  
  
Fool me one time shame on you  
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you  
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs  
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet  
My only regret was too young for Nia Long  
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows  
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along  
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu  
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home  
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone  
With the stale face cause they know it's they song

I tried, you tried, we tried  
All of the times that we had together  
We should of known nothing last forever(X2)  
  
[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly  
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me  
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me  
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me  
Soon as this shit end, forget about it  
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it  
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it  
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it  
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'  
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?  
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass  
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama  
On my mama, we been through it all  
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall  
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst  
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
They say we won't last  
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask  
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell  
A good nigga gone bad  
Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough  
I be, out here tryna raise my status up  
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck  
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist  
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste  
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you  
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you  
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'  
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you  
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start  
But deep down you know we grew apart  
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect  
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile  
Apologies, I ain't been around  
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now  
And times have changed  
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?  
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it  
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it  
Now we can say that all good things come to an end  
But we know each other way too well to pretend  
We went from friends to somethin' much more  
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more  
Second chances, we gave enough to finally  
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more  
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather  
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better  
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me  
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

Look in my rear view all I see is n-ggas headlights  
Catch me if you can hoe  
They try and sack me and I scramble  
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo  
Hey, don't you see me man?  
Making my wishes come true with no genie man  
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man  
I'm on these rich n-ggas ass no bikini man  
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man  
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man  
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope  
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost  
Silly head to approach, what's up young blood  
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change  
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city  
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me  
Than I surely woulda died

Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me

Send her back to you when she no longer excites me  
No she bitter with this n-gga

Two things for f-cking sure  
I am not the husband thoguh  
So run back to him while you still can  
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah that's a real man  
I was ashamed all along and I still am

And Rnb b-tches want me, that was just dreams before  
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'  
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'  
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong  
Plus my d-ck is like a man with a mind of it's own  
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about sh-t

Looking for chesse on some mouse sh-t  
Suck a n-gga, f-ck a n-gga, than go run they mouth quick  
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit  
You want change, this that ""between the seats in your couch"" sh-t

All that flame on my name would get exhausted  
Au contraire my n-gga they all ears  
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah

And it was easy then to say what love could do  
It's so easy when your world is new  
  
It's been so hard sometimes to find my way  
I let my pleasure lead my little world astray  
And if I'm truthful I'll say that I was blind  
To everything about this life but what I had in mind  
  
And it was easy then to say where love could go  
It's so easy when there's so much you don't know  
  
About my imagination, it got me through somehow  
Without my imagination, I wouldn't be here now  
  
And it was easy then when love was guaranteed  
It's so easy when love is all you need  
  
About my imagination  
I'm making this investigation  
Into my imagination  
According to my computations  
We're overdue for a transformation  
Or is it my imagination?  
  
I keep my eyes open and try to see  
This life in terms of possibility  
With so much changing, and changing for the worse  
You got to keep your head up, Baby  
From the cradle to the hearse  
  
And it was easy then to say where love could go  
It's so easy when love is all you know  
  
About my imagination  
I'm getting ready for the celebration  
I'm bringing my imagination  
Taking charge of my elevation  
No fear, no trepidation  
Register my affirmation  
No doubt, no hesitation  
People get ready for the embarkation  
  
About my imagination  
Calling out across the nation  
It's time for some kind of re-dedication  
Not talking 'bout just my generation  
I'm sending out this invocation  
I keep getting these excitations  
More light, more love  
More truth, and more innovation

Jackson Browne,"Ah, But Sometimes",/j/jackson+browne/ah+but+sometimes_20068663.html,"I'm a moody and swirling pool, lost in some dark wood  
Angry at a million things and more  
I can do no good  
Ah, but sometimes -  
  
Sometimes I'm a growing blade of grass  
Washed by the rain, bent by the wind  
  
I'm a deeply wounded lonely tree  
Lost in my own way  
Brooding on the saddest things and worse  
I've seen my better day  
  
I'm an old and broken tumbleweed  
Lost on faded sands  
Dreaming of my yesterdays before  
I watch the heat waves dance

With the hopeful and the willing  
With the open and the strong  
With the voices in the darkness  
Fashioning daylight out of song  
And the millions of lovers  
Alive in the world  
  
I want to live in the world, not behind some wall  
I want to live in the world, where I will hear if another voice should call  
To the prisoner inside me  
To the captive of my doubt  
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out  
And taking his chances  
Alive in the world

To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world  
  
With its beauty and its cruelty  
With its heartbreak and its joy  
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy  
And the infinite power of change  
Alive in the world

Jackson Browne,Before The Deluge,/j/jackson+browne/before+the+deluge_20068553.html,"Some of them were dreamers  
And some of them were fools  
Who were making plans and thinking of the future  
With the energy of the innocent  
They were gathering the tools  
They would need to make their journey back to nature  
While the sand slipped through the opening  
And their hands reached for the golden ring  
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge  
In the troubled years that came before the deluge  
  
Some of them knew pleasure  
And some of them knew pain  
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered  
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth  
They went flying around in the rain  
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered  
And in the end they traded their tired wings  
For the resignation that living brings  
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow  
For the glitter and the rouge  
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky  
  
Some of them were angry  
At the way the earth was abused  
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power  
And they struggled to protect her from them  
Only to be confused  
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour  
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived  
In the naked dawn only a few survived  
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge  
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Where the grace and simple truth of childhood go  
Don't you want to be there when the trumpets blow  
  
Blow for those born into hunger  
Blow for those lost 'neath the train  
Blow for those choking in anger  
Blow for those driven insane  
  
And those you have wronged, you know  
You need to let them know some way  
And those who have wronged you, know  
You'll have to let them go someday  
  
Don't you want to be there?  
Don't you want to see where the angels appear  
Don't you want to be where there's strength and love  
In the place of fear

They were duelin' Doolin-Dalton  
High or low it was the same  
Easy money an' faithless women  
Redeye whiskey for the pain  
  
Go down Bill Dalton it must be God's will  
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville  
Two voices call to you from were they stood  
Lay down your law books now they're no damn good  
  
Better keep on movin' Doolin-Dalton  
'Til your shadow sets you free  
An' if you're fast an' if you're lucky  
You will never see that hangin' tree  
  
Old towns lay out across the dusty plains  
Like graveyards filled with tomb stones waitin' for the names  
And a man could his back or use his brains  
But some just went stir crazy Lord 'cause nothin' ever changed  
  
'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton  
He was workin' cheap just bidin' time  
An' then he laughed and said I'm going  
And so he left that peaceful life behind

The lawmen cleared the people from the street  
All you blood thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seat  
  
Watch 'em duelin', Doolin-Dalton  
High or low its all the same  
Easy money an' faithless women  
You will never kill the pain  
  
Go down Bill Doolin don't you wonder why  
Sooner or later we all have to die  
Sooner or later that's a stone cold fact  
Four men ride out and only three ride back

Working downtown  
Downtown, they got to think a little quicker  
'Cause they're downtown  
Downtown, the breaks are harder  
Downtown, the thieves are smarter  
I've got this place I'm renting  
It cost me next to nothing, downtown  
Nobody comes around telling me  
I gotta turn the sound down  
Broadway, down on the corner  
The Bible screamer, the plasma donor  
Buses, car horns, ghetto blasters  
The shouts and cries of the human disasters  
It's all music  
It's all music  
Downtown  
It's all music  
It's all music  
I feel alright when I'm downtown  
My feet are light when I'm downtown  
I cast my hopes on the human tide  
I place my bet and let it ride  
I'm open wide when I'm downtown  
Downtown, there's every kind of people  
Walkin' 'round downtown  
Downtown, there's every language  
Every human sound, downtown  
Downtown, the nights are longer  
Downtown, the sights are stronger  
Downtown, wandering all around, downtown  
It's all music  
Eight blocks south of city hall  
The rats run free and the winos crawl  
Darkness falls on the vast machine  
Where the future stalks the American dream

My head feels light when I'm downtown  
It's all in sight when I'm downtown

Jackson Browne,Enough Of The Night,/j/jackson+browne/enough+of+the+night_20068694.html,"You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You used to stop trucks on aisle 19  
In your blue leopard tights  
You got the vote of your high school  
Most likely to exceed  
But not likely to ever get enough  
Enough of what you need  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
And now the carnival lights come down  
The sounds of laughter recede  
You sit and drink in this cardboard town  
The fast lane gone to seed  
You used to laugh about the damage done  
But there was no way to know  
How little distance you had actually come  
And how far you'd have to go  
It's tough to do baby, it's tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
It's tough for you baby, it's tough for me too  
Without all this pain to see through  
Now I want to see you smile  
You know how it's just been awhile  
Don't allow another night to close  
On your empty cup, you've had enough of those  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
You used to count on the miracles  
The old shot in the dark  
You used to wait for the setting sun  
To help you hit your mark  
You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You dressed right out of the fables, baby  
Like the Arabian Nights  
But you were never the princess  
More like the queen of the thieves  
And my heart was never more than one of the many  
A queen receives  
It's tough to do baby, it's tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
It's tough for you baby, it's tough for me too  
Without this disdain to see through  
Now, I want to see you smile  
You know how, it's just been awhile  
Don't allow another heart to pass  
Beyond your reach, say baby not so fast, hey baby not so fast  
You've had enough of the night  
To fill the street with tears  
You've had enough of those empty hours  
To last a thousand years  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of tears  
She got enough of the night  
She had enough of the tears, baby  
She had enough of night  
She got enough of, had enough of the night  
She got enough of, bop bop baby  
You got enough of night  
You had enough of tears, bop bop bop

Jackson Browne,Everywhere I Go,/j/jackson+browne/everywhere+i+go_20068534.html,"I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be in love  
The way I forget what we're speaking of  
The way I stand there smiling straight ahead  
And walk away without hearing a word they said  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
In the middle of the football game  
At the beach in the pouring rain  
Standing on a hillside staring at the sun  
People hurry by the unfortunate one  
With the faraway eyes and the mystery smile  
Moving my body in a ragamuffin style  
I can't sit down when I hear it start  
I hear your heart everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be a fool  
Cause when I'm near you I cannot be cool  
I don't quite make sense when I talk to you  
And when you smile I forget everything I knew  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
Standing in the market where I buy my bread  
With a hunger in my belly and a rhythm in my head  
Looking all around for something good to eat  
Between the butter and the beans and the mops and the meat  
Coffee from the mountain, honey from the bee  
Nothing tastes as good as you taste to me  
Rocking in the aisle to my inside song  
People staring at me think I got a Walkman on  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
Beating everywhere I go

Jackson Browne,Farther On,/j/jackson+browne/farther+on_20068554.html,"In my early years i hid my tears  
And passed my days alone  
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness  
My dreams like nets were thrown  
To catch the love that I'd heard of  
In books and films and songs  
Now there's a world of illusion and fantasy  
In the place where the real world belongs  
  
Still i look for the beauty in songs  
To fill my head and lead me on  
Though my dreams have come up torn and empty  
As many times as love has come and gone  
  
To those gentle ones my memory runs  
To the laughter we shared at the meals  
I filled their kitchens and living rooms  
With my schemes and my broken wheels  
It was never clear how far or near  
The gates to my citadel lay  
They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own  
But they listened to mine anyway  
  
I'm not sure what i'm trying to say  
It could be i've lost my way  
Though i keep a watch over the distance  
Heaven's no closer than it was yesterday  
  
And the angels are older  
They know not to wait up for the sun  
They look over my shoulder  
At the maps and the drawings of the journey I've begun  
  
Now the distance leads me farther on  
Though the reasons i once had are gone  
I keep thinking I'll find what I'm looking for  
In the sand beneath the dawn  
  
But the angels are older  
They can see that the sun's setting fast  
They look over my shoulder  
At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past  
And they lay down behind me  
To sleep beside the road till the morning has come  
Where they know they will find me  
With my maps and my faith in the distance  
Moving farther on

That I was just another part of their plan  
I went off looking for the promise  
Believing in the Motherland  
And from the comfort of a dreamer's bed  
And the safety of my own head  
I went on speaking of the future  
While other people fought and bled  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasn't quite as sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
It's in my blood and in my bones  
By the dawn's early light  
By all I know is right  
We're going to reap what we have sown  
  
As if freedom was a question of might  
As if loyalty was black and white  
You hear people say it all the time-  
""My country wrong or right""  
I want to know what that's got to do  
With what it takes to find out what's true  
With everyone from the President on down  
Trying to keep it from you  
  
The thing I wonder about the Dads and Moms  
Who send their sons to the Vietnams  
Will they really think their way of life  
Has been protected as the next war comes?  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
Her shining dream plays in my mind  
By the rockets red glare  
A generation's blank stare  
We better wake her up this time  
  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasn't quite a sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
I can't let go till she comes around  
Until the land of the free  
Is awake and can see  
And until her conscience has been found

Tears of laughter, tears of grief, are they the tears of a captured thief?  
You thought that you were home free, you thought you had her well in hand  
But there were things about her you didn't understand  
Yeah Baby, tell me how you're gonna keep that promise now?  
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get  
You didn't then, but now you know  
When she began to lie, you really should have let her go  
You're learnin' how to talk about it, you're learnin' how to bend  
It's like you're learning how to walk all over again  
Yeah Baby, tell me who you're gonna give your lovin' to?  
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by  
You set it by her soulful smile, the fire in her eye  
And the way she goes that extra mile  
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line  
You'll find her eventually  
Your grandma and her grandma are sittin' 'round heaven discussin' the law  
Lovin' that girl was not your crime, livin' without her gonna take some time

I was taken by a photograph of you  
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more  
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true  
  
You were turning 'round to see who was behind you  
And I took your childish laughter by surprise  
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you  
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes  
  
Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small  
Though it hasn't really been that long a time  
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all  
Although for a while, our path did seem to climb  
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger  
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool  
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger  
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right  
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams  
But that magic feeling never seems to last  
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems  
It would be easier sometimes to change the past  
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you  
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school  
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you  
There's this loneliness springing up from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
  
You've had to hide sometimes but now you're all right  
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight  
To keep understanding and compassion in sight  
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right  
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright

But she wasn't letting on  
That she was grieving  
  
She's bound to go  
Perhaps she'll find him waiting  
For his boat in some city far away  
She's bound to go  
  
Lately I remember  
Afternoons of smoke and wine  
There was nothing we could find  
But peace and pleasure  
And with a smile he told me  
That he wanted just to be on his way  
Across the sea no man can measure  
  
He won't be back,  
And the sun may find him sleeping  
In the dust of some ruin far away  
He won't be back  
  
Early today as I watched while  
The skyline was shaking  
I heard a rumbling  
Early today the mechanical city was waking  
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling  
Out through the laughter  
Of children and dogs  
  
Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that  
He can't breathe here  
Did you see his lady  
She was reaching for his hand  
Just as if to tell her man  
That she can't either  
  
They're bound to go  
And the sun may find me running after them,  
Seeing something far away  
We won't be back

.....Suddenly came back today  
.....And I allowed him home today into my mind  
.....For a moment face to face  
.....Evil packed upon the place  
.....Long ago he meant to stay out there this time  
.....Oh, what do you know  
.....The love that I've been feeling  
.....The past is healing so slow  
.....By tomorrow, gone from sorrow.

Melodies dedicated to the seasons

Remembering a reason not to sing  
  
And the music would accompany  
The words it brings along  
Why should I try  
How can I try  
I can't give you the seasons in a song

A picture with a swirling world of color

All the memories of all my failures  
Would be summoned in  
And made to walk a step or two behind  
  
And models seldom find themselves  
In portraits that I've drawn  
But I have cried  
And not denied  
That my colors aren't clear enough in song  
  
You ask of me  
What's a word that rhymes with all your confusion  
Don't you think that's just a little bit  
Unusual to ask  
  
Once you asked of me  
Once before what is a word for all your crying

All my daydreams at a thousand miles an hour

Into an order if I can

Before I come and talk to you again  
Well I'll meet you in a dream or two  
Down by the borderland

They say you'll fall in no time at all  
But you know they're wrong  
Known it all along  
  
Hold on hold out, keep a hold on still  
If you don't see what your love is worth  
No one ever will  
You've done your time on the bottom line  
  
And it ain't no thrill  
There's got to be something more  
Keep a hold on still  
You know what it is you're waiting for  
  
Now you just hold on  
Hold on hold out, hold on  
  
Give up your heart and you lose your way  
Trusting another to feel that way  
Give up your heart and you find yourself  
Living for something in somebody else

Sometimes the touch of a friend is enough  
  
Hold a place for the human race  
Keep it open wide  
Give it time to fall or climb  
But let the time decide  
  
Sometimes you wonder what's in this for you  
But you wait, and you see  
'Cause it's all you can do  
Just to hold on  
Hold on hold out, hold on  
  
For the countless souls beaten by their goals  
Keep a hold on now  
And the ones betrayed by the deals they made  
Keep a hold on

Keep a hold somehow  
  
Hold on hold out, keep a hold on tight

Wake up and turn on the light  
You fight, and you're right--  
It's gonna take all your might...

It seems I've traded love for glory  
But I'm still not satisfied  
  
Given all the years  
All the cries and cheers  
Don't amount to much more than pride  
Take my love for you  
Take tomorrow too  
There's not much left inside  
  
How we laughed when we first knew love  
Singing dumb-de-lum-de-lie  
I taught you how to see life through love  
Then I taught you how to cry  
And though I must have known  
How easily love is thrown  
I took some chances, I don't know why  
There's not much you can do  
You wish that I'd been true  
Darlin' so do I  
  
Now you better hold out  
Go on and hold out  
Go ahead and hold out  
For what you know love can be  
Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
If there's anyone who knows about it  
Baby that's me  
  
Ah you're right  
You can't forget the way I lied  
Time has seen you grow,  
To lead your life alone  
Though you tried and tried  
Cried and cried  
  
Baby I guess you know my story  
Maybe there's not much left to say  
You know the more we take the more we  
Turn each other's hearts away  
Now I'll be leaving in the morning  
Leaving half of me behind  
To find the pieces life's been torn in  
And take whatever love I find  
  
But you better hold out  
Go on and hold out  
Just walk away and hold out  
For what you know love can be  
Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
It's starting to be cold out  
For people who live like me  
Move on and hold out  
And somewhere later no doubt  
You'll find another hold out  
Someone just like you baby, wait and see

And how long will we hear people speaking  
About missiles for peace  
And just let it go by  
How long will they tell us these weapons  
Are keeping us free

If you saw it from a satellite  
With its green and its blue and white  
The beauty of the curve of the earth  
And its oceans below

But it's turning so slow

Of my tires in the rain  
Youre the hidden cost and the thing thats lost

Chasing songs from town to town

Alone within the boundaries of my mind

But who are the ones that we call our friends?  
These governments killing their own?  
Or the people who finally can't take anymore  
And they pick up a gun or a brick or a stone  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire  
  
There's a shadow on the faces  
Of the men who fan the flames  
Of the wars that are fought in places  
Where we can't even say the names  
  
They sell us the president the same way  
They sell us our clothes and our cars  
They sell us everything from youth to religion  
The same time they sell us our wars  
  
I want to know who the men in the shadows are  
I want to hear somebody asking them why  
They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are  
But they're never the ones to fight or to die  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire

Jackson Browne,Looking East,/j/jackson+browne/looking+east_20068583.html,"Standing in the ocean with the sun burning low in the west  
Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast  
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest  
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east  
  
Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod  
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God  
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast  
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage  
In the absence of light  
And the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east  
  
How long have I left my mind to the powers that be?  
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me?  
  
Power in the insect  
Power in the sea  
Power in the snow falling silently  
Power in the blossom  
Power in the stone  
Power in the song being sung alone  
Power in the wheat field  
Power in the rain  
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane  
Power in the silence  
Power in the flame  
Power in the sound of the lover's name  
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released  
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age  
And an absence of light  
In the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east

Love needs a heart and I need to find  
If loves needs a heart like mine  
  
Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me

Love needs a heart, trusting and blind

I can cry with the best I can laugh with the rest  
But I'm never sure when it's real  
And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done  
But apart from all that I hope to find  
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?

And the soul of the friend begins  
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one  
And a struggle neither wins  
  
Where you gave me the world I was in  
And a place I could make a stand  
I could never see how you doubted me  
When I'd let go of your hand  
  
Yeah, and I was much younger then  
And I must have thought that I would know  
If things were going to end  
  
And the heavens were rolling  
Like a wheel on a track  
And our sky was unfolding  
And it'll never fold back  
Sky blue and black  
  
And I'd have fought the world for you  
If I thought that you wanted me to  
Or put aside what was true or untrue  
If I'd know that's what you needed  
What you needed me to do  
  
But the moment has passed by me now  
To have put away my pride  
And just come through for you somehow  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name, I'll be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back, I'll see you through  
  
You're the color of the sky  
Reflected in each store-front window pane  
You're the whispering and the sighing  
Of my tires in the rain  
  
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost  
In everything I do  
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you  
In the sunlight and the shadows  
  
And the faces on the avenue  
That's the way love is  
That's the way love is  
That's the way love is  
Sky blue and black

And people die for the little things  
A little corn, a little beans

And I'm alive  
Carrying your smile with me

Everywhere I look I see this world slippin' down  
That low road, day by day  
And I just go on working for the things I need  
And making my own way  
Carrying your smile with me, oh yea  
Carrying your smile with me  
  
Take a walk on the troubled side of this old town  
Take a walk on the broken streets and the buildings falling down  
Look at all these kids with nothing but trouble in their eyes  
Trouble in their future, trouble in their lives  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Take a walk on the shaded uptown avenue  
Some people are doing well no matter how they do  
And I know there's more to life than what you own  
But I see so many good things, things I've never known  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Every night I listen to the sound of the street  
Lying in my bed  
I love to see the dreams that are dancing there  
In the light above your head  
And sometimes I get so weary  
And when hope is caving in  
You fill me with your love and your laughter, baby  
Until I get back up again  
  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk on the streets of this divided town)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk on the smoking edge of the battleground)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a look at the situation, the poverty and the desperation)  
(Take the time for the realization)  
Everyday I'm carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk in the daylight)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Some bridges are falling down)  
Carrying your smile with me

I did not know him well  
He was alone into his distance  
He was deep into his well  
I could guess what he was laughing at,  
But I couldn't really tell  
Now the story's told that Adam jumped,  
But I've been thinking that he fell  
  
Together we went traveling,  
As we received the call  
His destination India,  
And I had none at all  
Well, I still remember laughing  
With our backs against the wall  
So free of fear, we never thought  
That one of us might fall  
  
I sit before my only candle,  
But it's so little light to find my way  
Now this story unfolds before my candle  
Which is shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
But I feel just like a candle in the way  
I guess I'll get there, but  
I wouldn't say for sure  
  
When we parted we were laughing still,  
As our goodbyes were said  
And I never heard from him again  
As each our lives we led  
Except for once in someone else's  
Letter that I read  
Until I heard the sudden word  
That a friend of mine was dead  
  
I sit before my only candle,  
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way  
Now this journey appears before my candle  
As a song that's growing fainter  
The harder that I play  
But I fear before I end I'll fade away  
But I guess I'll get there,  
Though I wouldn't say for sure  
  
Though Adam was a friend of mine,  
I did not know him long  
And when I stood myself beside him,  
I never though I was as strong  
Still it seems he stopped his singing  
In the middle of his song  
Well I'm not the one to say I know,  
But I'm hoping he was wrong  
  
I'm holding out my only candle,  
Though it's so little light to find my way  
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle  
And it's shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way  
I hope I'll get there,  
But I never pray

Going crazier every day  
Watching our love slipping away  
  
'Cause you're the only home I've ever wanted  
And the only light I've known

Some people go through life seeing just what they want to see  
Take the way I went on believing  
You might still believe in me  
And I still want the love I always thought our love could be  
But some things can't be changed  
Take this rain  
  
You're going to hear my voice in the morning calling your name  
And know my love and my desperation were one and the same  
And where our footprints used to be  
There'll be nothing but the sea  
And the tide and the wind and the open sky  
And the unbroken horizon  
  
Baby it's alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
It's alright  
Take this pain and all this sadness  
  
It's alright  
Make this rain into your fortress

And the houses filling up with light  
Between the stillness in my heart

Somebody's calling after somebody  
Somebody turns the corner out of sight  
Looking for somebody  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night

Tender are the motions, tender is the night  
Between a life that we expected  
And the way it's always been  
I can't walk back in again  
After the way we fight  
When just outside there are people laughing  
Living lives we used to lead  
Chasing down the love they need  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night  
And the benediction of the neon light  
Tender are the hunters, tender is the night  
You're gonna want me tonight  
When you're ready to surrender  
Forget about who's right  
When you're ready to remember  
It's another world at night  
When you're ready to be tender  
Tender, tender tender  
And in the hard light of an angry sun  
No one remembers what was said or done  
Tender are the words they choose  
You win, I win, we lose  
Tender  
Tender is the night  
Tender  
The benediction of the neon light

She could of turned out to be almost anyone  
Almost anyone  
With the possible exception  
Of who I wanted her to be  
Running into the midnight  
With her clothes whipping in the wind  
Reaching into the heart of the darkness  
For the tenderness within  
Stumblin' into the lights of the city  
And then back in the shadows again  
Hanging onto the laughter  
That each of us hid our unhappiness in  
Talk about celestial bodies  
And your angels on the wing  
She wasn't much good at stickin' around but  
She could sing.  
In the dead of night  
She could shine a light  
On some places that you've never been  
In that kind of light  
You could lose your sight  
And believe there was something to win  
You could hold her tight  
With all your might  
But she'd slip through your arms like the wind  
And be back in flight  
Back into the night  
Where you might never see her again  
The longer I thought I could find her  
The shorter my vision became  
Running in circles behind her  
And thinking in terms of the blame  
But she couldn't have been any kinder  
If she'd come back and tried to explain  
She wasn't much good at saying goodbye--but  
That girl was sane

Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear  
  
Now to see things clear it's hard enough I know  
While you're waiting for reality to show  
Without dreaming of the perfect love  
And holding it so far above  
That if you stumbled onto someone real, you'd never know

(that you might recognize)  
Afraid that all these words might scare you away

No one ever talks about their feelings anyway  
Without dressing them in dreams and laughter  
I guess it's just too painful otherwise  
  
Look  
It's like you're standing in the window  
Of a house nobody lives in  
And I'm sitting in a car across the way

It's an early model chevrolet

It's a warm and windy day  
You go and pack your sorrow  
The trash man comes tomorrow  
Leave it at the curb and we'll just roll away

Night in my eyes, the night inside me  
There where the shadows and the night could hide me  
Night in my eyes  
Sky full of stars turning over me  
Waiting for night to set me free

I wasn't sure there was a name for the life I sought

Waiting for night  
  
It takes the night to clear all of this mess away  
The obligation, the burden and the light of day  
It takes the night to fall between the world I obey  
And a world where I hear angels play  
Maybe I should go back to Spain  
  
I walk around inside the questions of my day  
I navigate the inner reaches of my disarray  
I pass the altars where fools and thieves hold sway  
I wait for night to come and lift this dread away  
  
Night in my eyes, the night inside me  
Here where the shadows and the light divide me  
Night in my eyes

Get it up again

And struggle for the legal tender

And believe in whatever may lie  
In those things that money can buy

And the merchants' windows are all bright  
With the faces of the children  
And the families hurrying to their homes  
As the sky darkens and freezes  
Will be gathering around their hearths and tables  
Giving thanks for all god's graces  
And the birth of the rebel Jesus  
  
Well they call him by the prince of peace  
And they call him by the savior  
And they pray to him upon the seas  
And in every bold endeavor  
As they fill his churches with their pride and gold  
And their faith in him increases  
But they've turned the nature that I worship in  
From a temple to a robber's den  
In the words of the rebel Jesus  
  
We guard our world with locks and guns  
And we guard our fine possessions  
And once a year when Christmas comes  
We give to our relations  
And perhaps we give a little to the poor  
If the generosity should seize us  
But if any one of us should interfere  
In the business of why they are poor  
They get the same as the rebel jesus  
  
But please forgive me if I seem  
To take the tone of judgement  
For I've no wish to come between  
This day and your enjoyment  
In this life of hardship and of earthly toil  
We have need for anything that frees us  
So I bid you pleasure  
And I bid you cheer  
From a heathen and a pagan  
On the side of the rebel jesus.

Jackson Browne,The Word Justice,/j/jackson+browne/the+word+justice_20068699.html,"A man stands up before his God and country  
Raises his right hand and takes an oath  
Swears he has acted in the line of duty  
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth  
But there is a need to keep somethings a secret  
Some weapons shipments, some private wars  
In the future democracy will be defended  
Behind closed doors  
Now the men of Congress who convene to determine  
If covert war is a business or a crime  
Are the same men who routinely give their permission  
For the shedding of blood in security's name  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The names of some countries, the terms of some deals  
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent  
Beneath our wheels  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?  
In the streets of America the children are buried  
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs  
They live and they die in the bowels of a business  
That disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source  
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through  
I am waiting for the time to come  
When the word will be real for everyone  
And not just a word but a thing that can be done  
Justice must be won  
Oh, oh, oh justice  
Justice  
Justice  
Oh, oh, oh justice  
Justice

He blew in off the water.  
My father was a farmer and I,  
His only daughter.  
Took up with a no good millworking man  
From Massachusetts  
Who dies from too much whiskey  
And leaves me these three faces to feed.  
  
Millwork ain't easy, millwork ain't hard,  
Millwork it ain't nothing  
But an awful boring job.  
I'm waiting for a daydream  
To take me through the morning  
And put me in my coffee break  
Where I can have a sandwich and remember.  
  
Then it's me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning,  
For the rest of the afternoon  
And the rest of my life.  
  
Now my mind begins to wander  
To the days back on the farm.  
I can see my father smiling at me,  
Swinging on his arm.  
I can hear my granddad's stories  
Of the storms out on Lake Erie  
Where vessels and cargoes and fortunes  
And sailors' lives were lost.  
  
Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,  
And I have been the fool  
To let this manufacturer  
Use my body for a tool.  
I can ride home in the evening,  
Staring at my hands,  
Swearing by my sorrow  
That a young girl  
Ought to stand a better chance.  
  
So may I work the mills  
Just as long as I am able  
And never meet the man  
Whose name is on the label.  
  
It be me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning  
And the rest of the afternoon,  
Gone for the rest of my life.

And in the name of flood control  
They made their plans and they drained the land

James Taylor,The Promised Land,/j/james+taylor/the+promised+land_20069343.html,"Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound and rode it into Raleigh and on across Caroline.  
We stopped in Charlotte but we bypassed Rockhill, we never was a minute late.  
We were ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown rolling out of Georgia state.  
Had some motor trouble that turned into a struggle half way across Alabam.  
That hound broke and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.  
So right away I bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi
clean,  
And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham smoking into New Orleans.  
Someone's got to help me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston
town.  
There's an uncle there who cares a little about me and he won't let the poor
boy down.  
Sure as you're born, he bought me a silk suit, put some luggage in my hand.  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land.  
Working on a T-Bone steak, a la carte, flying over to the Golden State.  
When the pilot told us that in thirteen minutes he would have us at the
terminal gate.  
Swing down chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal dome.  
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone.  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-O-nine.  
Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling,  
And the poor boy is on the line.

Well I left my job  
About five o'clock,  
It took fifteen minutes  
To go three blocks,  
Just in time  
To stand in line  
With a freeway looking  
Like a parking lot.

Now I almost had  
A heart attack,  
Looking in my rear view mirror,  
I saw myself

Looking in the rear view mirror,  
About to have  
A heart attack, I said,

It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Now when I die  
I don't want no coffin,  
I thought about it  
All too often.  
Just strap me in  
Behind the wheel  
And bury me with  
My automobile.

Running around  
On fossil fuel,  
Until I saw

The road to ruin.

Even in the middle of your sadness,  
The everyday madness, the ongoing game.  
Even when you can't find a reason,  
Still there is a reason,  
You don't need to name it.  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
  
Oh, even for a minute to find yourself in it,  
To wait by the stream to drop out of your dream,  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
Look up from your life, up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.

I kept thinking, Janis, why are you doing wrong suddenly ?  
Well I so decided to get up one morning, ha ha ha,  
And check out the chick's action, right,  
Figure out what she had going that I didn't have going.  
  
I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.  
And I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
I hid in the stairwell right next  
To the chick's across from her apartment, right.  
And I watched her and watched to see what she had, man,  
That I didn't have.  
  
And I'll tell you what she had man,  
That chick hit the streets at noon.  
I mean I didn't use to get up till three.  
That chick was already in the street hustling, man.  
So I figured out what you gotta do, man.

Oh ? er, er, er, I have no immediate plans, ha ha ha!!  
Did you entertain in high school, at the high school, when you went back at
the high school ?  
Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a
painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.  
What happened ?  
I got liberated! I don't know, I just started to sing and singing makes you
want to come out because painting, I feel, keeps you inside, you know ? and
once you start singing you just sort of wa

more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.  
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?  
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?  
Did they make you different ?  
No.  
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them, or were you ?  
I felt apart from them.  
Did you take a part in football games ?  
I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom, and er ...

Oh the second thing I would do is I would close both of my eyes  
And sing the parts I knew of favorite songs up to the sky.  
I go where I know the love is centering that look inside  
Gathering new strength from sorrow,  
I'm glad to be alive.  
  
I keep it calm around me.  
I'm safe inside my storm.  
I'm seeing all is grounding.  
Cause on the ground you can't get no lower.

Jason Mraz,Bella Luna,/j/jason+mraz/bella+luna_20537341.html,"Mystery the moon  
A hole in the sky  
A supernatural nightlight  
So full but often right  
A pair of eyes a closin' one  
A chosen child of golden sun  
A marble dog that chases cars  
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars  
  
A cosmic fish they love to kiss  
They're giving birth to constellation  
No riffs and oh no reservation  
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication  
May I suggest you get the best  
For nothing less than you and I  
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose the lighting  
Oh bella bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Do do do do do  
  
You are an illuminated anchor  
Of leads to infinite number  
Crashing waves and breaking thunder  
Tiding the evenflows of hunger  
You're dancing naked there for me  
You expose all memory  
You make the most of boundary  
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love  
You are the queen and king combining everything  
Into twining like a ring around the finger of a girl  
I'm just a singer, you're the world  
All I can bring ya  
Is the language of a lover  
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other  
  
May I suggest you get the best  
Of your wish may I insist  
That no contest for little you or smaller I  
A larger chance happened, all them they lie  
On the rise, on the brink of our lives  
Bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other, oh oh oh

Otherwise you're only living for it  
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it  
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the

To hand in his heart and take his last vacation  
Attempting to spoil imagination  
If anyone ever wonders where he went  
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over

Used to talk together, go to the park together

This common pleasure with most of human kinds  
It was a kind of treasure One that I was surely glad to find  
But I got one right here and I'm okay  
I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay  
I'm alright. Everything else is alright sometimes.  
  
Just remember those bones they get broken  
And love is not a token of affection  
It's not even a real thing, it's a word  
So don't you try to but it out with a ring  
Cause it's a verb, to love someone  
Open up and let them in  
Just don't be afraid to set them free again  
  
This ain't no heaven, ain't no hell , ain't no in between  
Cause there's just too many faces and places in this world  
That I ain't ever seen  
I'm gonna keep on keeping on  
I'm gonna reap on being strong  
I got my head on, though misconnected  
It's alright cause I do it protected  
I got a day job. I drive a cheap ride  
Sounds like I'm gonna fine

There's only so many brain cells that you can burn  
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned  
And leave you yearning for more, so much more  
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more  
Your stomach's gonna be churning  
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more.  
You're wanting some more, more, more  
Do you want some?

Opposite then a foot in a door,  
There's no one else I would rather go out with, thats hell when I see them
standing there  
Me and my mouth we don't mean to be rushing  
We talk about deep freely cause we crushing  
I want to shake both sides of the brush ya  
Theatrically I say we rock it  
  
And when the coyotes, they sing in the park  
It's when the city lights start fallin' for the sea  
While them roads are windin' down  
And the flying men'll hit the ground  
Every motion is close to the touch  
And the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'  
  
Coming back for more,

While we rock, we won't put a stop  
Not today not tomorrow.

You know why, cause we want you

I wish the world was a live like you.  
I wish the world would help me through  
Another repetuity to approach you  
Another telepathic rendezvous  
I wish you would walk when your jogging  
You got a duty to sell in Mexico  
I got to try to keep you acting shady  
I don't like liking you when you walk because  
I gotta figure out the snooze alarm  
I want'a lay in a place till dawn  
I want'a play in the park come on  
Now let me see ya alarm in the lesh hello

Then the city lights has crumbles to the sea  
And the girls turned it into lost and found  
The flying metal hit the ground  
Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes singing  
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving

When I stole my first rhyme from the M.I.C.  
At a west end avenue at 63  
The beginning of a leap year, February, '96  
With a guitar picked up in the mix  
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks

That I bet my whole checking account  
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end  
  
Well you can only count on the road again  
We'll soon be on the radio dial  
And I been payin' close attention to the Willie Nelson style  
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while  
I'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive  
Up the coast mc brag the most  
I'm pickin up my pace and makin' time like space ghost  
  
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most  
Put my cruise control on coast  
'cause I'm tourin' around the nation on extended vacation see  
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation  
I say, ""I like your style, crazy pound pup!  
You need a ride?  
Well come on, girl, hop in the truck!""

With my guitar here  
I'm ready to play  
And I'm s a sucker for a filly  
Got a natural ability to give the freestyle  
Look at my flexibility  
Dangerous at the mike  
My ghetto hat's cocked right  
The ladies say, ""yo, that kid is crazy""  
The backstage betties taking more than they can get  
They say, ""what's up with m-are-a-z?""

Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow

I had I dream that mystery was me. Now who else could I be?  
  
I dreamed I went to England and met the spice girls there for tea  
They lost one more they're down from four to my favorite number three  
But they're still quite spicy as the orange flavor  
And oh so nice to do me the favor and lick my icing under the table now  
But I gotta leave town mr. Nally, just as scary spice was about to go down on
me  
And don't ask how mr. Nally and give up the towel mr. Nally and run.  
  
I dreamed I went to Singapore got bored and robbed a liquor store  
What for? Nobody knows I only took a couple of Marlboros  
Oh but that was all they needed and the criminal was soon defeated  
And now in jail I'm waiting for my punishment of caining  
So I gotta think fast mr nally watch your ass, wake up and laugh and run  
  
Better Mr run, mr rand, mr mac, mr nally  
Mr run, mr man, you got the knack for the rally And run.  
  
I had a chance to visit the north pole but it was way too cold to smoke  
Oh my nose was freezing I should could use some coughing and wheezing  
So I tried it anyway and the place went up in flames  
How was I suppose to know you could catch fire to the snow  
Oh lord way to go mr nally, way to go, now you're melting the poles mr nally
so run.  
  
I jumped ship in NYC and headed south to Washington DC  
Didn't think I'd go there but played some shows there fancy lucky me  
But it is really slow there with our new president on TV  
Too many politicians and liberal Christians they're all set out for me  
Singing cast your vote mr nally, castrate your vote, no you don't, just run  
  
I thumbed a ride across the prairie, I got hitched in Vegas, yep, I got
married  
To a lady who loved me she thought it's be funny to gamble all my money  
And I got stranded without my clothes, a little bit of fear and loathing heart
attack  
I got chased by the rat pack once in a flashback. Singing viva Las Vegas.  
  
I settled down in San Diego and smoked a joint with java joe  
And with a grin he took me in spilling coffee on his chin  
And I played my show there and I met my bros there  
And with my throw pillow they kindly let me make my bed there  
There's one more thing before I go there's never been any place like this home  
  
For once in a lifetime maybe I'd be foolish not to stay

But the blue shy, oh blue soul  
And love with the tole it's taken  
A true crime is the perfect role  
I love every more that I take in  
So much that I'd do it again, I'd do it again

Every wonder so, full of wonder, so beautiful  
There's magic up above  
Every cliche I learn to love  
But as long as these birds have wings  
Then I'll have songs, and I'll have words to sing  
Sing of fallin over, I'm fallin over the whole damn thing

Let's throw out the hotel comforter and hang the 'do not disturb'  
Sign me up for the storm  
I'll wear my suit for the shower  
'Cause I'll have you to keep me warm in the coldest hour  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
Well every kiss, every hug is so light on that touch, delicate like a
snowflake  
Well I can taste, I can taste, I can taste, I can taste you all over my face  
And everyone might find it foolish to not be counting on the sun  
But your mouth is my umbrella now  
Because I'm holding your tongue  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
There's a good chance in hell  
Like cats and dogs we'll be flying  
And I'm no weatherman  
But you are lightning, striking  
  
Here comes the sun, and the rain  
All at once down the sink  
  
In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud  
And await for the warning of another come down  
Because the water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks  
My well holds plenty for penny wishin' in your deep end  
And when the lights go out, no doubt, with you I'll be  
  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
And if them rains should fall for sure with you I'll be  
Ah because crazy is the forecast all week long  
Crazy is the forecast

And fall into the darkness  
They exploded down, I knew what I had to do  
I ran up to the top of the hill  
And I took a hold for you  
You were the sweetest star that fell  
And yes, I held onto it close to the numbness in my heart  
And then I kissed a star, yes I did  
I wrapped it up inside of a golden bow  
And then I ran away just to find you  
'Cause this was your gift, your gift, oh shit  
A star that I kissed  
Oh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes  
Was in need, I said it was in need  
Of a, of a brand new shining light  
I said I wished to the dark sky above  
That all I had was to be captured  
And willingly turned over to you  
I know you better now and at this I smile  
I simply gave to you the symbol of what you are to me  
You are the star that shines  
And explodes with light and I love and embrace  
Love and embrace all that I can  
You better take this blindness and stay away from me  
And let me bask inside of your golden seam

I never knew it could come to me and not by the ways of the heart  
And call on me to be one of those strangely dressed wise men  
Who follow the stars to their love  
You are such a perfect star to wish upon

Of what this lonely, lonely night  
Will lead me tonight

There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive

By the pool last night, apparently  
The chemicals weren't mixed properly  
You hit your head and then forgot your name  
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  
And now your altitude and memory's a shame  
  
[Chorus]  
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up  
With a little bit more of innocence  
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young  
It's OK to be easily ignored  
I like to believe it was all about love for a child  
  
And when the house was left in shambles  
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age

It is fact and it is standing here  
Right in front of you

Oh what a sweet discovery  
There is hope and there is joy  
And there is exceptance  
So now let all the light collect that collects on your plants  
Keep your wamr make you smile  
And I iwll be there with this pen in my hand  
To record all the while you'll be laughing so loud  
That the house would shake with sound  
And everything will be as new as the day  
It was found  
  
Love is real  
It is not just in long distance commercials  
Or something that you thought you  
Felt back in highschool  
So I will turn black and white  
Become that horoscope your readin'  
It predicts that something good is on it's way  
Oh and I'll send you all the world green and blue  
In a box through the mail  
You can open it up hold it right in your hand  
And be glad that it's there  
And be glad that you're there  
Now you can feel all the knotts in ur stomach  
They start to untie  
And suddenly it's not so hard to say your alright  
  
Oh.. Love is real  
It is not just in poetry and stories  
It is truth and it will follow you  
Everywhere you go from now on  
So if you just cast off your doubts  
Then your lips would answer for you  
Oh my darling when you smile it is like a song  
  
And I can heart it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now... Can hear it now  
And I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now...

Move so pretty you're all I see  
As the world keeps spinning round

Let me stop to lock the top  
For fear of it falling hard

Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke  
How did it drown our love

When it rains it's sure to pour

As time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro
mile wide  
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun  
To swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines  
Then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the
dreams  
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to  
And they knew it was time, time to take a chance here  
Time to compromise our little lives for just a little while  
And they knew it was time for all the wrong reasons  
As time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy  
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again  
  
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  
Would he take it all back what they've done  
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands  
That was my old man and he said  
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired  
  
I found myself in the riches your eyes, your lips, your hair  
Well you were everywhere  
But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here  
but you were nowhere. You were nowhere at home.

Very cool, very cool. I grew up in Virginia.  
This is the closest Ive ever played to home, so  
This is very very groovy. Lets see what happens.  
  
Strange because I believe it is my future  
Staring back at me  
With eyes so light  
I never dreamed it could be  
Anything else than what they could see  
Oh, they are colors  
That collide and scope  
My heart belongs into  
Magnificent ever-changing patterns do  
Im wide awake at the wheel  
Its oh so crazy because I can see  
It could be my presence  
So pleasantly deprived  
Ive never seen the explained prophecies  
Or anything else it should be  
Oh they are troubled  
And disguised behind wise eyes and wise crackin smiles  
Hypnotized behind a panel  
On a thirty hour drive  
Im not at all what I seem  
But my intentions are practical inventions  
Forgot to mention Im insane by definition  
Were taking pictures on the paper  
No escape, the morning after I outride the wave

We keep it simple  
Keep it clean  
Keep repeating the words as often as you need  
Oh, think, think  
Blinks like a turning signal me to  
Turn, turn away oh  
From anything good, people say  
Oh now, I will be selective, calm, cool and collective  
And listening to the voice and it's perspective  
Hoping that the choices, appropriately respected  
Are protecting me, are protecting me  
Hey, hey, protecting me, protecting me  
And I would like a little sugar in my coffee  
I would like a little dream  
And I'd prefer another smoke before the morning  
Or anything else in between

Said, all in all, it's unlikely  
All in all, it's unlikely well succeed  
All in all, I said, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Ive developed a lovely distaste for your wide open spaces  
I sense a delay  
Oh, brushing my mind and scrubbing behind all the places I feel there's decay  
Of information  
Away, I say run, boy

Oh, oh we keep it  
So wicked and it's wild  
Your past, your former style

While surrounded, not where all the flowers grow  
On an empty orchard street  
She is dreaming of her holiday  
From a working glass menagerie  
Oh her hands are cold  
Unimaginable that shes warming up to me  
  
I'm a passerby in a promise land  
And I face no direction  
Somewhere between the towns of lost and found  
In the state of confusion  
Sure our dreaming is pure wonderment  
But our feelings are no accident  
If my heart is cold it won't forever be,  
Cause your warming up to me  
  
And fate is not a mission  
Its an unconditional high  
When I saw you in the garden  
You reminded me  
I can see, the stars are on your shoulders now  
And what the wind and your skin have in common  
Am I taller? Well if feels as though I'm above the ground  
You're inviting me to go down  
  
Are you warming up?  
Are you burning up?  
Warming up to love?  
Are you warming up tonight?

Jason Mraz,What It Takes,/j/jason+mraz/what+it+takes_20574012.html,"It takes a crane to build a crane  
It takes two floors to make a story  
It takes an egg to make a hen  
It takes a hen to make an egg  
There is no end to what I'm saying  
  
It takes a thought to make a word  
And it takes a word to make an action  
It takes some work to make it work  
It takes some good to make it hurt  
It takes some bad for satisfaction

It takes a night to make it dawn  
And it takes a day to you yawn brother  
It takes a mood to make you young  
It takes some cold to know the sun  
It takes the one to have the other  
  
It takes no time to fall in love  
But it takes you years to know what love is  
It takes some tears to make you trust  
It takes some years to make it rust  
It takes some dust to make it polished

It takes a loss before you found it  
It takes a road to go nowhere

Does the light mean that it's light like in air?  
Will I dream? Will I get to meet Jesus?  
Or like the lover will I come right back?  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Need not waste time asking why did my life,  
No holding back  
  
Like a wind we've been solved,  
We sing to the memories of long days  
Gone so do I sing along, I'll remember you  
  
Years go fast, I'm already looking back,  
Me, I know I won't last cause when I cry I don't just cry  
I fold in half  
  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
  
There's a fear about leaving here  
That the devil you will find but if love,  
If love is all there ever was,  
There'll be peace on the other side  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Me, I'll go out dancing cause when I die  
I know I'm gonna fly into an angels hands

We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman,  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
We'll say: No man,  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town.

As we dream by the fire babe

To find that thing that makes it right

Some other kind of love  
  
I will, love you all my life  
Always be by your side  
And I will give you all I have

Again, again, again

When I look into your heart  
You got everything I want  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more

Fits me like a glove

With your fine Park Avenue clothes  
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand  
And the spoon up your nose  
And when you wake up in the morning  
With your head on fire  
And your eyes to bloody to see  
Go on and cry in your coffee  
But don't come bitchin' to me  
  
Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You had to have the white hot spotlight  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
They were all impressed with your Halston dress  
And the people that you knew at Elaine's  
And the story of your latest sucess  
Kept 'em so entertained  
Aw but now you just don't remember  
All the things you said  
And you're not sure you want to know  
I'll give you one hint, honey  
You sure did put on a show  
  
Yes, yes you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to prove it to the crowd  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You're so much fun to be around  
You had to have front page, bold type  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in  
If you know when to leave it alone  
But you went over the line  
You couldn't see it was time to go home  
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you

I ain't a gangsta, that's just my image  
I ain't a thug either nigga, I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you, listen to me  
I'm trying to tell you what's real, I don't live my life dangerously  
Live how I live, live by my rules  
You wouldn't survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug, and talk like a gangsta  
But that don't mean I'm gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich, I'm stay with my crew  
I'ma stay with my peeps, I'ma stay in the streets  
I'ma keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now I'm not saying this to build my fan base  
And I don't give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And I'ma stay true to myself, I'm a man  
I'm a real nigga, hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock, I'm just Cris from the block  
Ya I'm that same troublemaking kid from the block (whut)

I went from boy to man, ain't nobody gonn' stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man, from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man, from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man, from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And there's Haze selling crack overseas,  
P. Diddy himself can't get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats

Just trust in it, I'm lovin it

Cus I've become brave  
As the light of day straight into a cave  
To show me the way, that I might be saved  
Now I'm turning the page  
Thanks to the power of love I can love  
Because I am brave  
  
  
I am brave, I am brave  
  
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him  
It's a feelin I was straddeling  
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes  
Really wish he would let me in  
Cus the same way I'm scared of him  
I'm scared of being hurt again  
  
It's time to let go, let go of your heart  
It's time for a brand new start

But put together, the cracks were closing

Hurry up, hurry up  
There's no more waiting  
We're still worth saving

Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back

Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back

You and I can have it all tonight  
So let's bring it back to life  
Now we have another chance to fly  
Another chance to make it right

Grammy nominations and platinum plus ain't nothing baby  
All I want in life, all night long  
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  
  
You priceless, you like diamonds and icey wrists  
We got chedda, I'm twice as rich  
Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless  
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists  
Treat you like a bitch, never that  
We got beef where my niggaz at  
Streets is where I'm living at  
  
Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack  
Where we at, uptown where its really at  
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht  
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop  
Let my hands slip a knot  
  
Joe you the don  
  
Jenny you the bomb  
Any man disrespect, good as gone  
  
When I opened up my eyes today  
Felt the sun shining on my face  
It became so clear to me  
That everything is going my way  
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see  
Got rid of my fears that were holding me  
My endless possibilities  
Has the whole world opened up for me  
That's why I'm feeling  
  
I'm feeling so good

Been taking care of myself like I should

Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
Now the day is turning into night  
And everything is still going right  
There's no way you can stop me this time  
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no  
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine  
Anything I want will be mine  
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time  
Call a few friends of mine

Puertorican diva, from la isla bonita  
Let me freak ya on the dance floor  
Lead your man off,  
He's just trying to get your pants off  
  
That's the last straw  
Pun I ain't got a glass jaw  
Better run when you see me coming through the back door  
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother  
There's to things I don't share  
That's my money and my mother  
  
I love honeys since the paradise for real  
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real  
  
Shut up your grill

It's your world girl, set it off right

After all of the stealing and the cheating you'd probably think that  
I hold resentment for you

Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for makin' me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin round playin, the victim now  
But don't even begin feelin' I'm the one to blame

After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me

Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through libing in denial  
But in the end you'll see

Straight from the hood  
You've always been there for me  
  
And you had my back when they  
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything  
It was you that kept me holding on  
No matter what was going on  
So whatever you need I got you yaa  
  
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back  
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs  
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments  
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet  
When Pun died you was the first to call me  
I never told you  
But you was there for me  
Whatever you need, I be there for you  
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story  
  
Now my loyalty will always be  
With you if you just promise me  
That you'll stay real just like you are

Something in the dark shot glasses, you know  
Something that you can lean to  
Something that you can ride to  
Something that you can step to  
You know  
  
Sometimes real love can be  
Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'  
What's right in front of you  
Can't be the one for you  
  
Then one day you realize that  
There are feelings that you can't hold back  
And you're so caught up  
Now that's all you think of  
Crazy how  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you  
You got me  
  
I got you  
  
Things are often said to  
Doubt what I feel for you  
But words that people say  
Won't take my love away  
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright  
But why they say some things that ain't right  
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
I got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
  
So that's all that people can do  
Never mind all the love, all that you  
gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay focused on us  
Together we'll get through whatever if we  
Don't let speculations make situations up  
We'll be alright  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, babe)

And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside)  
'Cause you gotta know

And it feels so good to have your back now

If there's a party I'm in  
I started getting sick of it  
But when I looked back I didn't know what it meant  
I guess I wasn't interested  
In finding something real  
Though I was looking for it  
You should've been looking for me  
But you opened up my eyes  
And now I can see  
And everytime the subject would come up  
When they say ""I love you""  
Then I only dumb up  
A lot of guys  
A girl or shut up  
But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless  
A lot of words with feeling can not sum up  
But first I had to figure out who I was  
To try and understand that there ain't no shortcuts  
Now the only thing that's missing is your love  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real

Jennifer Lopez,I Wish I Wasn't,/j/jennifer+lopez/i+wish+i+wasnt_20620547.html,"First Verse  
I'm home alone again  
And you're out, hanging with your friends  
So you say, but I know it's not quite that way  
It's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day  
When I called you didn't answer  
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me, tight in your arms  
And I wish, I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So you couldn't hurt me  
It just ain't fair the way you treat me  
No you don't deserve me  
Wasted my time thinking about you and you ain't never gone change  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So I wouldn't feel this way  
  
Verse 2  
When you touch me my heart melts  
And everything you did wrong I forgive  
So you play me and take advantage  
Of the love that I feel for you  
Why you wanna hurt me so bad  
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad  
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and its hard for me to even look at you  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms ooh baby  
I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Bridge  
Said you care about me, but from what I see  
I ain't feeling that, so I disagree  
Gave you all my love and understanding and you treated me like your enemy  
So leave me alone, don't want nothing from you  
Just go back where you came from this house is no longer your home  
You you are not welcome no more  
  
Chorus (repeat 2x)  
  
Outro  
I hear you knocking at my door again  
I'm wondering should I let you in  
I open up the door and see the flowers for me  
So beautiful in your hands  
You start begging me to take you back,  
I've always been a sucker for romance  
And before you know it I can see, you're all over me  
Oh no here I go again  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you so you couldn't hurt me

I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears,  
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears,  
The reason there?s two carrots in each of your ears,  
I spurge with the paper ma, I don't care,  
How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, and coops  
Make celebrities, 50 fall off never,  
What?s, mine is yours and what?s yours is mine,  
So when I shine, you shine.  
C?mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life,  
Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice,  
Don't let your friends get ya confused, said 50 bad news,  
I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose.  
  
It?s funny cause, for a while,  
I walked around with a smile but,  
Deep inside, I could hear, voices telling me this ain't right.  
Don?t you know, it?s not for you,  
I always knew what I had to do.  
But it?s hard, to get away,  
Because I love you I just tried to stay.  
  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And I know inside I?ma be alright.  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

Friends of mine, say to me,  
They say you got control over me.  
You?re not alone, I played my part,  
I saw the way you were from the start.  
Could I expect, so much from you,  
You had a girl when I first met you.  
Did the best that you could do  
Now I realize I can't change you

And that voice inside says I?m gonna be alright.  
  
Said I wouldn't walk away,  
Some days I want to stay,  
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay.  
Never thought it would be true,  
Me livin' without you,  
But now it's time for me to make that move.  
  
Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it,  
When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it.  
You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you,  
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you.  
All the talkin on the phone, all the time we share,  
How could you fix your mouth to say, ?I don't care?  
I had plans for us, to buy ice together,  
Engagement rings, and things and share life together,  
Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you?re like whatever.  
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start,  
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart.  
Just want you to know you?ll always have a place in my heart.

Jennifer Lopez,It's Hard To Be A Girl,/j/jennifer+lopez/its+hard+to+be+a+girl_20620542.html,"Once upon a magazine  
There I saw a beauty queen  
And she challenged me to be something I could not be  
She had the looks, the kind that kill.  
With one look I felt so incomplete and obsolete  
I can't compete, you can't compete...  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror I'm tryin' to see mine,  
Not the traces of the faces that I've seen a million times...  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change...  
  
CHORUS  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
So, you want a perfect girl  
In a mini skirt and pearls  
With a lovely disposition and changeable opinions  
That may be nice, but here's the facts...  
I won't sacrifice true love that lasts, for house and cash  
I can't do that, I won't do that  
  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror and I can't believe my eyes  
Cause I'm seeing what's inside me for the very first time  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change a thing  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl

You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
Gotta get your influence from something real  
So c'mon live your life girl...  
God will give you the hope  
If you just imagine  
All that He can do if you want Him to  
  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...

You'll be open off my love  
If only for one night  
  
I know I can make you mine  
Touch you in that place you like  
You'll be open off my love  
Take a moment to stop and think about  
The last time you felt like this  
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see  
'Cause I know you're feeling me  
I can see it in your eyes  
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you

Don't waste another moment  
Don't hold back  
I'm gonna give you what you need

Do you like the things that life's been showing you

2 - Do you get  
What you're hoping for  
When you look behind you  
There's no open door  
What are you hoping for?  
Do you know?  
  
Once we were standing still in time  
Chasing the fantasies  
That filled our minds  
You knew how I loved you  
But my spirit was free  
Laughing at the questions  
That you once asked of me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Now looking back at all we've planned  
We let so many dreams  
Just slip through our hands  
Why must we wait so long  
Before we'll see  
How sad the answers  
To those questions can be  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2  
Repeat 1 till fade

Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love

Ooh, and the only thing that you could've done, you choose to walk away  
  
I'm thankful, love  
I don't hate you  
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through

Know my love can reach you  
Not a wall too high  
Or a mountainside  
Could keep me from seeing you  
  
[Verse:]  
Whenever you're too tired  
I could give you power  
Go the extra mile  
In your darkest hour  
Any day or night  
Call my name and I  
I'll come running to be with you

And I'll be fierce as a tiger  
If anyone tries to fight ya  
But I'll be soft as a lamb  
When you're in my hands  
I can bend  
However I need to

That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love

I will understand  
When you need space  
I will hold your hand  
When you're in pain  
I'll be patient and pause  
Most relationships  
Require a give and take  
  
[Verse:]  
And I will never let my ego  
Nor the words of other people  
Get in the way  
Or stop from saying  
How much I care and I need you

My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love

That's what I call love... Baby  
It's more than just a word  
Let me show you my love... Baby

When everything was still  
And you were by my side so soft and warm

In the lemon-scented rain

Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go  
Back to my motel room. But the rest is just a tragic tale

Done brought me twenty long years in jail

She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune

But when it comes to slaughter  
You will do your work for water  
An' you'll lick the boots of 'I'm that's got it  
Now in Inja's sunny clime  
Where I used to spend my time  
Servin' her Majesty the Queen  
Of all the black faced crew  
The finest man I knew  
Was regimental bhisti, Gunga Din  
  
The uniform he wore  
Was nothin' much before  
An' rather less than half of that behind  
But a piece of twisty rag  
An' a goatskin water bag  
Was all the field equipment he could find  
  
When a sweatin' troop train lay  
In a sidin' through the day  
Where the heat would make you bloomin' eyebrows crawl  
We shouted, ""Harry By""  
Till our throats were bricky-dry  
Then wopped him 'cause he couldn't serve us all  
He would dot an' carry one  
Till the longest day was done  
An' never seemed to know the use of fear  
If we charged or broke or cut  
You could bet your bloomin' nut  
He'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear  
With his mussick on his back  
He would skip to our attack  
An' watch us till the bugles made""Retire""  
An' for all his dirty hide  
He was white, clear white inside  
When he went to tend the wounded under fire  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
With the bullets kickin' dust spots on the green  
And when the cartridges ran out  
You could hear the front files shout  
Send ammunition mules, and Gunga Din!  
I shan't forget the night  
When I fell behind the fight  
With a bullet where my belt plate should a' been  
I was chokin' mad with thirst  
An' the man that spied me first  
Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din  
He lifted up my head  
An' he plugged me where I bled  
An' he gave me half a pint of water green  
It was crawlin' and it stunk  
But of all the drinks I've drunk  
I'm most grateful to the one from Gunga Din  
  
He carried me away  
To where a dooli lay  
An' a bullet came and drilled the beggar clean  
He carried me inside  
An' just before he died  
I hope you like your drink said Gunga Din  
So I'll meet him later on  
In the place where he as gone  
Where it's always double drill and no canteen  
He'll be squattin' on the coals  
Givin' drink to poor damn souls  
I'll catch a swig in hell from Gunga Din  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din  
Tho' I've belted you an' flayed you  
By the livin' God that made you  
Your a better man than I am, Gunga Din

But I fell in love last Friday evenin'  
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen  
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat  
When she caught my eye and I put it back  
And I ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers

The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen  
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round)  
The meanest hunk o' woman  
That anybody ever seen  
Down in the arena  
  
She is a five foot six and two fifteen  
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean  
She knew how to knuckle  
And she knew how to scuffle and fight  
And the roller derby program said  
That she were built like a 'fridgerator with a head  
The fans called her ""Tuffy""  
But all her buddies called her ""Spike""

Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
  
Well I could not help it but to fall in love  
With this heavy-duty woman I been speakin' of  
Things looked kind of bad  
Until the day she skated into my life  
  
Well she might be nasty she might be fat  
But I never met a person who would tell her that  
She's my big blonde bomber  
My heavy handed Hackensack mama

To take me to her loving arms

Walking along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to

And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

The big drive wheels a-pounding along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on

And the guard that walks that wall  
Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights  
But if I can clear the top  
You can bet I'll never stop

Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they don't  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?  
  
Now those guards are on my tail  
I can hear those sirens wail  
But I know that I'll get away and that I'll be alright  
Cause I'd rather live on the run  
Stand free in the morning sun  
Then to spend another lonely prison night

And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
And you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Hope you never in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine

Someone else will come along and pick 'em up

If I don't see you in the morning  
Guess the sun might come up anyway  
And without you here to love and stand beside me  
Guess I just might make it through the day  
If you should call from time to time  
Don't be surprised  
If the voice that answers ain't mine

If you can't get what you want, want what you got  
And I won't be drugged with words like joy and sorrow  
I won't feel one way or the other

It's too far to run and too late to hide  
  
Now you turn your back on  
All the things that you used to preach  
Now it's, ""Let him live in freedom, if he lives like me""

When your flowers turned to guns

The wind blows and the  
Fire grows towards the  
Far shores and the water  
Foams to make steamed  
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...

Before God tells us to our  
Face we are... Past the human race.  
Let's pray that we all agree  
We got to straighten out the family tree.

From heaven where 1, 000, 000  
Worlds are one.

Here comes black gold...  
Gather round young and old...  
He's going to be felt by the  
Timid and the bold...  
Within a wink of an eye,  
  
With the wink of an eye  
Egos swell, bust and die...  
Kingdoms fall and cry...  
With the wink of an eye...  
With the wink of an eye

Jimi Hendrix,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window,/j/jimi+hendrix/can+you+please+crawl+out+your+window_20174315.html,"(Bob Dylan)  
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back  
I'm sure that he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Jimi Hendrix,Crystal Ball,/j/jimi+hendrix/crystal+ball_20071697.html,"As I looked into my crystal ball...  
There was formed a tragedy.  
Oh but there's nothing to worry about...  
It was just a flash from my memory.  
Well it seems that the holiday wheel...,  
You know, the one that was between earth  
And the moon...well any way, there was  
2,000,000 killed...bodies floating in the  
Afternoon...  
  
Explosions, 1,000 or more, announcing  
Tidal waves and hurricanes...  
And down on earth we lost 3 continents.  
Their fiery soul snuffed out by  
Nature's ice and rains...  
  
And pieces of my life...floating,  
Still soaring through space...  
But my sons and their wives  
Landed on mars to start another race...  
  
As I gazed upon my crystal ball,  
There formed a cloud of jealousy.  
But there's nothing to feel sad about...  
By this time, it's due for only history.  
Well, it seems that the chambers of the  
Gods were being emptied for good.  
Why would such heavenly beings want  
To desert earth ?  
But as I watched I understood.  
  
As the clouds turned to a jealous  
Green, which was concieved in the heart  
Of man...the people didn't respect  
The help of the gods. instead they turned against  
Immortal man. as they tried to defy, they  
Died, into the wicked pits of hell.  
  
Diana wept a tear after we made love  
And said: ""my earthly darling, I must bid  
You farewell...the fate of your mud brothers ...  
As pieces of my life...floating,  
Still soaring in space...  
She could have been my wife  
But her time, I didn't dare wish  
To waste.  
  
As I stared into my crystal ball,  
There was formed a tearing of hearts.  
Ego armies marched antly onto view  
Only to be blown apart.  
  
As the sun whispered it's secret  
Through space...to men thinking the false pride  
Opposite...telling them that it was  
Such a disgrace to think that men were  
The ruler of it. well you know  
How the story goes...the sun they thought  
Was their circling slave...  
Round and round and round the  
Table she goes. some carried  
The thought right to their grave...  
And I smell the scorch of the  
Burnt out minds...who searched  
For the hurting truth of space. and the  
Dizziness they felt inside...  
Reflected off the spinning  
Slave pebble earth...  
  
As fragments of my life...  
Some floating, some soaring in space  
Collections of my soul  
Will turn complete only as time will age.  
  
As my tears drop on my crystal ball,  
Magnifies the reflections of christ.  
As I blink, his angels take him away.  
What he said, man tries to self  
?help from god. as reward, he  
Wipes our blood from his eyes...  
And the cross that he would  
Use for his throne represents  
Not life but death. is this the way  
All heroes go ? ...carrying the first necklace  
Of death...  
His preaching the belief  
Of eternal happiness to rest.  
Or were his angels just ufos  
Vapor trails lead from  
Another light year land...  
Or was it really tomorrow's  
Awakening day dream...blemished  
By the smudgy finger prints of man...  
  
And slivers of my life...floating,  
Still soaring in space...  
And spirits of bee hives  
Even they find a resting place.  
  
As I wander through my crystal ball,  
I suddenly ride upon the waves of sound.  
I see platforms of launching  
Pads even before the first blade of  
Grass turned brown.  
  
And I taste their tunnels through  
The sky...as the axis turns in it's womb.  
Frozen flowers and animals try to  
Hold positions they had before  
Their morning bloomed...  
And I follow the last rocket up  
To the libraries of the moon's meadows.

And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.  
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,  
Playing to the music that the drivers made.  
People passing by they'd stop and say  
Oh my that little country boy could play

And the wind whispers Mary

Of the broken pieces of yesterdays life  
Somewhere a queen is weeping  
Somewhere a king has no wife  
And the wind it cries Mary  
  
THE TRAFFIC lights they a turn blue tomorrow  
And shine the emptiness down on my bed  
The tiny island sags down the street  
Cause the life that lives is dead  
And the wind screams Mary.  
  
Will the wind every remember  
The names it has blown in the past  
And with this crush it's old age and it's wisdom  
It whisper no this will be the last  
And the wind cries Mary.

There are people so dear...  
They're like children...  
Naked in a cold world...  
Beautiful children  
In an old world...  
  
May I take you away  
From the evils of today  
To the dreams of tomorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no sorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no tomorrow.  
  
Hear the sound of the magic drums...  
Hearts are beating for the sun...  
Sending evil on the run...  
Now watch the wind...  
  
Look over yonder...  
Here comes some news...  
Coming down like lightning...  
Straight for me and you.  
People of destruction  
Your time is out of date...  
People who's living crooked,  
Better start getting straight.  
  
I've been through some changes,  
A whole lot of re-arranges...  
Been through some ups and downs,  
And whole lot of turn arounds.  
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...  
1, 000 times ago and maybe 1, 000  
Times more.  
  
She said she comes from ice land...  
I told her I was from the west.  
She took me to the snow capped mountains...  
And then she put me through the test...  
We walked across the glacier,  
The horses stayed behind...  
And as we laid between the  
Frozen vallies we kissed  
For the very first time.  
And now we're stuck together.  
  
It was too long ago.  
But it seems like... Years ago...  
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.  
Lately things seem a little colder...  
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder.  
  
Forget of my name  
Remember it only as a hand shake,  
Introduction to my belief which is god.  
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,  
Music, sound  
Hynotic if you choose  
But truth and life  
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises  
Which I intend to erase.  
Which I will erase without hint of reward  
As I am only a messenger  
And you a sheep in process of evolution  
Almost at death with yourself  
And on the staircase of birth.  
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family...

Got more to say  
  
Well I'm riding through L.A. ha  
On a bicycle built for fools  
And I seen one of my old buddies  
And he say 'you don't look the way you usually do'  
I say ' well some people look like a coin-box'  
He say 'look like you ain't got no coins to spare'  
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this  
I just picked up my pride form underneath the pay phone  
And combed this breath right out of my hair  
And sometimes it's not so easy  
Especially when your only friend  
Talks sees looks and feels like you  
And you do just the same as him  
  
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail  
And I'm on my way straight home to you  
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror  
To make sure my friend's here with me too  
And you know good well I don't drink coffee  
So you fill my cup full of sand  
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom  
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge  
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on  
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge  
And I thought you were my friend too  
Man, my shadow comes in line before you  
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy  
Specially when your only friend  
Talks, looks, sees, and feels like you  
And you do the same just like him  
  
Lord it's so lonely here hmm yeah  
Yeah!  
Pass me that bottle over there  
Yeah yeah o.k.

The truth was not a mystery--  
  
Love called to all...music is magic.  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--  
  
We came together...danced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Space--music is magic...  
Magic is life...  
Love as never loved before...

That the news is all bad  
Well, I think it's time for a song about that  
  
Up on the East side of Manhattan,  
They're still dancing with the stars.  
While over in sub prime city,  
It's getting ugly in the local bars  
Watching the news only gives me the blues  
There's too much going wrong.  
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key  
And write a high speed drinking song.  
  
Millionaires losing everything.  
Hey, welcome to the other side of life!  
There goes the yacht, there goes the Rolls,  
But you, you get to keep your wife!  
And don't forget the automakers  
Swimming up stream like a trout.  
They let the shit hit the fan  
And then they made a plan  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
There's the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
Now, Madoff made off with all the money.  
And his clients are down to skunk weed.  
Repeat after me, it's so easy to see  
We're only talking simple greed.  
And those Somalian pirates are counting all the gold.  
While Bush and Cheney ain't around  
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers  
From Key West to London town.  
  
With the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
So pour me some Tennessee whiskey,  
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum.  
That loud mouth soup  
Can get ya kinda looped  
Tequila, of course I'll have some!  
  
Well the family devalues  
And little children plan their net worth  
And the truth wherever it's hiding,  
Can be found on Google Earth.  
Citibank's buying jets with our money.  
I wanna flog 'em with a buggy whip.  
Let's hope Obama and Joe won't let the volcano blow  
And patch the hole in our sinking ship.  
  
There's the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
Recession, opression, depression, good God  
CNN keeps bumming me out.  
I can't take another doomsday minute  
We got a lot to drink, a lot to think,  
A lot to drink about.  
  
God bless America!

Switch from sails to steam  
And in your belly you can hold the treasures  
Few have ever seen

Made enough money to buy Miami  
But I pissed it away so fast

Passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks

Jimmy Buffett,African Friend,/j/jimmy+buffett/african+friend_20072070.html,"Disembarking at Duvalier Airport  
Seeking transportation to town  
As the purple ink dried on his passport  
He could still feel the eyes look around  
  
""Messieur ou est le casino?""  
He spoke to the cabbie and smiled  
The driver replied ""Vieux ou noveaux?""  
As he motioned the dark man inside.  
  
Business in Aruba concluded  
He now had a little money to spend  
That's how I came to meet my African friend  
  
We were rollin' the bones several hours  
Conversing as most gamblers do  
We were calling on all of our powers  
Hoping to see the night through.  
  
But not approving at all of our winning  
The pit boss he tugged at his sleeve  
Through the whole thing my new friend was grinning  
When he motioned it's time we should leave.  
  
With our night at the tables behind us  
We were ready just to do it again  
That's when I came to know my African Friend  
  
But I woke up on the steps of a whorehouse  
Soldier told me I' better leave  
As I stumbled to find me a taxi  
I saw a note pinned to my sleeve.  
  
""It was a pleasure and a hell of an evening  
Truly was our night to win  
But the authorities insist on my leaving  
Take care, my American friend.""  
  
With my weekend at Haiti concluded  
I now had a little money to spend  
That's when I came to meet my African friend  
That's how I came to know another good friend.

Smiles as if to tell  
Her son remembers everyone  
Treats 'em all quite well  
He never asked for promises  
And now his fame is wide  
And everyone who knew him well shares a little pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't he a genius?  
The boy's become a star  
And he smiles upon the faces  
Who wish they could go far  
  
Not long ago they criticized  
The genius only wrote  
And now they listen spellbound  
With lumps caught in their throats  
  
His virtue was sheer poverty  
His vice was reading plays  
While other children starved and fought  
He learned just what to say  
Through tension and confession  
He beat the monster down  
Then surfaced in society no longer underground  
  
[Chorus]  
Now they remember  
Talk only of his good  
While jealousy flows in their veins  
And says I wish I could  
  
Ain't he a genius?

Jimmy Buffett,Beach House On The Moon,/j/jimmy+buffett/beach+house+on+the+moon_20071845.html,"Cameron's getting logical,  
A Vulcan in disguise,  
The mysteries of the night are  
Putting sparkle in his eyes.  
He's looking for sound reasoning,  
But the best that I can do,  
Is this transcendental story,  
That I'll pass along to you.  
  
Past the falls they call Victoria,  
Down the river named the Nile,  
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat,  
It's shaped just like a smile.  
  
And steered by a magician,  
With the knowledge that he needs,  
To keep him on his destined course,  
Past the crocodiles and reeds.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean,  
The Lone Eagle in the sky,  
He gave me my first sextant,  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
It's been quite a lengthy passage,  
From the dawn of time till now,  
He has weathered the infernal storms  
In his trusty petite dow.  
  
He has soared about colossal waves,  
Sailed the endless sea.  
Sometimes he resembles you,  
Sometimes he looks like me.  
  
I saw him through my telescope,  
On a cloudless night in June,  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
There are windows to the galaxies  
And hallways to the past.  
There are trapdoors to the future  
And a splintered ancient mast.  
There are relics from Apollo trips,  
When the earthmen came to play,  
And a hammock from a distant star,  
Out in the Milky Way.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky.  
He game me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
A stripped bass breaks the surface  
As the sunset fades away  
And our journey from the Sea of Storms  
Takes us home beside the bay.  
We go fishing in the ocean  
We go traveling back in time  
Like the song says 'teach your children'  
To go fishing with their minds.  
  
Cameron's contemplating  
I'm not sure just what he thinks  
""Is my dad some kind of lunatic  
With his stories and high hi-jinks"".  
Then he says when I get old and gray  
And feel like I'm marooned,  
He will take me in his rocket ship  
To that beach house on the moon.

You've heard heard about the sugar barons screwin' up the 'glades,  
It's a melting pot existence  
That is hard to contemplate  
And a never ending battle in the Sunshine State.  
  
But far, far away from the front page news,  
Far, far away from the headline blues,  
Down a secondary road that severely shows its age  
The forties comes to life on a make-shift stage.  
  
It's the Bob Robert's Society Band.  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand.  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud.  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.  
  
Well, the word goes out  
From Melbourne to the Keys.  
The faithful get the message  
Like it's written on the breeze.  
Young folks, old folks,  
'Bout to cut a rug  
Fox Trot, Bunny Hop,  
Do the Jitterbug,  
  
To the Bob Robert's Society Band.  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand.  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud.  
It's the magic of the music that still draws a crowd.  
  
I saw mini vans from Boca,  
Buses from Perrine.  
There were people speaking Hindu  
In the Bar-B-Que line.  
A couple on their honeymoon  
Looked a bit confused.  
But the boys in the band put 'em right in the mood.  
They played.....  
  
A lady dressed in purple started dancing all alone  
Then she sauntered oh so gently to the vacant microphone.  
She sounded like she's someone and never missed a beat.  
By the time the number ended they were dancin' in the street.  
  
They'd died and gone to heaven,  
That lively little crowd,  
Trombones and saxophones  
Sent 'em through the clouds.  
It could have gone all night  
But the party had to stop.  
When they blew the circuit breaker  
In the souvenir shop.  
  
It's the Bob Robert's Society Band  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They don't play grunge and they don't play loud

Big blue hole out in the ocean  
Where I dive straight down until  
I can not see  
Feel my way through a bevy of solutions  
There I realize the answer lies in me  
  
Gettin' off of this boomerang love  
Comin' up for air  
Do what's right do what's fair

No more boom boom

Floating down canal  
It doesn't use numbers or moving hands  
It always just says now  
Now you may be thinking that I was had  
But this watch is never wrong  
And If I have trouble the warranty said  
Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On  
  
And it rained, It was nothing really new  
And it blew, we've seen all that before  
And it poured, the Earth began to strain  
Pontchartrain leaking through the door, tides at war  
  
If a hurricane doesn't leave you dead  
It will make you strong

Now he's stuck in Porto Bello  
Since his money all ran out  
So he hangs out with the sailors  
Might and day they're raisin' hell  
And his original destination's just another  
Story that he loves to tell.  
  
With no plans for the future  
He still seems in control  
From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide  
He just had to learn to roll.  
  
Roll with the punches  
Play all of his hunches  
Made the best of whatever came his way  
What he lacked in ambition  
He made up with intuition  
Plowing straight ahead come what may.  
  
Steel band in the distance  
And their music floats across the bay  
While American women in muumuus  
Talk about all the things they did today  
And their husbands quack about fishing  
As they slug those rum drinks down  
Discussing who caught what  
and who sat on his butt  
But it's the only show in town.

No, I don't want to swim in a roped off sea.  
Too much for me, too much for me  
I've got to be where the wind and the water are free.  
  
Alone on a midnight passage  
I can count the falling stars  
While the Southern Cross and the satellites  
They remind me of where we are  
Spinning around in circles  
Living it day to day  
And still twenty four hours, maybe sixty good years  
It's still not that long a stay.  
  
We've gotta roll with the punches  
Learn to play all of our hunches  
Makin' the best of whatever comes your way  
Forget that blind ambition  
And learn to trust your intuition  
Plowin' straight ahead come what may.

Ambiance so fine, dancin' drinkin' wine  
Sing about the lifestyle on the bayou

Creola in my soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
Fall in love romancin' the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
It's a spicy kind of life  
Cre-o-la  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me

Well the years have come and gone  
Still the old song lingers on  
I keep it in my heart with fond affection  
Like the family good luck charm  
That keeps away the harm  
Creola's always there for my protection  
  
(CHORUS 3)  
Creola, good for your soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola

You fall in love ramancin' the melody

Jimmy Buffett,Cuban Crime Of Passion,/j/jimmy+buffett/cuban+crime+of+passion_20071800.html,"Well now Billy Voltaire was a Piano player, up from Miami way.  
He used to play in the bars, he could should like the stars,  
And the Lady's would pay and pay.  
Well one night, he did wind up  
Playin' in Havana town.  
And nobody knew, least Billy Voltaire that these were his final sounds  
  
He met up with Marita, a dancer in from the coast.  
Half woman, half child, she drove him half wild  
He loved that lady the most.  
Well one night, he did find her  
In the arms of Shrimper Dan  
So Billy pulled out a knife, took poor Danny's life,  
And then he turned his own cold hand.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just a Cuban crime of passion,  
Messy and old fashioned.  
Yeah, that's what the papers did say.  
It's just a Cuban crime of passion,  
Anjejo and knives a slashin'.  
Yeah but that's what the people like to read about,  
Up in America, up in America.  
  
Well they never found Marita,  
Some people say she got ill.  
Billy Voltaire had no one to claim him,  
He was buried on pauper's hill.  
And no one talks about 'em no more,  
It happned just a week ago.  
But people get by and people get high,  
In the tropics, they come in they go.

I'm a cultural infidel, painting in the dark  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing in the park  
Socrates, hypothesis, the music of Mozart  
I'm a cultural infidel, coming from the heart  
  
Free thinkin', hoodwinkin', unblinkin' man  
Start trouble, burst bubbles, join my caravan  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, I guess it could be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel trying to draw a crowd  
I'm a cultural infidel, singing right out loud  
Philosophy is not for me, laughing is my game  
I'm a cultural infidel, slap me with the blame  
  
Loose cannon, Armageddon, preachers at the door  
Spittin' poison at the boys 'n girls on dance floor  
I hear them in the congress, I see them on TV  
I hope the Inquisition remains a memory

Al'Diablo Fontainebleau, Al'Diable Hemingway  
O'Diab Dr. Thompson, O'Diab St. Joan  
O'Diab Village Paeople, O'Diab Rolling Stones  
Someone's got to talk about accountability  
Someone's got to raise some hell, it might as well be me  
  
I'm a cultural infidel, believe in common sense  
I'm a cultural infidel, love the present tense  
But we have to keep a look out for those mean old backed-up farts  
I'm a cultural infidel, comin' from the heart  
  
My heart, my heart, mon coeur  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you in Rio, only time will tell  
  
Will I see you in Heaven, will I see you in Hell  
Will I see you tomorrow, only time will tell

It's the ways of her father  
If she's gonna change she hasn't done it yet  
And the desert is calling to me  
Run before the final trap is set  
All roads lead to the city  
Where the dudes and the dykes all look the same  
Lady lays out the pattern  
With the parts of her body that seem tame  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Act like a child and I'll respond with my well-rehearsed farewell  
Quoting the verse that you bought but weren't quite prepared to sell  
Saying I think I love you  
Maybe I care  
It's not fair  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
And it's a sore spot when the room's burning hot  
And the desert air just cannot bring you down  
Still the bed's warm but a cold arm  
Keeps me floating inches off the ground  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Go paint your toes wipe you nose and then come to say goodbye  
And all along tell yourself I am wrong if I try  
Crying sorry it's over  
I'm not to blame  
What a game  
Death valley lives now I'm not even sure what really gives

Was to the end of the block  
I didn't know then  
That it never would stop  
Mow I look around  
And what do I see  
More and more people  
Running faster then me  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
When I fell in love  
For the very first time  
I couldn't keep up  
With that girl of mine  
On a mighty fast track  
She ran like the wind  
And she never looked back  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
Now I've been to England  
And I've been to France  
I've learned to love oysters  
And I know how to dance  
Someday I'll die  
And come back again  
As some little boy  
Just running to win  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
  
Look in the mirror  
And what do I see  
The gypsy and fool that I always will be  
These days  
Everybody's on the run  
These days  
Everybody's on the run

Jimmy Buffett,Far Side Of The World,/j/jimmy+buffett/far+side+of+the+world_20666870.html,"Ramadan is over,  
The new moon's shown her face,  
I'm halfway round the planet,  
In a most unlikely place.  
  
Following my song line  
Past bamboo shacks and shops  
Behind a jitney packed like sardines,  
With bananas piled on top.  
  
I ran away from politics,  
It's too bizarre at home.  
Away I flew, tuned into Blue  
""Maybe Amsterdam or Rome""  
  
Awakened by a stewardess,  
With Spain somewhere below.  
On the threshold of adventure,  
God I do love this job so.  
  
So while I make my move  
On the big board game  
Up and down a Spanish highway,  
Some things remain the same.  
Girls meet boys  
and the boys tease girls  
I'm heading out this morning,  
For the Far Side of the World.  
  
Oh I believe in song lines  
Obvious and not  
I'd ridden them like camels  
To some most peculiar spots.  
  
They run across the oceans  
Through mountains and saloons  
And tonight out to the dessert  
Where I sit atop this dune.  
  
I was destined for this vantage point  
Which is so far from the Sea  
I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery  
  
From Paris to Tunisia  
Casablanca to Dakar  
I was riding long before I flew  
Through the wind and sand and stars.  
  
Caravan  
Ride that hump  
And Timbuktu's a jillion bumps  
Sleeping bags and battle flags  
Are coiled and furled  
That's the way you travel  
To the far side of the world!  
  
A Sunset framed by lightening bolts  
Burns a lasting memory  
And a string of tiny twinkling lights  
adorn the sausage tree.  
While the embers from the log fire  
Flicker, fly, and twirl  
Then drift off toward the cosmos  
From the Far Side of the World.  
Well it's Christmas and my birthday  
and so to that extent  
The Masai not the wise men  
Are circling my tent.  
I teach them how to play guitar  
They show me how to dance  
We have rum from the Caribbean  
And Burgundy from France.  
  
New Year's Eve in Zanzibar  
With Babu and his boys  
High up on the rooftop  
You can relish all the noise.  
  
They are dancing on the tables  
People bouncing like gazelles  
Two 0-0-1 is ushered in  
With air raid horns and bells.  
  
Time to sing time to dance  
Living out my second chance.  
  
Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.  
  
Back at home, it's afternoon  
Six thousand miles away.  
I will still be there when I get through  
Attending this soiree  
  
There are jobs and chores and questions  
And plates I need to twirl,  
But tonight I'll take my chances,  
On the Far Side of the World.  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.

Jimmy Buffett,God Don't Own A Car,/j/jimmy+buffett/god+dont+own+a+car_10149963.html,"By: jimmy buffett, buzz cason  
1971  
I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car  
He don't wear no fancy clothes  
He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

And I swore I'd never do it again  
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still  
  
While he went in to town to vote  
It was right up on the mountain  
Where the map said it would be  
Friends let me tell you one thing,  
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still  
It stood up on that mountainside  
Like a hugh golden opal  
  
God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens  
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man  
But temptation got the best of me  
And I took a slash  
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat  
Like honey dew vine water  
And I took another slash,  
Took another'n an another'n an another'n  
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit  
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes  
  
Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body  
And a feelin' came over me  
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before  
It was like, like I was in love  
  
In love for the first time, with anything that moved  
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter  
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off  
In my brain sayin' ""Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'""  
'Cause I was drunk  
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'  
Commode huggin' drunk  
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man  
  
And that's when I first saw the bear  
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall  
He rambled up over the hill  
Expectin' me to do one of two things,  
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one  
It hung him up  
  
He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear  
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause  
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man  
It hung him up  
  
He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes  
Was a lot redder than his was  
It hung him up  
  
So I approached him, I said ""Mr. Bear, I love  
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body  
I know you got a lot of friends over there  
On the other side of the hill  
  
There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear  
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear,  
Pokey the bear  
  
I want you to go back over there tonight  
And tell them I'm feelin' right  
You tell them I love each and everyone of them  
Like a brother and a sister  
  
But if they give me any trouble tonight  
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill""  
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think  
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious  
Well hell I approached him again  
  
I said ""Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord  
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it  
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear""  
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw  
And I led him over to the still  
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause  
He's smellin' somethin' good  
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water  
He downed it up right  
  
Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus  
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight  
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n  
For I knew it he downed eight of them  
And commenced to doin' the bear dance  
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt  
It was so simple like the jitter bug  
It plum evaded me  
  
We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar  
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside  
And I laid down and went to sleep  
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams  
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon  
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'  
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off  
In the heavens  
  
My buddy the bear was a missin'  
Want to know something else friends and neighbors

Jimmy Buffett,I Will Play For Gumbo,/j/jimmy+buffett/i+will+play+for+gumbo_20071848.html,"I don't smoke, I don't shoot smack  
But I got a spicy monkey ridin' on my back.  
Don't eat beignets, too much sugar and dough,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo  
  
It started at my Grandma's kitchen by the sea,  
She warned me when she told me ""son the first one's free""  
It hit me like a rock or some Taikwondo,  
Cause I will play for gumbo  
Oh yea, I will play for gumbo.  
Chorus  
A piece of French bread  
With which to wipe my bowl,  
Good for the body.  
Good for the soul.  
It's a little like religion  
And a lot like sex.  
You should never know  
When you're gonna get it next.  
At midnight in the quarter or noon in Thibadeaux  
I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo.  
  
I'm not talkin' quesadillas or a dozen Krispy Kremes,  
Or a pound of caviar that's a rich man's dream.  
No banana split or fillet of pompano.  
No, I will play for gumbo,  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
Chorus  
Maybe it's the sausage or those pretty pink shrimp  
Or that popcorn rice that makes me blow up like a blimp.  
Maybe it's that voodoo from Marie Leveaux,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
  
The sauce boss does his cookin' on the stage,  
Stirrin' and a singing for his nightly wage.  
Sweating and frettin' from his head to his toe,  
Playin' and swayin' with the gumbo  
Prayin' and buffetin' with the gumbo

Out the lights.  
  
Go to bed wake up with a clear head  
Recalling what made it a ball  
If I could just get it on paper  
I might make some sense of it all  
  
If I could tell half of the stories  
The funny way most things begin  
Figure ways to disguise all the half truths and lies  
Find the heart of my song with the point of a pen  
Simple words can be come clever phrases  
And chapters could turn into books  
Yes if I could just get it on paper  
But it's harder than it ever looks.  
  
All alone in the edge of the water  
Hiding out by the Sea of Cortez  
With my sketch pads and Flairs  
Tapes and battery spares  
  
It's just no comprehend to what everyone says  
  
Time alone seemed to work well for Faulkner  
Time away seems to work for the kid  
Life and ink they run out at the same time  
Or so said my old friend the squid  
  
Yes if I could just get it on paper tonight  
I could tell you what I think I did.

And been out on the town way out on the town  
Way way way out If It All Falls Down

Lonely princess, all the days out  
On your own are growing empty.  
Nothin' is goin' well, if you  
Could only tell them how you feel.  
But they're too real to understand.  
  
Too many trite expressions ending in  
Forced rejection long ago.  
Too many innocent faces in too many  
Far-out places, something's wrong.  
  
Let me tell you that something's wrong.  
It's been that way so long, and it's a shame.  
  
On the street car to the city,  
Where she knows that she may lose it all,  
Riding for just a dime,  
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well  
That this could be her final fall,  
Past the boutique, to the alley,  
Down the river, people pass her by.  
She sits on the big gray rocks,  
Takes off her boots and socks,  
Not knowing what she will do next,  
Just starts to cry.  
  
To many wild rejections ending in  
Angry questions from her dad.  
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone  
Loves a winner, but she was lost.  
No ones knows the trials she had.  
  
In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,

Don't know, but I can't go back home.""

Pickup's washed and you just got paid  
With any luck you might even get laid  
Cause they're making and they're breaking  
On a Livingston Saturday night  
  
You got to listen to the sound of the hot country band  
Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand  
Sing a song play some pong, shoot a little pool  
Hitting on the honeys right out of high school  
Fifteen may get you twenty, that's all right  
Cause they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night

Where no bird flies by my window  
No ship is tied to my tree  
Love is a wave building to a crescendo  
Ride if you will, ride it with me  
  
I knew this girl made of memories and phrases  
Who lived her whole life in both chapters and stages  
Danced til the dawn, wished all her worries away  
  
Well she wasn't crazy no she wasn't mad  
She just wanted the father that she never had  
From under my lone palm I think about her today  
  
We sailed from the port of indecision  
Young and wild with oh so much to learn  
Days turn into years as we tried to fool our fears  
But to the port of indecision I returned

Come Christmas winds and blow all my worries away

The old doomsday fanatic wore a crown of kudzu  
Sirens where wailing in the gulf coastal heat  
And it seemed like the whole world was in forced retreat  
I paid no attention, revolved through the door  
Passed the newspaper rack on the worn marble floor  
Near civil war history my heart skipped a beat  
She was standing on fiction stretched high on bare feet  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
I was the pirate and she was the queen  
Sir Francis and Elizabeth the best there's ever been  
Then she strolled past my table and stopped at the stairs  
Then sent me a smile as she reached for Flaubert  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
She gathered her books, walked while she read  
Words never spoken but so much was said  
You can read all you want into this rendezvous  
But it's safer than most things that lovers can do  
Well stories have endings and fantasies fade  
The guard by the door starts drawing the shade  
So write your own ending and hope they come true  
For the lovers and strangers on Bay Avenue  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime

Long blonde hair and a tail in between

When we kiss there could be no wrong

To see the darkness, to listen within  
To answer in kindness, to ever begin  
To ever be gentle, to always be strong  
To walk in the wonder, to live in the song  
  
In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known  
Will the future remember when the lovers are gone?

Well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'  
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move  
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner  
When I came to Alaska the land that I love  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna  
Raised in hard times but I had a good life  
From the first time I flew with my father a singin'  
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.  
  
We sleep near the sound of a slow running river  
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain  
And we live every day like the first or the last one  
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Oh, for a fire on a cold winter's night  
Once more to gaze at the great northern lights  
For all of the beauty my children will see  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me  
Oh, here's to Alaska and me

John Denver,All My Memories,/j/john+denver/all+my+memories_20073318.html,"All of my memories lay in the life of the highway  
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone  
All of my days on the road with no one beside me  
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river  
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky  
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family  
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try  
  
Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways  
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze  
Some sweet taxi dancer's tryin' to save me from bein' alone  
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place that I really belong  
I want to be home  
  
I'm leavin' this city life In my mind I'm flyin' away  
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays  
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines  
I'm leavin' my sorrows and all of my memories behind  
To see what I find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to lay down and die

I had a '56 t-bird  
Then i was king of the highway  
Trying to make it look fast and easy  
And dreamin' of doin' it my way  
Let's put the top down baby  
Feel the wind in our hair  
  
We were too young to know better  
And too cool to care  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Rock and roll on the radio  
Let's turn it up and get down  
  
Convertible dreams running wild in the streets  
In the all time american town  
When you played the thrill queen, baby  
I heard the jazz of joy  
You were every girl in the world  
But i wasn't every boy  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Memory pink and charcoal grey  
Are the clours i painted this song  
You were 19 and perfect, baby  
But no one stays perfect too long  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride

His own way through the cold  
To come back again to all that you've been  
Can't you see that it's time to come home  
  
To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees

John Denver,Amsterdam,/j/john+denver/amsterdam_20073902.html,"In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings  
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunkin' down fight.  
But in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born  
On a muggy, hot morn by the dawns early light.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and tails.  
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon.  
That can swallow the moon that can haul up the sails.  
And he asks to the cook with his arms open wide.  
Bring me more fish, put it down by my side.  
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try.  
So he gets up and he laughs and he zips up his fly.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance.  
Haunches bursting their pants, binding woman to paunch.  
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks.  
And they're aplitting the night with the roar of their jokes.  
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust.  
To the rats it sounds of the accordion burst.  
Then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants.  
With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks.  
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again.  
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam.  
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men.  
And they darken their bodies and their virtue long gone  
For a few dirty coins. And then when he can't go on  
He plants his nose in the sky And he wipes it up above  
And he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.

You felt the urge of sun's light beams  
The muffled world of dolphin sound  
Slipped down and back into your dreams  
  
For nine full months that passed before  
You learned of all of life's ancient rhymes  
Then mother sensed a farther shore  
And brought you forth into these times  
  
So taste the air of your new world  
And gently guide us to your mind  
It knows the winds and sails unfurled  
And holds to heart the dolphin kind  
  
Welcome precious earth made child  
We met you first in your father's songs  
And mother's smile and waters wild  
It's in this place you now belong  
  
I know you know of all these things  
And feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh  
For you were born on silver wings  
To taste the high blown crystal sky  
  
To sing one day to all of us  
The songs you learned in dolphin lair  
Giving hope to life as all we must  
And teach us how their grace to share

But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside, it will soon fall apart  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing  
He who'd walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
Knows what it means to be a wealthy man  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Palaces will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away

She poured a cup of coffee and  
She brought it on a tray

You're the best idea I've had all day.""

And if there's time to sleep  
There's time to make love  
  
I came, I saw, I conquered  
But I rode off in the sun  
But I know the look she left with me  
Keeps telling me she won  
Her face is the only thing I see  
Whispering those words of prophesy  
  
I may come easy, but I don't come free  
You're never gonna see the last of me

As we go marching, marching  
In the beauty of the day  
A million darkened kitchens  
A thousand mill lofts grey  
Are touched with all the radiance  
That a sudden sun discloses  
For the people hear us singing  
Bread and roses, bread and roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We battle too for men  
For they are women's children  
And we mother them again  
Our lives shall not be sweetened  
From birth until life closes  
Hearts starve as well as bodies  
Give us bread, but give us roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We bring the greater days  
For the rising of the women  
Means the rising of the race  
No more the drudge and idler  
Ten that toil where one reposes  
But the sharing of life's glories

John Denver,Casey's Last Ride,/j/john+denver/caseys+last+ride_20073324.html,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin'  
Down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below  
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened coridors  
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul  
  
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain  
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains  
  
""Oh"", she said ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you""  
""Here"" she said, ""Just a kiss to make a body smile""  
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""  
""Lord"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay awhile""  
  
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown  
For somethin' wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones  
See'ing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home  
  
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter,  
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by  
Then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye  
  
""Oh"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me""  
""Now"" she said, ""Now that you've a family of your own""  
""Still"" she said, ""It's so blessed good to feel your body""

John Denver,Catch Another Butterfly,/j/john+denver/catch+another+butterfly_20073325.html,"Do you remember days  
Not so very long ago  
When the world was run by  
People twice your size  
And the days were full of laughter  
  
And the nights were full of stars  
And when you grew tired you  
Could close your eyes  
Yes the stars were were there for wishing  
And the wind was there for kites  
And the morning sun was  
There for rise and shine  
And even in the sniffles  
Kept you home from school in bed  
You couldn't hardly  
Stay there after nine  
  
And I wonder if the  
Smell of mornings faded  
  
What happened to the robins  
Song that sparkled in the sky  
Where's all the water gone  
That tumbled down the stream  
Will I ever catch another butterfly  
  
Right in your own backyard  
Wondering how airplanes could fly  
And the hours spent just playing  
With a funny rock you found  
With crystal specks as  
Blue as all the sky  
  
Now I watch my son  
He's playing with his toys  
He's happy and I  
Give him all I can  
But I can't help feeling  
Just a lime inside  
When to hear him say  
He wants to be a man

Was given to us all  
To smell the rose's fragrance  
To hear the songbird's call  
To watch the distant moonlight fill  
The coming of the tides  
To understand that life is more  
Than always choosing sides  
  
And some have seen what can be seen  
Of sailing ships and kings  
And some are given feet of clay  
And some are given wings  
And some must struggle just to breathe  
Some have a golden spoon  
And some will never leave the nest  
While some walk on the moon  
  
And don't you know the life that lives  
Within the silent hills  
Is just as rich and beautiful  
And just as unfulfilled  
As man with all his intellect  
His reason and his choice  
Oh, who's to say the nightingale  
Has any less a voice  
  
The silver dolphins twist and dance  
And sing to one another  
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds  
For all that lives are brothers  
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear  
The elephant, the whale  
All children of the universe  
All weavers of the tale  
  
So palomino lie back down  
And dream yourself to sleep  
The hawk flies with the morning dove  
The lion with the sheep  
As far away as you may go  
We'll never be apart  
It's in your dreams that you will know  
The seasons of the heart

Football and eggnog and Christmas parades.  
I'll take my blanket, I'll take the reins,

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night,  
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights.  
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray,

Illinois Central, Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along a southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out of Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' towns that have no name  
Freight yards full of old black men  
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying, don't you know me I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel  
And mothers with their babes asleep  
Rockin' to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Night time on the City of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee  
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea  
But all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?

John Denver,Dance Little Jean,/j/john+denver/dance+little+jean_20073482.html,"Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and
groom  
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.  
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,  
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.  
  
Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her
dream  
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her,
dance little jean!  
  
They said:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant  
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had
spent.  
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little
jeanie's sake  
  
We played:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.

Dancin's just a thing to make you whole

I am one who dances with the wind  
I am one who dances on the ocean  
My partner's more than pieces more than friends  
  
Were you there the night they lost the lightning  
Were you there the day the earth stood still  
Did you see the famous and the fighting  
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale

We are one when singing in the wind  
We are one when thinking of each other  
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends

I slept one rainy night with you in Paris  
Made up for a thousand wasted years  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
I close my eyes and you make love appear  
  
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier  
Shadows singing so low only we could hear  
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm  
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm  
  
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder  
Now I wake and find you're never there  
I'm becoming old enough to wonder  
Happy that I'm still too young to care  
  
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down  
Refugees and fantasies go underground  
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away  
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday  
  
Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris  
we were part of some artist's design  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
In the gray around me how you shine

John Denver,Falling Out Of Love,/j/john+denver/falling+out+of+love_20073557.html,"This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
First of all there's no one to talk to  
When there is they just don't seem to hear  
Words don't seem to matter much anyway  
They can't describe the pain  
They can't explain the fear  
  
Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through  
Still you hate to see the morning come  
Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore  
The future holds no promise  
Your life's already done  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
The you find your heart no longer flutters  
You no longer look through a lover's eyes  
What's to see when the world falls down around you  
You simply can't believe it  
But it comes as no surprise  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
What's the sense of failure  
It's such an incredible loss  
It's all the things you'll never do  
And all the dreams that will never come true  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
Oh this is just the way a true love ends  
I don't believe a true love ever ends

Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
I'm the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
See what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldn't change a thing  
  
Welcome to my happiness  
You know it makes me smile  
And it pleases me to have you here  
For just a little while  
While we open up the spaces  
Try to break some chains  
And if the truth is told  
They will never come again  
  
Welcome to my evening  
The closing of the day  
I could try a million times  
Never find a better way  
To tell you that I love you  
And all the songs I play  
Are to thank you for allowing me  
Inside this lovely day  
  
Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
Yes, I'm the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
And see what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldn't change a thing

John Denver,Flight,/j/john+denver/flight_10151779.html,"This song was first released on the it's about time album. it is the only
album it has been released on.  
  
  
Oh, i have slipped the surly bonds of earth  
And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings  
Sunward i've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth  
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things  
I've wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence  
Hovering there i've chased the shouting winds aloft  
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air  
  
The higher we fly, the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night, the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers  
  
Up, up, the long delirious burning blue  
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace  
Where never lark nor even eagle flew  
And while with silent lifting mind i trod  
The high untresspassed sanctity of space  
Put out my hand and touched the face of god  
  
The higher we fly, the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night, the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers

John Denver,Fly Away,/j/john+denver/fly+away_20073746.html,"All of her days have gone soft and cloudy  
All of her dreams have gone dry  
All of her nights have gone sad and shady  
She's getting ready to fly  
  
Fly away fly away fly away.  
  
Life in the city can make you crazy  
For sounds of the sand and the sea  
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry  
For things that you can't even see  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.  
  
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she  
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere  
That she'd rather be.  
  
She's looking for lovers and children playing  
She's looking for signs of the spring  
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing  
She listens for any old things  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

John Denver,Follow Me,/j/john+denver/follow+me_20073862.html,"It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
It's long been on my mind  
You know it's been a long, long time  
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand  
The way I feel about you and just how much I need you  
To be there where I can talk to you  
When there's no one else around  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
You see I'd like to share my life with you  
And show you things I've seen  
Places that I'm going to places where I've been  
To have you there beside me and never be alone  
And all the time that you're with me  
We will be at home  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me

John Denver,For Baby,/j/john+denver/for+baby_10151999.html,"Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your hand  
Ill do anything to keep you satisfied  
Ill love you more than anybody can  
  
And the wind will whisper your name to me  
Little birds will sing along in time  
Leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill be there when you're feelin down  
To kiss away the fears if you cry  
Ill share with you all the happiness I've found  
A reflection of the love in your eyes  
  
And Ill sing you the songs of the rainbow  
A whisper of the joy that is mine  
And leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your tiny hand  
Ill do anything to help you understand  
And Ill love you more than anybody can

Leaves will bow down when you walk by

John Denver,For You,/j/john+denver/for+you_20073789.html,"Just a look in your eyes again  
Just to lay in your arms  
Just to be the first one always there for you  
Just to live in your laughter  
Just to sing in your heart  
Just to be everyone of your dreams come true  
  
Just to sit by your window  
Just to touch in the night  
Just to offer a prayer each day for you  
Just to long for your kisses  
Just to dream of your sighs  
Just to know that I'd give my life for you  
  
For you for the rest of my life  
For you all the best of my life  
For you alone, only for you  
  
Just to wake up each morning  
Just to you by my side  
Just to know that you're never really far away  
Just a reason for living  
Just to say I adore  
Just to know that you're here in my heart to stay  
  
For you for the rest of my life  
For you all the best of my life  
For you alone, only for you  
  
Just the words of a love song  
Just the beat of my heart  
Just the pledge of my life, my love, for you

John Denver,Four Strong Winds,/j/john+denver/four+strong+winds_20073483.html,"Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to working for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
If I get there before the snowflies, and if things are going good  
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do  
And the wind sure blows cold way out there  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
Yes our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
But I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

John Denver,Goodbye Again,/j/john+denver/goodbye+again_20073863.html,"It's five o'clock this morning, and the sun is on the rise  
There's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes  
The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone  
And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
It seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and warm  
I long to lay me down again, to hold you in my arms  
I long to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile  
Other voices beckon me, to go a little while  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
Have to go and see some friends of mine, some that I don't know  
Some who aren't familiar with my name,  
It's something that's inside of me not hard to understand  
It's anyone who listens to me sing  
  
And if your hours are empty now, who am I to blame  
You think if I were always here, our love would be the same  
As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone  
And lying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever known  
  
But it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave

John Denver,Gospel Changes,/j/john+denver/gospel+changes_10151883.html,"The prodigal son, he'd been away awhile  
He was workin' his way back home now  
Over many a ragged mile  
When he finally crossed the river  
And his father saw him near  
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
People tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jesus, He did not doubt His gift  
Though He knew that He had not long to live  
He took care of the business  
Teaching us how to fly  
Then He bowed His head  
And laid down to die  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jerusalem, I see is standin' high  
But if you lose your salvation  
There'll be no tears left to cry  
Now some men worship a golden calf  
While others are bought and sold  
And if we live like that, brother, we pay the toll  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down

Still goin' down  
Still goin' down  
Still goin' down

John Denver,Got My Heart Set On You,/j/john+denver/got+my+heart+set+on+you_20073445.html,"Ever since the day I met you  
I feel like I'm walking on air  
And lately I'm convinced it's no coincidence  
I run into into you everywhere  
  
And though I've heard your love is taken  
I gotta believe what's in your eyes  
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time  
And we got together one of these nights?  
  
[Chorus]  
Got my heart set on you  
You're everything I've ever wanted  
Got my heart set on you  
Can't be anything but love  
Baby, I'm bettin' on it  
  
I don't want to give you the wrong impression  
I'm not the kind who rushes in  
But, baby, every time I see you, before I even leave you  
I can hardly wait to see you again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mean to be coming on strong  
Or taking everything for granted  
But love is a thing that just comes along  
You don't understand how it got out of hand  
But you're in it right from the start

John Denver,Grandma's Feather Bed,/j/john+denver/grandmas+feather+bed_20073638.html,"When I was a little bitty boy just up off the floor  
We used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so  
We'd have chicken pie, country ham  
Homemade butter on the bread  
But the best darn thing about grandma's house  
Was the great big feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
  
After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew  
Pa would talk about the farm and the war  
And granny'd sing a ballad or two  
And I'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head  
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning  
In the middle of the old feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
  
Well, I love my ma and I love my pa, I love granny and grandpa too  
I've been fishin' with my uncles, I wrestled my cousin  
I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!  
But if I ever had to make a choice I guess it oughta be said  
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road  
For grandma's feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed
