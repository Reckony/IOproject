Judds,In My Dreams,/j/judds/in+my+dreams_20076332.html,"In my dreams  
You belong to me  
She doesn't mean a thing  
She never wore your ring  
In my dreams  
My greatest wish comes true  
My arms are holding you  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear your laughter  
And I taste your lips  
I feel you tremble  
At my fingertips  
Each night you're mine  
But each morning finds you gone  
  
In my dreams  
My soul is wide awake  
Craving the love we make  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my dreams  
I'll hide this love I steal  
'Til you feel what my heart feels  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams

Judds,Isn't He A Strange One,/j/judds/isnt+he+a+strange+one_20076342.html,"I want to tell 'bout my lover  
And I want to tell you 'bout my best friend  
Compared to all the others  
He's a little bit different  
A friend saw him on the town  
Said he was turnin' all the pretty girls down  
She said, ""You really should be proud of him.""  
  
[Chorus]  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks comin' on to me is a whole lot of fun  
He doesn't want anybody else but me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks I hung the moon  
He's pretty sure I was the one  
And I'm glad he'll never be  
  
A stranger to me  
I know he's one in a million  
When he says I'm the one that he's dreamin' of  
I hope he doesn't wake up anytime soon  
From this honeymoon  
My girlfriends are turnin' green with envy  
They want to know are there anymore at home like him  
Cupid must be really watchin' over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I' m glad he'll never be  
A stranger to me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
Isn't he a strange one?

Judds,John Deere Tractor,/j/judds/john+deere+tractor_20076343.html,"Dear Mama, well here's a letter from your girl  
Well I think my city days are done gone  
And it ain't been three weeks since I came  
And Mama, do remember what you said  
Say your prayers before you go to bed child  
And remember city boys ain't the same

In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I wish I was home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the sweet country boys don't complain  
And mama, so much perfume  
I thought I drank  
And the lord didn't seem to be nowhere around  
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I'd like to be home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the light shimmers and it shines  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field

Judds,Let Me Tell You About Love,/j/judds/let+me+tell+you+about+love_20076301.html,"Well ever since the day that time began  
There's been this thing 'tween a woman and a man  
We'll, I don't know but I do believe  
It started in the garden with Adam and Eve  
Sampson and Delilah had their fling  
'Til she cut his hair and clipped his wing  
It don't matter how the story's told  
Love stays young it can't grow old

Let me tell you about love  
About the moon and stars above  
It's what we've all been dreamin' of  
Let me tell you about love  
  
Well, Bonaparte and Josephine  
I believe they had a pretty good scene  
Until she said Bonnie boy, we're through  
That's when he met his Waterloo  
Julie baby and Romeo  
Fell in love and stole the show  
I know they are history  
But there ain't been nothin' like you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Sheba she was a beauty queen  
The purtiest thing that you ever have seen  
Solomon he was a mighty wise  
Sheba she done caught his eye  
The world would be in a dreadful fix  
If it wasn't for the love between the cats and chicks  
The world wouldn't amount to much  
Without a hug and a kiss and a tender touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me tell you about love  
Let me tell you about love  
Yeah

In your sea of broken dreams

Love can build a bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a bridge

I would whisper love so loudly, every heart could understand  
That love and only love can join the trials of man  
I would give my heart's desire so that you might see  
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me.

We can do anything, anything  
We're believing in the power

Judds,Mr. Pain,/j/judds/mr+pain_10154863.html,"Met my first love down in Texas  
In a club in San Anton'  
Both of us were lonely  
Had no one to call our own  
So we danced and laughed 'til closin' time  
And had no place to go  
So with the top pulled down, drove all night  
Run off to Mexico  
But my blond haired blue eyed cowboy  
Turned out to be bad news  
Disappeared one morning  
Left his old boots and the blues  
Now there's been so many others  
But none of them were true  
The only one I could count on  
To keep me company is you

Mr. Pain, oh, it's you again  
Never really wanted us to be such friends  
You always seem to show up  
When I'm all alone  
That's when you move right in  
And make yourself at home  
Mr. Pain, Oh, Mr. Pain  
  
We'll you'd think by now that I'd have learned  
To see through your disguise  
A heartache really shouldn't be  
So hard to recognize  
But you wear so many face  
Every line is new  
And somehow I just always end up  
Wakin' up with you

'Cause without her where would he be?

She is his only need  
  
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder  
A new promotion every now and then  
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron  
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children  
And my, how the time did fly  
The babies grew up and moved away  
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking  
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray  
  
And every once in a while you could see him get up  
And he's head downtown  
'Cause he heard about something she wanted  
And it just had to be found  
Didn't matter how simple or how much  
It was love  
And, boy, ain't that love just something  
When it's strong enough to keep a man goin?  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them  
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard  
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted  
'Cause without her where would he be?

When you get the blues in the night  
  
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind of song  
He knows things are wrong, and he's right  
  
From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow  
I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I
know  
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in
the night  
  
My mama was right, there's blues in the night

Bravely marching forward two by two...

With the same dream in their eyes.

Hear him, what a song  
Joy he's bringing, singing to me  
Singing, all day long  
Goodbye to skies of gray  
For I'm back home today...  
All day long I jump and run about  
You can always hear me shoutin' out  
""Hello bluebird!""  
Got no time for blues or anything  
I'm so happy, I just want to sing  
""Hello bluebird!""  
Blue skies, sun shine  
Friends that are real  
Old folks, sweetheart  
Oh, how I feel!  
I'll not go roaming like I did again  
I'll stay home and be a kid again  
""Hello bluebird, hello!""  
All day long  
I keep singing  
""Hello, I'm glad I found you, bluebird""  
Make yourself at home...  
No more blues  
Just because I'm happy  
When I'm around you, bluebird  
No more need to roam  
Up above the sun is shining  
The World is ideal  
I just can't describe the marvelous way  
That I feel...  
With nothing but the bluest skies above  
What a rosy future lies ahead  
Thank you, bluebird!  
Happy, happy, bluebird!  
Mister Bluebird, hello!

Judy Garland,Hoe Down,/j/judy+garland/hoe+down_20492004.html,"When our Grandmas and our Grandpas where just girls and boys  
The seemed to have a lot more fun than we

And the big event was called a husking bee  
A banjo and a fiddle and a big old fashioned barn  
Was all the preparation that they made  
And if they tell you otherwise, dismiss it as a yarn  
Refreshments were confined to lemonade  
Now you may say it' corny.  
And I guess I must agree  
But it was good enough for Grandma, it was good enough for Grandpa  
And it' good enough for me  
Hoe down! The country' gone Hoe Down  
It' puttin it'' toe down and kickin it' heels  
Hoe Down. It' really a rare dance. A pioneer square dance  
But with a new deal  
One, two, swing your partner lightly. While you hold her ever so tightly  
And bring your best beau down  
We havin a show down and gotta make hast  
'cause hoe down' on it' way  
Stand in line and do the Turkey, like a Yankee Doodle Dandy  
When you turkey do it jerky, that' the trick, now your hoein on down  
Sashay, sashay, sashay around while your hoein on down  
Form a circle in the middle, everybody Allemande  
Boys keep tempo with the fiddle and your gal in the calico gown  
Whoa ho, whoa ho, whoa ho around in your calico gown  
Do-si-do around, it very romantic  
Do-si-do  
Do-si-do some more and maybe she'll fall  
Now it time to do your honors  
Then when your done your honors, promenade the hall!

Life can be a joy,

Will depend on little pleasures they will share,  
So let us compare.  
  
I like New York in June, how about you?  
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?  
I love a fireside when a storm is due.  
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,  
How about you?  
  
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,  
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.  
Holding hands at the movie show,  
When all the lights are low  
May not be new, but I like it,  
How about you?  
  
I like Jack Benny's jokes,  
To a degree.  
I love the common folks,  
That includes me.  
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue,  
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,  
How about you?  
  
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine,  
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.  
I can see we're in harmony,  
Looks like we both agree  
On what to do,  
And I like it, how about you?  
  
I'm so delighted I've ignited the spark within you.  
Let me continue to make it burn.  
With you I will be like a Trilby, so let's not dally.  
Come on Svengali, I've lots to learn.  
When you're arisin', start exercisin' daily.  
For example, just a sample?  
Bend and touch the floor fifty times or more.  
Ha! A fine start to be a Bernhardt!  
  
A dictionary's necessary but not for talking,  
It's used for walking the Ziegfeld way.  
Is this okay?  
That's the trick, you're catching on quickly.  
Should I take a bow?  
A-ho! Let me show you how!  
Just like partners on the stage.  
If you can use a partner,  
I'm the right age.

Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself when I grow out of this ugly-
duckling stage.  
And you're no Clark Gable yourself.  
But that's all right.  
Don't worry about me, I'll recover.  
Time is a great healer.  
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball, and  
I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps,  
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes, you'll probably be sorry.  
And you'll probably realize that life is just an idiot's delight.  
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion,  
I can only say thanks - thanks for the memory.  
  
I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,  
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.

The faint aroma - of performing seals  
The double-crossing - of a pair of heels

Judy Garland,Mack The Black,/j/judy+garland/mack+the+black_20252398.html,"There's a pirate, known to fame  
Black Macocco was the Pirate's name  
In his day, the tops was he  
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea  
When he sites a clipper ship  
Mack would board her and begin to clip  
First he'd grab, the ladies fair  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
Especially those with jewels  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
With his ladies and his loot  
Next Macocco from the ship would scoot  
Then he'd set the ship afire...what a pretty funeral  
Funeral pyre!  
Mack the Black, what a pretty funeral  
Mack the Black, marvelous funeral pyre!  
Though the years this black Macocco  
Lead his pirate reign  
His claim to fame was as black as his name  
All around the Spanish Maine  
When he'd a make his daily rounds  
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds  
Ev'ry night he'd have a date Ladies go to pieces  
Over pieces of eight.  
Hey!  
Sleep my baby, baby sleep  
Time for babe to be in slumber deep  
If you wake or cry or laugh  
Mack the Black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya in half!  
Mack the black will really whack  
Mack the black will whack ya!  
Mack the black would really have to  
Whack ya in half!  
Mack the Black will really whack ya,  
Mack the Black will whack ya!  
Mack the black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya!  
Aaaaaah! Mack was ruthless  
Mack was feared  
Perhaps it's better that he disappeared  
Yet I know, that he was bad  
I could fall in love with,  
Fall in love with the lad!  
Evening star, if you see Mack  
Stop his wanderings and guide him back  
I'll be waiting, patiently  
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea.  
Is that the Caribbean Sea?  
And if I met this famous pirate  
Met him face to face  
You think I'd run and hide my head  
And scream around the place  
Why no I'd just sashay around  
Displaying all my charms  
And soon I'd have him walk the plank  
Right into my arms  
That's what I think of Mack the Black Macocco!

I'm gonna tell you a story  
And there's no moral to be made  
But don't forget when your dancing  
That somehow the piper must be paid  
  
Down on the Nile in the southern sea's  
There lives a lassy named Minne Breeze  
And all the natives agree that she's  
The hottest thing in Trinidad  
  
When Minne dances I guarantee  
With every move of her vertebrae  
The temperature jump up ten degree  
In Trinidad that isn't bad  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives would be so sad  
If Minne ever left Trinidad  
  
Although the natives loved Minne so  
Minne had herself a steady bow  
A fellow known as Calypso Joe  
And Minnie swore they'd never part  
  
But they stepped in only as they could  
Min won a contest for dancing good  
So she went away to Hollywood  
When Joe heard that, it broke his heart  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, she wasn't good but she wasn't bad  
Aye, aye, aye, Calypso Joe was so very sad  
When Minne up and left Trinidad  
  
In Hollywood Minne traveled far  
They changed her name to Minne Lamar  
And pretty soon she became a star  
The siren of the picture show  
  
But one day Minne got awful mad  
A guy got fresh and she said ""You cad""  
My heart belongs to my Trinidad  
My Trinidad Calypso Joe  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, in Hollywood Minne met her cad  
Aye, aye, aye, but there is only one native lad  
Gets chinny with Minne from Trinidad  
  
So Minnie gave up her dough and fame  
And she went back to from where she came  
But when she got there she heard with shame  
That her Calypso Joe was dead  
  
When Minne heard that, she almost died  
She took a gun to try suicide  
But as she started to shoot  
She cried, ""I think I'd rather live instead""  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, she went away and they were so sad  
Aye, aye, aye, but now the natives are mighty glad  
'Cause Minne came back to Trinidad  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives will be so sad  
If Minne, Minne came back to Trinidad

Judy Garland,My Intuition,/j/judy+garland/my+intuition_20491988.html,"I've read your pretty speaches  
And I must admit they touched my heart  
I don't know where you borrow them  
But most of them are works of art  
  
No school boy with his Valentines  
Was ever more sincere  
I've tried to read between the lines  
To make the meaning clear  
  
But there's a little voice that whispers  
Softly, as I fall asleep:  
""You better look before you leap.""  
  
My intuition says to me,  
Don't ever give your heart away  
And so I simply must obey my intuition  
  
My intuition says to me  
Those pretty words may not be true  
So what am I supposed to do in my position?  
  
I'd like to trust my heart  
Believe in just my heart  
But it is much too young to know  
  
So though it may be bad advice  
I guess I'll have to string along  
Until you prove my intuition  
Can be wrong.  
  
My intuition goes like this:  
I'm playing poker with a bunch  
And all at once I get a hunch  
That's intuition  
  
I'm playing aces back to back  
And I can see a pair of kings  
But if there's one more of those things  
What's my position?  
  
Well, if you get the cards  
Then you should bet the cards  
At least, that's what I've always heard  
  
You have your hunch, I'll have mine  
Suppose we both we both just string along  
Until we prove our intuition can be wrong.

It's time to wake 'em up below!  
So, when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky  
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly  
While rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky  
The world will wear a new bonnet  
Daffodils on it  
Thanks to the skies above  
Thunder and showers  
Wake up the flowers  
Where there are flowers  
There must be love  
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder  
Clouds will soon roll by  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go  
Round and round I go  
Like a leaf caught in a tide  
I should stay away but what can I do  
I hear your name and I'm a flame  
  
Flame, flame of desire  
Only your kiss can put out the fire  
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for  
Your the mate that fate had me created for  
And every time your lips meet mine  
  
Down and down I go  
Round and round I go  
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

That you heard up north in spring,  
Yes, sir! That's the good old sunny south.

And your feet want to dance,  
Where the close of each day  
Brings a night of romance.  
Where you meet those gals that sweetly drawl,  
""Mighty glad to meet you all.""

Doesn't try to please me  
Doesn't even tease me

Instead of Brahms it's ""Begin the Begin""

Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, and they don't know which,  
'Cause anything can happen when they start to rock.  
  
The philharmonic was so dignified  
But now they're groovy and starting to ride,  
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall

And when the Maestro gives them a beat, it's a  
Reet Beat that starts 'em to toot with a

And lost my heart instead.  
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie,  
He was quite the handsomest of men.  
I started to yen so I counted to ten  
Then I counted to ten again.  
  
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley,  
Ding, ding, ding went the bell,  
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings,  
From the moment I saw him I fell.  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Bump, bump, bump went the brake,  
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings,  
When he smiled I could feel the car shake.  
He tipped his hat, and took a seat.  
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet.  
He asked my name, I held my breath.  
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death.  
  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Pop, pop, pop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels,  
When the universe reels.  
  
The day was bright, the air was sweet,  
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet.  
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak,  
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak.  
  
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer,  
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to leave,  
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand,  
And as if it were planned,  
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand  
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line.

At school on the playground

And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Bridge]  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself

Yeah you say I'm crazy? guess that makes two

Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu

Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory

And I promise girl, I will do what I can  
To let you know that I am a changed man  
Verse 2  
You tell your friends, that you don't know, what ima do next  
You're scared of me, no need to be, it's not like I'm your ex

Certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess that they don't really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still, let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them

And you'll be all alone  
I constantly fight my insecurities  
When I can't reach you by phone  
And oh lord knows that I'm only human  
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions  
I know that you truly love me,  
But, fear has me second guessing

You the one I've been feignin' for  
When I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of you  
When you're gone, I've been screaming for ya  
  
So why don't you be my chick and stuff  
Take you out to dinner and catch the funky stuff  
Can we spend time, I'll never get enough  
You're so fine, make a dark brother blush  
  
Got me looking like a black grape and stuff  
First time saying you had me gonna crush  
And if you ever give it to me  
Give it to me rough  
  
You got me saying (you got me saying)  
Got me saying damn

Justin Timberlake,Dead And Gone,/j/justin+timberlake/dead+and+gone_20759021.html,"[Chorus]  
Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long  
Just trying to find, my way back home  
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone  
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long  
Just trying to find, my way back home  
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone  
  
Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home  
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on  
You walk by, they get wrong you reply  
Then shit get blown  
Way outta proportion, way past discussion  
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em  
Figure you'll get jumped  
That next, they don't wanna stop  
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance  
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion  
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya  
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound  
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,  
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys  
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you  
Could fuck around, get shot die any day  
Niggas die, every day all over  
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit  
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music  
Or did the ones, with the good sense  
Not use it, usually niggas  
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall  
So they just start shootin'  
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,  
From Bankhead or from your projects  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take time to think,  
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy  
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it  
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen  
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'  
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'  
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'  
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad  
Now think about damn, what a life I had  
Most of that shit, look back just laugh  
Some shit, still look back just sad  
Maybe my homeboy, till be around  
Had I not, hit the nigga  
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war  
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door  
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more  
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more  
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more  
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure  
Now think before I risk my life  
Take them chances to get my stripe  
A nigga put his hands on me alright  
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night  
Cause I hit you, you sue me,  
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take  
Time to think, before I make mistakes  
Just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday  
The heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say  
The old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright

I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
  
Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport  
'n told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door  
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for[??]  
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more  
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug  
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love  
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was  
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother??  
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'  
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening  
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin'  
Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined  
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built  
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt  
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt  
Y'all matter less everytime this margarita tilt

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear  
Get some show money from ugly and buy a keg of beer  
And another pig to give my other pigs some company  
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary  
In due time, but there's business left to attend to  
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to  
And another? Before my great aunt Missy  
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy  
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about  
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout  
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good  
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could  
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy  
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me  
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop  
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen???  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
  
I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery  
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be  
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally  
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be  
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable  
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable  
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual  
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable  
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now  
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found  
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown  
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny

Pretty girls that like my rhymes

She grabs the yellow bottle  
She likes the way it hits her lips  
She gets to the bottom  
It sends her on a trip so right  
She might be going home with me tonight  
  
She looks like a model  
Except she's got a little more ass  
Don't even bother  
Unless you've got that thing she likes  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
She's freaky, and she knows it  
She's freaky, but I like it  
  
She shuts the room down  
The way she walks and causes a fuss  
The baddest in town  
She's flawless like some uncut ice  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
And all she wants is to dance  
That's why you'll find her on the floor  
But you don't have a chance  
Unless you move the way that she likes  
That's why she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Now dance  
Little girl  
You're freaky, but I like it  
Hot damn!  
Let me put my funk on this one time  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows

She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I  
I'm love stoned, and I could swear  
That she knows  
Think that she knows, oh, oh

Talking real big with your little slim waist  
And with all that below your waist  
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder

If that pussy broke up The Beatles  
Told yah, ruined pop culture  
All them playa days is over  
Got me buying Rovers, rings  
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms  
That bomb, that P  
It's a problem call the police  
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast  
Faces of death, she fine or what  
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up  
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's

Girl you're deep inside each day  
Waiting for the courage  
That never came  
  
So on you went without a clue  
That these adoring eyes they long for you  
I tried to get real close to you  
Hoping that you would see through  
My disguise  
And somehow you know that I  
  
Chorus  
  
I adored ya  
Though I never laid my hands on you  
My eyes adored ya  
My eyes adored ya  
Like you couldn't see  
A millions miles away  
How I adored ya  
So close (so close)  
So close and yet so far  
  
You looked at me  
And saw a friend  
You told me things  
And I'd have to pretend  
That you didn't mean  
The world to me  
And all the while  
Behind the scenes  
I cried with you  
And lived your every dream  
Yes I did  
  
The reality  
The hope's still there  
And dreams run wild  
I'll make time to  
So tell me, tell me baby  
Was I a fool  
Do your eyes adore me, too

If I told you you were beautiful  
Would you date me on the regular (Tell me would you)  
Well baby I've been around the world  
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)  
This ring here represents my heart  
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying I do)  
  
[Chorus]  
Because, I can see us holding hands  
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand  
I can see us on the country side  
Sitting in the grass laying side by side  
You can be my baby  
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me  
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy  
See all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love, my love, my love, my love  
  
Now If I wrote you a love note  
And made you smile with every word I wrote (What would you do)  
Would that make you wanna change your scene  
And wanna be the one on my team (Tell me would you)  
See what's the point in waiting anymore  
Cause girl I've never been more sure (That baby it's you)

I don't what she hesitatin' for man  
  
Shorty, cool as a fan on the move once again  
But he still has fam from Peru to Japan  
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan  
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can  
Cause the girls really wild, throw they hands up high  
When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy  
You don't really wanna let the chance go by  
Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly  
Friends so fly I can go fly private, cause I handle mine  
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply cause I am on fire  
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny  
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die  
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?  
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie  
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high  
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy  
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space  
But forget your face, I swear I will  
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill  
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

Lookin' in my eyes  
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life  
And all you had to do was apologize  
You didn't say you're sorry  
  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me again  
Sadness has me at the end of the line  
  
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine  
Loneliness only wants you back here with me  
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me  
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it  
  
But you didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me...  
  
Wish like Hell I could go back in time  
Maybe then I could see how  
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try  
But it's too late  
  
Its over now  
You didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me

Now I can try to act real strong

I still think of you that way  
You should know that  
  
The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights  
They don't mean a thing  
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right  
Without you here with me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
It's hard for me to say  
You were my soul  
  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal  
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel  
I thought that you would never do me that way  
  
But even after all I still think of you that way  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more

Her skin was white so white  
Looked like it had no expiration date  
Black is the color of the night  
And it's time for feeding and her body waits  
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me  
When we raise hell I can't stay away

Hungry for some more

Make me wanna build a coffin for two

But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you

In my bones and my body starts to quake  
Straight up from my toes to my mind  
She controls me but I don't want to escape

Find out that they have made their final mistake

Justin Timberlake,Where Is The Love (with Black Eyed Peas),/j/justin+timberlake/where+is+the+love+with+black+eyed+peas_20625158.html,"[Black Eyed Peas]  
What's wrong with the world, Mama?  
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas.  
I think the whole world is addicted to the drama,  
Only attracted to things that bring the trauma.  
Overseas, yea, we trying to stop terrorism,  
But we still got terrorists here livin'  
In the usa, the big cia, the blood through the cripts of the kkk.  
But if you only have love for your own race,  
Then you only leave space to discriminate,  
And to disciminate only generates hate,  
And when you hate you're bound to get irate.  
Madness is what you demonstrate,  
And that's exacly how Enga works and operates.  
Man, ya gotta have love to set it straight.  
Take control of your mind and meditate.  
Let your soul gravitate to the love, ya'll.  
  
[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]  
People killin', people dyin'.  
Children hurtin', you here them cryin'.  
Can you practice what you preach,  
And would you turn the other cheek?  
Father, Father, Father, help us.  
Send some guidence from above.  
These people got me, got me, questionin'  
Where is the love?  
(where is the love,  
Where is the love,  
Where is the love,  
The love, the love)  
  
[Black Eyed Peas]  
It just ain't the same.  
Always have changed,  
New days are strange.  
Is the world the same?  
If love and peace is so strong,  
Why would pieces of love that don't belong?  
Nation's dropping bombs,  
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones,  
With ongoing suffering as the youth die young.  
So, ask yourself, is the lovin' really caused,  
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong  
In this world that we livin' in.  
People keep on givin' in,  
Makin' wrong decisions,  
Only visions of a different end.  
Now we respectin' each other  
And I've my brother.  
A war's going on,  
But the reason's undercover.  
The truth is kept secret  
And swept under the rug  
If you never know the truth,  
Then you never know love.  
Where's the love ya'll (I don't really know)  
Where's the truth ya'll (I don't really know)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder.  
As I'm gettin older ya'll people gets colder.  
Most of us only care about money-makin.  
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction.  
Wrong information always shown by the media,  
Negative images is the main criteria.  
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria.  
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas.  
  
What ever happened to the values of humanity?  
What ever happened to the fairness and equality?  
Instead of spreading love, we're spreadin' anamosity.  
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity.  
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.  
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down.  
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under.  
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found.

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show  
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow  
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go  
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed  
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose  
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose  
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming

Just wanted to um  
Let how would I put this uhh  
Let's say all your friends  
Remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)

There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

And tell me everything is going to be alright

I'm going to have to improvise

Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise

Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out  
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about  
And they still want to know when the album comin? out  
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters  
Everybody co-signing even non-believers  
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas, made you look, before the haters  
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus  
This is classic  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Kanye West:]  
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness  
It?s performin?, look how long the line is  
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless  
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?  
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened
to my pace  
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I
expected it  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been

[Nas:]  
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this  
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur
night is show time  
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you
could afford it the car ain?t important  
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment  
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty
for doing wrong  
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been

Better than I'v ever been

How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded  
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect  
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop  
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?  
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear
more local MC?s  
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and
rap  
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they
people  
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One

Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part  
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best 'Ye

To our end, though I killed most with a pen

Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years

Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man, our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me  
Now I'm testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask ""Y"" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.  
So I could see you smile

Talking 'bout the soul Kanye, set all his goals Kanye  
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's  
I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called ""I miss the old Kanye""

We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
Right now I can see it so vivid  
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it  
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip  
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits  
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that  
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph  
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh  
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass  
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'  
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'  
What do it mean when you never dream at all then  
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them  
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to  
People you never got a chance to say bye to  
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams  
Into real life, if you try to  
So close, but so far  
And so far, no cigar  
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today  
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow  
No goodbye  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
Uh, to you  
If I part my heart will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
My art will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night

GLC gon' be stoned as Angie  
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me  
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign  
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man  
  
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest  
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi, the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus  
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'  
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'  
  
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep  
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family  
  
It's the Cons fool, word  
  
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prix's  
  
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties  
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is

Niggas took the price on my uncles head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread  
Bow down, brother pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments

Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold  
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul  
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?  
You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford

My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate  
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with  
But still supported me when I did the opposite  
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get  
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you  
You was getting through, can the choir please  
Give me a verse of ""You, Are So Beautiful To Me""  
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry  
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy  
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet

Second they get up you gon get that Benzo  
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out  
To a restaurant, upper echelon  
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want  
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?  
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right

Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo  
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet  
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee  
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid  
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x  
girl I don't wear Prada never met Gucci  
Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi  
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton  
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on  
That's what my old chick used to clash with me  
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)  
Actually you should be happy I purchased that  
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat  
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours  
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter  
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame  
I got a new significant other cause plans change  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes  
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye,"" man that would be so Kanye  
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye

What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
I've been waiting on this my whole life  
These dreams be waking me up at night  
You say I think I'm never wrong  
You know what, maybe you're right, aight  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
You say he get on your fucking nerves  
You hope that he get what he deserves, word  
Do you even remember what the issue is  
You just trying to find where the tissue is  
You can still be who you wish you is  
It ain't happen yet  
And that's what the intuition is  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib  
Run back to their arms  
The smokescreens  
The chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
And I'm back on my grind  
A psychic read my lifeline  
Told me in my lifetime  
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline  
And that's what I'm  
Seven o'clock, that's primetime  
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines  
I'm a star, how could I not shine  
How many ladies in the house  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused  
What you about  
On that independent shit  
Trade it all for a husband and some kids  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Sitting here like why, he at least supersize  
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy

I was the man of the house when there wasn't  
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm  
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum

The aftermath of divorces  
The kids of bitter split ups  
And baby sitters

Short chain wearing  
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing  
Church sock wearing  
When you first stop caring about your appearance  
When you get here anyway I already got parents  
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons  
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance  
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance  
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring  
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud  
But the door was locked and the tv up so loud

And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room""

If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga  
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga  
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga

Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own  
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around

That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then  
Cause when she here he be quiet  
When she leave he be talking again  
He be wylin again  
Be calm I don't drink the drama  
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on  
You gon marry my mom look  
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms  
And I did take little man to church  
And took little man to school

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
  
It's so crazy  
I got everything figured out  
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about  
No doubt  
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is
about  
  
Do you think I sacrificed real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
Do you think I sacrifice a real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
  
There is no Gucci I can buy  
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on  
There is no YSL that they could sell  
To get my heart out of this hell  
And my mind out of this jail  
There is no clothes that I could buy  
That could turn back the time  
There is no vacation spot I could fly  
That could bring back a piece of real life  
Real life, what does it feel like?  
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight  
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight  
To live a real life  
I just want to be a real boy  
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy  
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy  
  
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it  
I tell the truth and I keep runnin  
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something  
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing  
  
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?  
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel  
Do you really have the stamina...  
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'  
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'  
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'  
You oughtta laugh  
I just want to be a real boy,  
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes...  
  
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me  
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more,  
I can't find her no more I cant...  
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...  
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream,  
Chasing everything we seen  
Up on the TV screen  
And when I- the Benz was left  
And the clothes was left  
And the hoes was left  
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-  
You spent the doughs to death  
And tell me what tf for a real boy  
  
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy

Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault

Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts  
Reality is catchin' up with me  
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody  
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me

Run away fast as you can  
  
Twenty four seven, three sixty five,  
Pussy stays on my mind  
I-I-I-I did it,  
All right, all right, I admit it  
Now pick your best move,  
You could leave or live wit' it  
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off  
Split and go where?  
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha  
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off  
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off  
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers  
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas  
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet  
Comes with a price tag, baby face it  
You should leave if you can't accept the basics  
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix  
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless  
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless  
P!  
  
Never was much of a romantic  
I could never take the intimacy  
And I know it did damage  
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me  
I guessin' you're at an advantage  
'Cause you could blame me for everything  
And I don't know where I'ma manage  
If one day you just up and leave  
  
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,  
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,  
Every one of them that I know  
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs  
That'll never take work off

You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary!  
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary

She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family

My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent  
So I guess we should address it huh?  
My swagga is Mcjagga  
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it  
Why he so mad for? Why he gotta have it?  
Cuz I slave my whole life, now I'm the master

How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!  
Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon

Gotta bop like this  
Can't wear skinny jeans  
Cuz my knots don't fit  
No one on the corner  
Gotta pocket like this  
So I rock Roc jeans  
Cuz my knots so thick  
You can learn how to dress  
Just by  
Jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Follow my steps  
It's the road to success  
Where the niggas think you thorough  
And the girls say yes  
But I can't teach you my swag  
You can pay for school  
But you can't buy class  
School of hard knocks  
I'm a grad  
All blue Yankee

Dipping different rovas [?]  
Wipping with the soda [?]

No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch!  
But I'm too clean for these boys  
I require what I desire  
I got stripes Adidas  
Mami scream papi no mas  
Run up in yo shit just me no moss  
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs  
No one has swagger like these 4 guys  
When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking about?  
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about!  
And I'm gone.. Bye  
  
[T. I.]  
You go see weezy for the wordplay,  
Jeezy for the bird play,  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose,  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,  
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is
what another rapper do,  
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities,  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,  
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at,  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,  
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,  
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag!

While the dove domains  
And feel the juice run as she flies  
Run my winds under her sighs  
As the flames of eternity rise  
To lick us with the first-born lash of dawn  
Oh really my dear  
I can't see what we fear  
Sat here with ourselves in between us  
And at the door we can't say more  
Than just another day  
And without a sound I turn around  
And I walk away

In ruins, sunken below the waves

No fight left or so it seems

I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no-one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have friends  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good

Never thought that I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home

And whatever may go

Moved on to another town  
Tried hard to settle down  
For every job, so many men  
So many men no-one needs

Tripping on the water like a laughing girl.  
Time in her eyes is spawning past life,  
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled,  
Holding all the love that waits for you here.  
Catch us now for I am your future.  
  
A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land.  
Come over here to where When lingers,  
Waiting in this empty world,  
Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools.  
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave,  
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools.  
  
We are of the going water and the gone.  
We are of water in the holy land of water  
And all that's to come runs in  
With the thrust on the strand.""

Cold mountain water. Don't ever swim there.  
Just stand on the edge and look in there.  
And you might see a woman down there.  
  
They say some days, up she comes, up she rises, as if out of nowhere.  
Wearing Victorian dress.  
She was calling her pet, ""Snowflake! Snowflake!""  
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake.  
  
Just like a poor, porcelain doll...  
Her eyes are open but no-one's home.  
The clock has stopped.  
So long she's gone.  
  
No-one's home.  
Her old dog is sleeping.  
His legs are frail now.  
But when he dreams,  
  
He runs...  
Along long beaches and sticky fields.  
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her.  
The beds are made. The table is laid.  
  
The door is open - someone is calling: It's a woman.  
""Here boy, here boy! You've come home!  
I've got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love.  
Miss me? Did you miss me?

Lead right up to the sea  
No one, no one is here  
No one, no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
We tire of the city  
We tire of it all  
We long for just that something more

The stars are caught in our hair  
The stars are on our fingers  
A veil of diamond dust  
Just reach up and touch it  
The sky's above our heads  
The sea's around our legs  
In milky, silky water  
We swim further and further  
We dive down  
We dive down  
  
A diamond night, a diamond sea  
And a diamond sky  
  
We dive deeper and deeper  
We dive deeper and deeper

Rising and rising

Holding hands, they found the broom-cupboard  
Where he had control as far as the fall  
When his hand covered wet hair  
She took over among furniture wax  
Dust, and the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth  
When he was sick, she comforted him

And cuddle to the wind  
Sleep on through the waves

Had left out those details of delight.  
Satisfied, he would collapse out,  
Puzzled at why she still squirmed,  
Held onto him, tears curling into her mouth  
This was something their stories always omitted  
That her joy would seem like pain  
When he focused after his release.  
  
Do sand and shells and stones  
Peep in through your night?  
But you should not be hurt  
For all will pass with time.

Would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf  
Would give it tenderly into his hand  
Full of dead things before they reached the car  
  
When they drove she sat with mouth open  
As though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch  
Her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg  
  
Hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart  
He feared her, and slapped out sideways into her face  
She entered the cut with her tongue  
Gurgling gratitude for the strange taste  
  
Do you fear the dark?  
Then hush, and realise  
That though the angels never come  
Prayers can soothe your mind

Their corpses giving the vehicle arms  
Petrol and blood at last dripping together  
But quick flashes of a planned lunch  
Cold red beef, white cloth by a cherrywood fire  
Game pie, and for him two pints of colder beer  
The winter air tucking under their eyelids  
As they spun on the gravel at Clandon  
Their hands steaming from quick moisture  
The aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril  
Dazed after mutual masturbation  
They zigzagged into a conservative end  
  
Oh hush, my friend, asleep

Take a look at those clowns  
And the tricks that they play  
In the circus of life  
Life is bitter and gay  
  
There are clowns in the night  
Clowns everywhere  
See how they run  
Run from despair  
You can be thrilled  
And you can be free  
  
""How?""  
  
But only my friend  
If you'll listen to me  
  
When the fantasy bells  
Of the universe ring  
You can fly through the sky  
On a dragonfly's wing  
There is magic within  
There is magic without  
Follow me and you'll learn  
Just what life's all about  
Just what life's all about

Crossing over lines where I always used to stop  
Living outside of the box  
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not

When I got off my back, found some motivation  
I've been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive  
  
I was living on a fault line, the fault was all mine  
And this unstable ground found me down half the time  
But I had enough, I had to get up  
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff  
  
Then it hit me, you won't permit me  
To be an individual just doesn't fit me

And ambiguality is a new priority  
All it takes, for heaven sakes  
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

Taking my time when I always used to rush  
Living outside of the box

When I broke down the walls for my liberation

Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet  
  
Always on the brink of a heart attack  
You keep me alive and keep me coming back

You gotta future full of blue skies

An unexpected gift  
Said I was pretty, and I believed it  
Not really used to all this attention  
Told myself I don't deserve you  
And this is just a phase  
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?  
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say

What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?  
Doctors say I'm the illest, cause I'm suffering from realness  
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone  
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone  
These other niggas is lyin, actin' like the summer ain't mine

Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone  
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone

""One day my prince will come""  
So I wait for that date

Find my better half  
So we make perfect shapes  
If stars don't align,  
If it doesn't stop time,  
If you cant see the sign,  
Wait for it  
One hundred percent,  
With every penny spent

Finishes your sentences

And your, your looking for me  
It's a crazy idea that you were made,  
Perfectly for me you'll see

Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending

Magazines  
We would  
Change the chanel  
On the tv screen

What ya did to me  
Straight to hell it's what they sell

It's amazin' to hear people singin' along  
Hear the radio playin' my song  
I still get butterflies  
Still get nervous inside  
In the spotlight  
  
Now every now n then  
On a friday night  
Cruisin' down to the dive bar  
We waste the night away  
Spend saturday sleepin' in late

We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead  
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos  
  
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof  
Talk about our future like we had a clue  
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
In another life, I would be your girl  
We keep all our promises, be us against the world  
In another life, I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away  
The one that got away  
  
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash  
Never one without the other, we made a pact  
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa  
  
Someone said you had your tattoo removed  
Saw you downtown, singing the blues  
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

The one, the one, the one  
The one that got away

Can't replace you with a million rings, no

What a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful

And there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on  
The end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his  
Nose. Dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling  
Your ring? Said the piggy I will.  
So they took it away and were married nest day by the  
Turkey who lived on the hill.

If Id was waiting, like I promised long before.  
Your shadow filled the room, the music changed its tune,  
When I saw you, you were standing at the door.  
  
Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight.  
A blazing sun, you were shining in the night,  
When I really should have known, that youd be coming home.  
I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see,  
  
If you were coming, why was there such a long delay.  
At times I thought you lied, or else you would have tried,  
To let me know that you were coming home today.  
Like summer snow, it falls around me in the cold.  
  
I can hear the echoes, of the warnings I was told.  
That I should know, that youd be coming home.

Keith Green,The Prodigal Son Suite,/k/keith+green/the+prodigal+son+suite_20077391.html,"I was done hoeing, out in the fields for the day,  
I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,  
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,  
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.  
  
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,  
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,  
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.  
  
I said, father, there's so much to know,  
There's a world of things to see,  
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine,  
I will go, if I can have your blessing,  
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.  
Son, I've always tried my best for you,  
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of God.  
  
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,  
I met a travelling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,  
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,  
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,  
He said, no, it isn't that bad.  
And then a few days later, on an old city road,  
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,  
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,  
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land,  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was so hard to find,  
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,  
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.  
I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,  
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,  
I had to eat with the swine,  
The bread I ate was like stone,  
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.  
Oh, the servants there are better fed,  
If I could only have what my father gives them,  
I would truly need nothing more.  
Oh, I will go and say to him,  
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,  
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them.  
  
It didn't take too long to pack my things,  
I left with only what I wore,  
As I prayed that I still had a home.  
I was near home, in site of the house,  
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,  
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,  
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,  
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,  
I've learned that my home is right where you are,  
Oh father, take me in.  
Bring the best robe, put it on my son,  
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,  
This is my son who I thought had died,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,  
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,  
My son was dead and he's now alive,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
My son was dead,  
My son was lost,  
My son's returned in the hands of God.

Oh yeah yeah  
  
I'm changing lanes and talkin' on the phone  
Drivin' way too fast.  
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me  
Afraid of comin' in last.  
But somewhere in the race we run,  
We're coming undone

And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
'Cause days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
Out on the roof just the other night  
I watched the world flash by,  
Headlights, taillights,  
Running through a river of neon signs.  
But somewhere in the rush I felt,  
We're losing ourselves  
  
And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
Days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
Yeah the days go by  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
We think about tomorrow then it slips away.  
Oh, yes, it does.  
We talk about forever but we've only got today  
  
And the days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by

So take 'em by the hand,  
They're yours and mine.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
And live your life.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
Don't let 'em all fly by!

Will spare us both the pain

Was the hardest thing to do  
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy  
Who can't afford a girl like you

From his greasy fingerprints

What was handed down to him

Just like there's a ghost in this guitar  
A ghost in this guitar  
  
Well, the night before he died he made me take it  
He said, ""You play it now, 'cause I gotta go""  
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it

And sometimes I just sit back

But it's still not enough for how I feel about you  
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive

Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me  
You'd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song, oh oh oh  
  
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes  
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight  
It'd be so easy I'll just write it from my heart  
'Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me  
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be  
Stuck in my head all day  
'Cause you're already there anyway, yes you are

It'll harden our hearts  
And love could use a day of rest  
Before we both start falling apart

Storming like crazy  
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon

Can take care of itself  
'Cause we've got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
  
Your love is like religion  
A cross in Mexico  
And your kiss is like the innocence  
Of a prayer nailed to a door  
  
Oh surrender is much sweeter  
When we both let it go  
Let the water wash our bodies clean  
And love wash our souls  
  
And pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon

To the rhythm in my soul

When I look in the mirror  
He's right there in my eyes  
Starin' back at me and I realize

The more I can see  
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
There were times I thought he was bein'  
Just a little bit hard on me  
But now I understand he was makin' me  
Become the man he knew that I could be  
In everything he ever did  
He always did with love  
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son  
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad  
I just smile and say you already have

My heart, my soul  
My hands, my pride

Everything's gonna be alright""

And how without a single warning  
It all slipped away from me  
  
And like a fool I thought that I could fight  
The shadows on my own  
To the dark I was no stranger  
But this was stronger than I'd known  
  
And by the time I knew that I was in too deep  
I'd gone too far  
And the light that used to guide me  
Had faded from my heart  
  
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go  
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home  
And I don't know how you found me  
All I know is I owe you everything to you  
Yes I do

There was something so familar  
About the way you said my name  
  
And the whole world started turning  
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new  
And it's all because of you

And I will take you down the river  
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree  
I'll take you down to the river  
Where you and I can just be you and me  
  
I see us know just lyin' underneath the heavens  
Sippin' on wine with nothing much to do  
Just you in my arms when the sun is settin'  
Then makin' sweet love in the night of Mr Moon

You know I""ll love you anyway  
All I will feel the same until the sun don't shine  
All I want to do is stay  
Cause you're a once in every lifetime oh

I don't know why it always ends this way  
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides  
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight  
  
But I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you promised you'd be back again  
And so I wander 'round this town  
'Til summer comes around  
  
I got a job working at the old park pier  
And every summer now for five long years  
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks  
And I count the days til you just might come back  
  
And then I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you swore you'd be back again  
And so I'm frozen in this town  
'Til summer comes around  
And it comes around  
  
And I close my eyes and you and I  
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel rocking with the motions  
And Hand in hand we cried and laughed  
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment  
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear  
But now the winter wind is the only sound  
And everything is closing down  
'Til summer comes around

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show  
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control  
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain  
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain  
From my eyes  
Tonight I want to cry  
  
Would it help if I turned a sad song on  
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone  
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters  
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better

Every Friday night when the sun went down

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go  
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do  
Seven kids on a two lane road  
Had the guns on the radio  
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine  
Sipping on the local's spark of light  
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
  
Out of nowhere, it slipped away  
And the rope by the river hangs silently  
And the town that we knew ain't nothing like it used to be  
Ah, I can't explain  
They took all the color from the picture frame  
And the days got sold to the grid and the game  
  
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go

Swinging on the line  
Living all that wasted time  
  
Hey, hey, now  
Summer dresses drying out on the hood of the car  
Only music that we had was out the left speaker  
We were living every second 'til the time ran out  
We had nothing but we had it all  
  
When I think about those summer night  
Sneaking out the window, running back roads  
Your hand in mine  
We were going nowhere, we were so alive  
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Backseat promise  
Breaking it

But I think that's a lie  
'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side

Tonight I feel a little bit brave

The last time you kissed me  
You kept both eyes open  
Baby, can you tell me what does that mean?  
If you're looking all over your shoulder  
Then you don't need to be with me  
And I don't need to hold on

Just don't pretend that you're into me  
If it ain't true no, don't let me stop you

Got a high threshold for pain  
But let's get one thing straight, I'm not down to share you with anyone  
If that's not what you're looking for  
Nice knowing you, but there's the door  
'Cause I know that I can find someone who'll give me what I want

Sorry doesn't cut it babe  
Take the hit and walk away  
'Cause I'm gone  
  
Doesn't matter what you do  
It's what you did that's hurting you  
All I needed was the truth  
Now I'm gone  
  
What you see's not what you get  
What you see's not what you get  
You know you did it  
  
I'm gone  
To find someone to live for in this world  
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight  
Just a bridge that I gotta burn  
You are wrong  
If you think you can walk right through my door  
That is just so you

But you and I went and built it anyway  
And it only took a second to watch it all fall to dust  
I thought you hung up the moon  
And you thought I lit up the room  
But the lights turned off and it was the end of us

It just didn't go off right away  
But man did it go off when it finally did  
Everything's suddenly magnified  
It's loud and it's quiet at the same time  
As the echo of it's all over sets in

You held my hand, you held me tight

Shocked, broken

Mistaken, your sadness  
Was hiding inside

The soul behind a guise

Wishing I was more than what my story is told

Longing for a hand to hold  
Keep clear of the shadows

Fell on your head, but you're queen of cliches

Yeah my heart is wet and heavy but my body's on the run  
Cause the night is gonna get me and it's only just begun  
I keep livin' on the memory of you and me, you, me in the Sun

And I'm tryna count my blessings 'stead of all the tears I've cried  
I keep driving in this darkness to get you, to get you off my mind  
I'll start over in a new place, put my feet back on the ground  
Can't believe the mess that I've made, just tryna drown you out  
Baby one day I won't miss you, I'll stop looking for you in the crowd

Footsteps down the hall  
Warm breath, back of my neck  
Shadows on the wall  
And your voice is loud as thunder  
I can hear it crashing in my head

Kelly Clarkson,It's Quiet Uptown,/k/kelly+clarkson/its+quiet+uptown_21112152.html,"[Verse 1]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There is suffering too terrible to name  
You hold your child as tight as you can  
Then push away the unimaginable  
The moments when you're in so deep  
Feels easier to just swim down  
And so they move uptown  
And learn to live with the unimaginable  
  
I spend hours in the garden  
I walk alone to the store  
And it's quiet uptown  
I never liked the quiet before  
I take the children to church on Sunday  
A sign of the cross at the door  
And I pray  
That never used to happen before  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street walking by himself  
Talking to himself, have pity  
You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown  
He is working through the unimaginable  
His hair has gone grey, he passes every day  
They say he walks the length of the city  
You knock me out, I fall apart  
Can you imagine?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Look at where we are  
Look at where we started  
I know I don't deserve you  
But hear me out, that would be enough  
If I could spare his life  
If I could trade his life for mine  
He'd be standing here right now  
And you would smile  
And that would be enough  
I don't pretend to know  
The challenges we're facing  
I know there's no replacing what we've lost  
And you need time  
But I'm not afraid  
I know who I married  
Just let me stay here by your side  
And that would be enough  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown  
He is trying to do the unimaginable  
If you see him walking in the park, long after dark  
Taking in the sights of the city  
Look around, look around, look around  
They are trying to do the unimaginable  
  
[Verse 3]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There's a grace too powerful to name  
We push away what we could never understand  
We push away the unimaginable  
They are standing in the garden  
Standing there side by side  
She takes his hand  
It's quiet uptown  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Look around, look around  
They are going through the unimaginable

Kelly Clarkson,My Grown Up Christmas List,/k/kelly+clarkson/my+grown+up+christmas+list_10156563.html,"Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up Christmas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
As children we believe  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree  
But Heaven only knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a heartached human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown up Christmas list

A different north in the ever end

O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rockets' red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof thro' the night

Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you it's only seed  
  
It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give  
And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the spring  
Becomes The Rose

Living for the day I could make it all up to you

Walking every street knocking on every door

Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond  
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress  
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest

I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud  
  
And it was down with the old man, up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
  
Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound  
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground  
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone  
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home  
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay  
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed  
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Raised to walk in the way of light and truth

Laugh as your stories ramble on  
Break my heart but it won't bleed

Always sure until I doubt  
Walk a line until it blurs  
Build the walls too high to climb out

Left holding a losing hand  
One day you're gonna find someone  
Right away, you'll know it's true

Was just a part of the passing through  
Right there in that moment

So get it while you can cause looks don't last  
There's money in those pockets for the taking  
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast  
  
The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water  
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall  
The business men stare at the single mother  
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll have a house out in the country  
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn  
And no one will ever know what it was she did before  
But she just heard the DJ say ""you're on""  
And the lights come up and they play her song  
  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, smiling while she dances  
Is the price she has to pay  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
It's the price she has to pay

Sometimes a pair of high heal shoes  
Some come rolled in paper  
Some have six strings and only play the blues  
Once you meet the devil  
There's no way he'll let you be  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
Skeletons in closets  
Ghost underneath the bed  
They hide out in pictures  
And in words better left unsaid  
They hang around like perfume  
And haunt me like an ancient melody  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's things I can?t leave alone  
'Cause they won't leave me alone  
What I want ain't what I need  
Still I reach for the things I crave  
Better try to runaway  
Maybe I'm afraid of being free  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
So roll one up and light it  
Pickup my old guitar  
I'm playing crossroads  
Drinkin' whiskey from the mason jar  
There's heartache at my front door  
Says she needs my company  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me

Saw a old man being interviewed  
Turning a hundred and two today  
Asked him what's the secret to life  
He looked up from his old pipe  
Laughed and said ""All I can say is""  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't blink  
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you  
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your
wife  
Don't blink  
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did  
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""  
Of fifty years is there in bed  
And you're praying God takes you instead  
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think  
So don't blink  
  
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said  
""Best start putting first things first""  
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand  
You can't flip it over and start again  
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

So I've been tryin' to slow it down  
I've been tryin' to take it in  
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

13 in the thick of a cornfield  
I learned to fight, kick, roast, tied a knot shoe  
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train  
My first chance I got out of Smallville  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
My first stop was a pawn shop  
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it  
I had a quick right hand, and an old band  
I thought good friends would make a good band  
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So there I was, a long way from nowhere  
Frightened mind, spare time and a blank stare  
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang  
After all we didn't share a set of rings  
Besides, how bad could it be!  
She never found out I'd never come clean  
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?  
On-Time ballroom  
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch  
Nobody follows  
Everybody's got their own past  
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

In this whole world that can make me smile

Down the road  
  
Somewhere inside of me  
There was something she took a liking to  
I asked her to marry me  
She said she really wanted to  
  
Down the road  
To see what life's gonna hold  
Down the road

If I make enough to take his daughter

Before he could let her go  
Down the road

There's an engineer with an only son  
And our baby girl says  
She believes that he is the only one

Still this feels like home  
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound  
With a cooler and a bong  
  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Tonight I don't need to feel famous  
Out here all I feel is free  
  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth

Kenny Chesney,"From Hillbilly Heaven, To Honky Tonk Hell",/k/kenny+chesney/from+hillbilly+heaven+to+honky+tonk+hell_20077653.html,"On a hillside in Hazzard  
Sets a new double-wide  
God's little acre  
Your paradise  
  
A poor boy found heaven  
With a good country girl  
He had all he wanted  
She was his whole world  
  
But working the coal mine  
Can wear a man down  
He started spending  
Too much time in town  
  
He found temptation  
Fell under it's spell  
And hillbilly Heaven  
Went to honky tonk Hell  
  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
Somewhere in Hazzard  
On a dark, dead-end street  
Where whiskey and heartache  
And old memories meet  
  
He looks for salvation  
In a bottle each night  
And just goes on livin'  
Though he's lost his life  
  
Now there's a job in the coal mine  
That needs to be filled  
And a heartache in Hazzard  
That won't ever heal  
  
He had it all  
Now it's all for sale  
And hillbilly Heaven's  
Gone to honky tonk Hell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven

First one drink, then two then I woke up with you

But it's still a little hazy

'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy  
Drivin' my first love out to the levy  
Livin' life with no sense of time  
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin' Me Baby""  
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies  
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor  
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore  
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends  
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  
Takes us to another place and time  
  
So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir  
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church  
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
To the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
I go back (I go back)  
To watchin' summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
I go back (I go back)  
To the loss of a real good friend

So with a hopeful heart, I hit one knee  
With a tear in her eye, she looked at me  
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death.  
My life hung on what that tear meant,  
Then she smiled at me,  
And I lost it.

No one can make me cry,  
Make me laugh,  
Make me smile,

Better or worse,  
One things for sure,  
It's real love,  
And I don't know what I'd do,  
If I lost it.

Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends,  
And the apartment got smaller every day.  
Then one night, the walls finally closed in,  
I came home late, she said ""Where have you been?  
You used to call and tell me, ""you're on your way.""  
She said, ""If this is how this is gonna be, then I quit.""

And I hope it never ends  
Been down so many highways,  
Full of twists and turns and bends

Here's to faces I have seen  
A carnival of those who dream  
Rodeos seekin' fame  
Table dancers I can't name  
Willie T. in Abilene  
Karaoke's all-time king  
And every six string wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes  
To another one-night show  
'Cause that's where I was born to be  
Have guitar, will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin' this lifetime lottery  
  
To every dreamer I have known  
May Lady Luck take you home  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free ... like me  
  
Livin' free like me

Kenny Chesney,Live A Little,/k/kenny+chesney/live+a+little_20904843.html,"Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate  
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans  
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent  
Not a minute left for me to be me  
  
Been going like nothing can wait  
I gotta get my priorities straight  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do  
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath  
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found  
Maybe Miss Wonderful, I haven't met yet  
  
It just hit me like a wrecking ball  
She's giving me a wake up call  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Step back, smell the rose  
Feel the sand between your toes  
Unplug, unwind  
Step out in the sunshine  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Take the girl, get a map and pick any ol' dot

About the tour he did and the deal he got.

If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...

Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue.  
I'd be knee-deep in sand on  
A Panama Beach In the spring of '72.  
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay,  
Watchin' the tide roll in.

Live those songs again.""

Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher  
Yeah life was good everywhere  
We went out last night  
  
Well you know I'm a music man  
I grew up in East Tennessee  
But last night I was everything  
When I got a few drinks in me  
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son  
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run  
Anything I thought would get the job done  
  
Yeah we went out last night  
One thing started leadin' to another  
Out last night  
Hittin' on everybody and their mother  
There were people doin' body shots up on the bar  
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car  
Everybody was some kind of star  
When we went out last night  
  
Well the fact that I'm still breathing  
Means that I must have survived  
And that I'll live to go out with  
My friends again tonight  
  
Oh we went out last night  
One thing started leadin' to another  
Out last night  
Everybody started lovin' on each other  
They were dancin' on the tables, howlin' at the moon  
Pairing off together and pretty soon  
There was not a soul in sight  
When we went out last night

The tears ain't gonna hit the floor

I knew I'd be missing  
The feel of the wind on my face  
I was stuck in a habit  
  
Wondering what happened  
Two days of taking all the blame  
Got a drink, or two,  
That's as fool proof as what it will be  
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl  
Kind of making eyes at me  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah, the music's too good,  
My friends are all out  
And they're all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
I've got nothing to say  
I'll save it for a rainy day  
  
They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's  
And how'd I let you get away  
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head  
Is just gonna have to wait

The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you

Been a fools disciple miss dance recitals

A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
When you get down on your knees tonight  
To thank the Lord for his guiding light  
And pray they turn out right

Can't you see I'm cryin  
Tears are in my eyes  
Send down a cloud with a silver lining  
Take me to paradise  
  
Show me that river  
Lead me across  
And take all my troubles away

Get ready for the big revival  
  
Get ready for the big revival  
Everybody get in the van  
There's a little church on Eagle Mountain  
It's called The Blood of the Blessed Land  
If your faith ain't strong enough, child, you might wind up dead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
Now Reverend Jones, he struts and dances  
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace  
He testifies in tongues of fire  
With tears of joy running down his face  
He ain't sure and we ain't sure exactly what he said  
But praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead

You won't find many hypocrites that'll take the chance on getting bit  
(The big revival, the big revival, the big revival, the big revival)  
But a true believer can survive rattlesnakes and cyanide  
  
Now when you hold that deadly viper  
Keep the holy spirit in your mind  
Do not lose your concentration  
That serpent's surely bound to strike  
Either way you won't forget the first time that you said  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead

I'm back in my helmet, cleats, and shoulder pads  
Standing in the huddle, listening to the call  
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall  
  
They didn't let just anybody in that club  
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood  
To get to wear those game-day jerseys down the hall  
The kings of the school, man, we're the boys of fall

It's fighting back them butterflies  
It's call it in the air, alright  
Yes sir, we want the ball  
And it's knocking heads and talking trash  
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass  
It's I got your number, I got your back  
When your back's against the wall  
You mess with one man, you got us all

In little towns like mine, that's all they've got  
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops

Young girls will dream about the boys of fall

So I drove around till I saw the neon light  
The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up.  
Not a soul around but the old bar keep  
Down at the end lookin' half asleep  
But he walked up and said, what'll it be?  
I said the good stuff.  
He didn't reach around for the whiskey.  
He didn't pour me a beer.  
His blue eyes kinda went misty.  
He said you can't find that here.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date.  
Momma's all worried when you get home late  
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate  
'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much  
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair.  
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year  
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up  
Yeah man, that's the good stuff.  
  
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass.  
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that.  
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends.  
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare.  
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair  
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.  
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me.  
But I've been sober three years now  
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey  
  
Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl  
The way she adored that string of pearls  
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl  
Married his high school love.  
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.  
Bein' right there as our time got small  
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up  
Yeah man that's the good stuff.  
  
He said, when you get home she'll start to cry.  
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I.  
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  
'Cause that's the good stuff.  
  
That's the good stuff.

Kenny Chesney,The Life,/k/kenny+chesney/the+life_20772061.html,"It was early one morning  
Playa del Carmen  
That's when I first met Jose  
He had a 12 foot Schooner  
A 3 foot cooler  
Full of the catch of the day  
And he was wrinkled from grinning  
From all of the sun he had been in  
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand  
He said ""Gracias senor"", when I paid him too much for  
All of the Snapper he had  
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing  
In the best broken Spanish I knew  
I said I make a good living  
Back home where I'm from  
He smiled and said Amigo me too  
  
He said I fish and I play my guitar  
I laugh at the bar with my friends  
I go home to my wife  
I pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Somewhere over Texas  
I thought of my Lexus  
And all the stuff I work so hard for  
And all the things that I've gathered  
From climbing that ladder  
Didn't make much sense anymore  
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet  
They keep holding my feet to the fire  
They call it paying the price  
So that one day in life  
I'll have what I need to retire  
  
And just fish  
And play my guitar  
And laugh at the bar with my friends  
And go home to my wife  
And pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made  
When the truth is I'm really just dying  
To live like Jose  
  
And just fish  
Play my guitar  
Laugh at the bar with my friends  
Go home to my wife  
Pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Wouldn't that be the life?  
Wouldn't that be the life?

Counting down the memories and adding up the miles  
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while  
  
Clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
  
Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed  
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette  
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme  
Threw up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign

What my life would be like if I were back to being free  
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer
to  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
  
You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had
all he could  
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye  
  
When I think about leaving I think about him  
That little apartment cross town he's living in  
Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other
weekend  
When I think about leaving oh I think about him  
  
I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he
walked out on her  
And her mom when she was just a kid  
  
When I think about leaving oh I think about her  
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt  
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are
you coming  
Back  
When I think about leaving I think about her  
  
You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we
got something  
Special  
When I think about leaving I think about us  
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender
way we touch,  
All those nights we spent making love,  
When I think about leaving oh I think about us  
  
When I think about leaving I think again  
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then  
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would
rather be  
When I think about leaving I think again  
  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving: I think again

Cold drink chillin' in my right hand,  
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light,  
Restin' up for a long long night.  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',  
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,  
When the sun sinks down, over the water,  
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.  
  
All day long, just taking it easy,  
Laying in a hammock, where it's nice and breezy,  
Been sleepin' off the night before, 'cause when the sun goes down,  
We'll be back for more.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
This old guitar,and my dark sunglasses,  
This sweet concoction is as smooth as molasses,  
Nothing to do, but breath all day,  
Until the big moon rises and its time to play.  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]  
  
When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',  
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright,  
When the sun sinks down, over the water,  
She thinks crackers sexy when the sun goes down.

Kenny Chesney,Where I Grew Up,/k/kenny+chesney/where+i+grew+up_20904721.html,"There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house  
Where Mama used to measure us  
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised  
But that ain't where I grew up  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
The summer my Granddaddy died  
The first time I saw Mama cry  
Man, that sure was tough  
  
Felt like I put on a few years  
Watching Daddy wipe her tears  
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud  
That's where I grew up  
  
My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank  
Getting a head start on twenty one  
That's the place that made me feel just like a man  
But that ain't where I grew up, no  
  
See I gained a little on Father Time  
That night I crossed that center line  
I bet I rolled a dozen times  
  
Next thing I knew I was waking up upside down  
Praying ""God, just get me out""  
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck  
Hey, that's where I grew up  
  
You learn as you go, that's how you grow  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
When me and her, had our first big fight  
I said some things, I made her cry  
She packed all her stuff  
  
The boy in me said let her go  
But the man in me said pull her close  
It was time to find out which one I was  
Standing in a doorway holding on to love  
  
That's where I grew up  
Oh, that's where I grew up

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew  
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin' started clashin'...  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'

I hear you laughing in the rain

All the hell that I've been through  
Just knowing no one could take your place  
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today  
  
Would you see the world, would you chase your dreams  
Settle down with a family  
I wonder what would you name your babies  
Some days the sky's so blue  
I feel like I can talk to you  
I know it might sound crazy

Together, believed that we could live there forever  
Then it faded away  
Forgetting, we wandered too far from the land we'd known  
  
Of all the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
Avalon  
  
They had it, it wasn't far away or imagined  
He held her in his arms and planned it all  
The towers of Avalon  
They warned him, he only turned around for a moment  
And everything had changed  
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away  
  
All the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you come to know the miracle, it's mystical  
When someone else's heart is in your hand  
I learned too late, now I must try and find a way back home, ohh  
  
Here is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back  
(Avalon)  
Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way  
(Avalon)  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back

Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way

Kenny Loggins,Give It Half A Chance,/k/kenny+loggins/give+it+half+a+chance_20210854.html,"I wake up  
In the middle of a dream  
To an unfamiliar scene  
Wonder what I fell into  
Who knows why  
People look for alibis  
In a passing stranger's eyes  
What am I supposed to do  
So tonight  
Tell her that you love her tonight  
The only way to know is to try  
tonight  
Give it half a chance  
And the glow  
From the bathroom down the hall  
Lights a mirror on a wall  
Where a stranger stares at me.  
""Hello, stranger,  
Where you been?  
Do you still remember when?  
Well, every heartache has an end  
'N maybe yours is on the way""  
One by one  
Let the nights go on  
And you won't need yesterday  
Beside you  
See yourself in love again  
And believe in the arms you're in  
Tonight.

Trembling hands unfold a photograph.

Smiles from a distant sunrise,  
The only smile you've seen in days.

Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
Come back to me  
Or I will fade away  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
I still believe in you  
My runaway.  
  
Jesse and Willy Lee  
Play in the street while their mother wonders,  
""Why won't they listen to a word I say?""  
I sing a lullaby  
To the baby in my arms  
And the laughter fades away.

Come back my darlin'

For the runaway

Cuts through the night  
Like a lighthouse callin'  
All of the lost and forgotten.  
I made a vow I will continue  
'Til I find you.

His heart had been bought and bound  
But he chanced to fall in new love  
He kissed her and he cut the tie  
And kissed his lucky lady goodbye  
  
Oh, spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like you've been with me in life  
If I leave you for a lover  
Would you leave me far behind  
  
You should've known from the start  
She'd take no part in a love triangle  
You have to be her's alone  
And go it on your own  
Because if you've found a new love  
Lady Luck is gonna step aside  
So kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
  
Spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like you've been with me in life?  
If I leave you for an hour  
Would you leave me far behind?  
  
Seven-eleven he rolled  
And all his life was a golden gamble  
You'd see him reeling it in when the odds were high  
Something supernatural, a charlatan, was a mastermind  
Or some lucky lady's  
Or some jealous lady  
Kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
Don't pass this way again, goodbye  
Don't pass this way again, goodbye

Let the old guard surrender  
It is a new day, a new world,  
A new language I wish to speak  
The language of love  
May I have the words I need to speak my truth,  
To translate my heart and my vision  
To my beloved and his children  
To all who come to sit at our table  
Or walk with us through the market place  
Or pray with us by the water  
  
May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel  
Or why there is pain,  
If the answers are mine to know.  
And if they are, I ask the Spirit to let me share them  
With a light heart, with laughter,  
Wth no expectation, with humility  
But for the grace of Thee, go I.  
May I know my innocence  
Every moment of every day  
May I be a child forever  
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love  
By my own communication to the Spirit.  
May my aliveness always be as loud  
When I make love, as when I cry  
May I see my own reflection in the mirror  
And smile  
  
My love,  
You are my teacher  
And I surrender to your heart  
The purest heart I've ever seen  
Today I give you everything that is mine to give  
My truth  
All my innocence  
and all my heart  
I am yours  
Let the dance begin.

So easily you love to leave

You've opened up a hundred eyes  
And given them a point of view  
Now think about the times you knew  
And hold them up to me and you

You close your eyes and  
Fantasize a lost horizon  
A memory, a gentle breeze for love  
To ride in,  
But in your dreams you turned arouind  
And stumbled on a Shangri-la,  
You'll never be along anymore,  
'Cause brother now you've gone too far  
Love has come of age

I'll stop by by tonight  
I'll stop by by morning. Momma

You'll have to hold on tight
