Randy Travis,From Your Knees,/r/randy+travis/from+your+knees_20748930.html,"He tore down the work of 17 years brick by brick  
And stone by stone  
No hammer was swingin' cause cheatin' and drinkin'  
Don't need no help wreckin' a home  
Ah, but when he came back through the dust and the rubble  
Of what he had once called his life  
He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief of the total destruction inside  
  
There were empty closets and empty drawers  
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor  
And burning memories in the fireplace  
He waited too late to say he was wrong  
His house was still standing but his home was gone  
Brother, you would not believe  
What you can see from your knees  
  
Right then and there in an old sinner's prayer  
He told things he'd kept in the dark  
There was no use in lying cause the man who was listening  
Could see every room in his heart  
Ah, he took empty whisky bottles, little black book and all  
To the fire she left on the grate  
Ah, sometimes a man will change on his own  
But sometimes I tell you it takes  
  
Empty closets and empty drawers  
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor  
And burning memories in the fireplace  
He waited to late to say he was wrong  
His house was still standing he'd fight for his home  
Brother, you would not believe, oh you would not believe  
What you can see from your knees

Randy Travis,Good Intentions,/r/randy+travis/good+intentions_20114210.html,"Mama always prayed that I'd be a better man than daddy  
And I determined not to let her down  
Deserted by the man she loved and left to raise four children  
We were the local gossip of the town.  
  
I promised her that I'd live right and not be like the others  
But I wound up in jail on Christmas day  
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers  
When I got home my mom had passed away  
  
(chorus)  
And I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions  
And mama my intentions were the best  
There's lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention  
Looks like I've turned out like all the rest  
But mama my intentions were the best  
  
A little boy with big blue eyes a-beggin' to go fishing  
I promised him but never took the time  
Now they won't let me see him and I sit here a-wishing  
Wishin' I could hold him one more time  
  
(repeat chorus)  
But mama my intentions were the best

Randy Travis,High Lonesome,/r/randy+travis/high+lonesome_20212458.html,"High in a tree on the top of the hill  
By the light of the lonesome ol? moon  
I hear the call of a lone whippoorwill  
Singing his mournful tune  
Way off in the night blows the long freight train  
With a roar and a ramble of wheels  
My poor heart is breaking with every refrain  
'Cause it sounds just like the way I feel  
And it's high lonesome  
High lonesome heartbroken and blue  
High lonesome  
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you  
Do you ever get weary roamin' around?  
Do you think of the sweet love we knew?  
Do you ever get lonesome the way I am now?  
Lil? darling I'm lonesome for you  
And it's high lonesome

Randy Travis,Horse Called Music,/r/randy+travis/horse+called+music_20218129.html,"High on a mountain in western Montana  
A silhouette moves across a cinnamon sky  
Riding along on a horse he calls Music  
With a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye  
  
He dreams of a time, and a lady that loved him  
And how he would sing her sweet lullaby's  
But we don't ever ask him, and he never talks about her  
I guess its just better that we all let it slide  
  
[Chorus]  
And he sings ooh to the ladies  
And ooh he makes 'em sigh  
Then he rides away on a horse he calls Music  
With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye  
  
Now he rode the Music from Boston to Bozman  
For not too much money, and way too much ride  
But those were the days when a horse he called Music  
Could jump through the moon and scale across the sky  
  
Now all that's left is an old time worn cowboy  
With only his dreams of the days long gone by  
And trailin' behind is a horse with no rider  
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
High on a mountain in western Montana  
Two crossed cut through a cinnamon sky  
Marking the place where a horse he called Music  
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet by and by

Carolers are singing  
Snowflakes drifting through the air  
Everybody shopping  
Got no time for stopping  
It looks like Christmas is here  
(So tell me)  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?  
I want to give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Won't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your loving arms will have to do  
  
At first I thought of giving you a pretty golden ring  
Wore myself out shopping for a million other things  
Finally decided on something you can't buy  
But how will I disguise it so you will be surprised?  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?  
I want to give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Won't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your loving arms will have to do  
  
The gift of love was given to the world so long ago  
Lying in a manger he was wrapped in swaddling clothes  
Every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above  
And give to one another our little gifts of love  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for christmas?  
I want to give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Won't fit the gift I'm givin'

No one here to share this lonely bedroom

Or tired to count the stars up in the sky

I felt weak inside  
I searched my heart and mind  
For words I couldn't find  
Somehow you seemed to see  
What came over me that night  
As a love began to grow  
That would last for all time  
And you said,  
I can see it in your eyes  
They're the windows to your soul  
Sometimes they say more  
Than words could ever hold  
We could wait a thousand lifetimes  
And never feel like this again  
But when you look at me that way  
I can see it in your eyes  
Later on I asked your hand  
And I prayed the time was right  
I knelt down on one knee  
And said would you be my bride?  
And the sound of silence  
Filled the air  
As your tears fell with mine  
You didn't have to say a word  
For me to realize  
And I said,  
I can see it in your eyes  
They're the windows to your soul  
I see dreams come alive  
And future plans unfold  
I could wait a thousand lifetimes  
And not find a perfect love again  
But when you look at me that way  
I can see it in your eyes  
Many years have come and gone  
And what a life we've made  
How again we search for words  
As the heart inside me breaks  
Until death do we part  
Were the vows we made  
And now the time has come  
But goodbye is so hard to say  
I can see it your eyes  
They're the windows to your soul  
The light of life is burning low  
Soon you're leaving me I know  
The time that's left is precious dear  
So please don't shed another tear  
You don't have to say a word  
I can see it in your eyes  
I've heard you say a thousand times  
I'll love you dear until I die  
But you don't have to say a word

And told you I was yours forever  
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand  
Would we get that old-time feeling  
  
Would we laugh and talk for hours  
The way we did when our love first began  
Would you tell me that you've missed me too  
And that you've been so lonely  
  
And you've waited for the day that I returned  
And we'd live and love forever  
And that I'm your one and only  
Or would you say the tables finally turned  
  
And would you say...

Back when I was still in school  
I got taught as a rule  
That my heart could always fool my head  
So I tripped and fell a lot  
Learning what true love was not  
Till one evening Mama said we ought to talk  
  
She said love is a gamble  
It's a chance that you take  
You lay your heart down  
And you bet it won't break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Won't get tattered and torn  
But when that happens  
You must shake off those blues  
Just remember you've got nothing to lose  
But you've had true love since the day you were born  
Since the day you were born  
  
Then she told me all she knew  
About what makes true love true  
And it hasn't much to do with heat  
Young hearts race and then grow still  
Passion cools and always will  
But a river just keeps filling up the sea  
  
You see love is a gamble  
It's a chance that you take  
You lay your heart down  
And you bet it won't break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Won't get tattered and torn  
But when that happens  
You must dream up some more  
When you find it you'll have seen it before  
But you've had true love  
Since the day you were born  
  
Love is a gamble  
It's a chance that you take  
To lay your heart down  
And you bet it won't break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Won't get tattered and torn

And just remember you got nothing to lose

As a full moon  
Peaks over the hills.  
  
A blanket for my bed  
A saddle for my head

Back across the miles  
To where my darlin' smiles  
In memories of old Santa Fe.

As I kissed her softly

I go back there  
In my dreams  
And in my prayers

Loretta said this ain't no kind of way to raise a family  
And one night she called it quits and called a cab  
She left her clothes out on the clothes line  
And the dishes in the sink  
So I guess she knows that she ain't coming back

I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved  
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was  
  
Now lately she's been knowin' this old boy she met in church  
And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more  
I gave him the right to tell my wife that I can't come around

And Loretta took my keys and she made me wait outside

And now that you mentioned it, I can't believe  
That anyone could ever leave a love so sweet

It's hard to find a buddy like you  
And you're more than welcome

But it's all that I have since she's gone  
One black and white mem'ry  
Of the only love I've ever known  
One moment in time  
When we were together  
A page from the past  
To haunt me forever  
A constant reminder that hearts heal much slower than bones  
Chorus:  
Now my whole world's in one 8x10  
With 4 metal walls holding it in  
Through one plate glass window  
'neath a blanket of dust  
Stands an 8x10 picture of us  
I wish I'd have told her what I felt inside  
Back when her sweet love was growing like wine  
I wish she'd come back and love me again  
The way that she loved me in that old 8x10  
Now the silence I deaf'ning  
As the date turns to dark  
Her presence gets stronger with each beat of my heart  
I pretned that she's here  
And we've made a new start  
And for a moment  
She's back in my arms

There's an 8x10 picture of us

Randy Travis,Rise And Shine,/r/randy+travis/rise+and+shine_20305536.html,"A baby in a manger  
The town of Bethlehem  
The wise men had the heart  
To know He was the great I Am  
They crossed the desert many miles  
To kneel down at His feet  
The star that led them seemed  
To tell them what had come to be  
The Son's gonna rise and shine  
Make the lame walk, the deaf talk  
And give sight back to the blind  
Bring a light into the darkness  
No one can deny  
As sure as there's a Heaven  
The Son's gonna rise and shine  
At the age of thirty-three  
The prophecy fulfilled  
On the cross at Calvary  
His blood for man was spilled  
The sky was black as midnight  
But 'neath the dark and gloom  
Voices rang and Angels sang  
Dancing 'round the tomb  
The Sons's gonna rise and shine  
He'll take away the keys of death  
The grave will loose its bind  
Hell will be defeated  
In three days of time  
On resurrection morning  
The Son's gonna rise and shine  
It's been two thousand years  
But the story's still the same  
For those who will believe in Him  
And call upon His name  
The Son's gonna rise and shine  
Heal the sick, raise the dead  
The Savior of mankind  
The day will soon be dawning  
Will be the end of time  
King of kings, Lord of Lords  
The Son's gonna rise and shine  
Jesus, Son of Glory  
Will save your soul and mine?  
Brother are you ready  
The Son's gonna rise and shine?

Bond hair like a halo around her did flow  
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely

And the crash of the coffee cup up against the bedroom wall  
  
In the kitchen early in the mornin'  
Midnight walkin' the floor  
Without your cryin', cussin' and your moanin'  
Home ain't home anymore  
  
So come on, honey  
Come home and spend my money  
Come back, mama, and take another swing at me  
  
I told my friends how I sent you runnin'  
Cause you didn't do me right  
But if I looked up and saw you comin'  
You could do me wrong all night  
  
So come on, honey  
Come home and spend my money  
Come back, mama, and take another swing at me

Randy Travis,That Was Us,/r/randy+travis/that+was+us_20317170.html,"Twenty dollars out of momma's purse bought  
us a tank of gas  
And some Redman tobacco  
when we were just teenage kids  
Me and my old buddy Leroy,  
we'd go driving around  
If there was trouble to be found,  
then man we dang sure did  
Cutting doughnuts in the fields  
'Till old man Smith would call the cops  
He'd come runnin' out with a shotgun cause we were runnin' down his crops  
And I reckon he's still wonderin' who that was  
But that was us  
  
Now some of these old local boys moved on  
but we never changed a bit  
Never had a lick of sense, least that's what  
some folks said  
Then finally we turned old enough to buy our  
own beer  
Don't remember much about that year,  
just lucky we ain't dead  
  
'Cause somebody said they saw some boys  
With a truck looked just like mine  
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank  
That sits out on the country line  
And people wonder why it leans the way it does  
That was us  
  
Seems like small towns never change  
But things get tough when times get hard  
And they said when he got sick  
Old man Smith would've lost the farm  
'Cause he was getting' way behind on all his bills  
'Till somebody brought his crops in from the fields  
Yeah and folks 'round here still wonder who  
that was  
  
That was us

Something was wrong tonight  
When I found the note you wrote ,it gave  
The blues in black and white

Color my world without you in it  
And the future don't look too bright  
Darlin' its not a pretty picture

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep  
  
[Chorus]  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night

The star drew night to the northwest  
Over Bethlehem it took its rest  
And there it did both stop and stay  
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Touched the heart of one  
Who listened  
As the congregation prayed  
There'd been an invitation  
Inviting all to come but kneeling  
Down to pray was only one  
For only one, He would have suffered  
And given up His life for only one  
He'd have borne the shame  
And made the sacrifice  
For God so loved the whole world  
He gave His only Son but I believe  
He'd have done the same  
For only one

With only one or two?

When the only one is you

Don't be ashamed to come

Ray Boltz,The Ballad Of William Joe,/r/ray+boltz/the+ballad+of+william+joe_20156040.html,"The Ballad Of William Joe  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
William Joe was the son of a farmer  
Who lived out on the plains  
William Joe never had too much  
Just a horse and his name  
Then one day  
He said goodbye to his mama  
Said, I've got to ride away  
I've got to find out  
What life is, papa  
I'm leaving home today  
Well, his mama ran and fetched him  
A sack of apples  
And she kissed him on the cheek  
She said, Son, we don't have much  
But these apples sure are sweet  
And as the young man  
Climbed upon his horse  
Silhouetted against the sky  
His papa nodded and his mama waved  
And they both had tears in their eyes  
As they watched him ride on  
Ride on, ride on  
William Joe rode for miles and miles  
As he went from town to town  
But each one seemed to be the same  
And peace he never found  
Well he'd seen the oceans  
He's seen the mountains  
And he'd seen the forests green  
He'd seen cities and he's seen deserts  
But he's never seen his dreams  
Then his mind went back  
To a sack of apples  
He reached down in one day  
And at the bottom of the sack of apples  
His papa's Bible lay  
And he could still remember the last words  
His papa said to him  
He said, Son, love will be here waiting  
Till you come home again  
You'll just ride on  
Ride on, ride on, ride on  
The evening sun was setting  
As he knelt down in the dirt  
And tears of repentance  
Began erasing all the hurt  
He closed his eyes  
And bowed his head  
And gave his heart to the Lord  
He finally found the freedom  
He'd been so long searching for  
Now it's tim

Ray Boltz,The Gift,/r/ray+boltz/the+gift_20204611.html,"For them there were no presents  
Around the Christmas tree  
No flashing lights unless you count  
The lamp across the street  
A fire in a barrel  
No chimney and no roof  
To most of them Santa Claus  
Was the man who made the soup  
  
In an alley was a mother  
Two children by her side  
Trying hard to keep the spark  
Of true Christmas alive  
She said we may not have some things  
That other people do  
But Christmas is for everyone  
And were Gods children too  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
I don't think Santa's comin'  
Cause he don't know where we live  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
  
Well early Christmas morning  
While they were still asleep  
I packed a box of food and clothes  
And walked back to their street  
Imagine my surprise  
When I saw presents all around  
Blankets, toys and winter coats  
Beside them on the ground  
And the card I read from Santa said  
Inside the three of you  
The real heart of Christmas  
Is still beating strong and true  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
Santa Claus is comin  
Cause he know where real faith lives  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift

Ray Boltz,The Potter's Field,/r/ray+boltz/the+potters+field_20299867.html,"The Potter's Field  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I fell asleep the other day  
Dreamed that I was falling  
And I woke up in a field of clay  
Voices were calling  
In the potter's field  
In the potter's field  
The broken pieces  
Lying on the ground...  
It was the strangest thing...  
Got up and began to dance around  
And I heard them sing  
chorus:  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
Nothing is concealed  
'Cause everything is broken  
In the potter's field  
In the potter's field  
And they sang about the garden  
Where Jesus was betrayed  
And how Judas tried to take back  
All the money he'd been paid  
How the money bought the field of dirt  
The money bought the mud  
But all the broken pieces  
We have been purchased by the Blood  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything that's broken  
In the potter's field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything that's broken  
Everything that's broken  
In the potter's field  
In the potter's field

We don't really know her name  
But the way she was treated  
Was a shame  
She heard the angry voices  
There was nothing  
That she could say  
It wouldn't have mattered anyway  
All she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
She felt so helpless  
So all alone  
How she longed  
For the face of a friend  
But oh  
All she saw were the stones  
They pulled her from her lover's arms  
Out into the street  
They drug her to the synagogue  
And threw her at Christ's feet  
This woman is an adulteress  
And our law is very clear  
The Master saw her looking down  
Her eyes were filled with tears  
'Cause all she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
She felt so helpless  
So all alone  
How she longed  
For the face of a friend  
But oh  
All she saw were the stones  
Jesus looked up from the crowd  
And then He said to them  
You be the first to cast a stone  
If you have never sinned  
One by one they walked away  
They left the stones behind  
I wish, I could have seen her face  
When she opened up her eyes  
'Cause all she saw were the stones  
All she saw were the stones  
Jesus said, ?I forgive you, go and sin no more?  
She knew she'd never be the same  
Oh no, all she saw were the stones

Words and music by Ray Boltz  
He was standing in heaven  
With tears in his eyes  
Saying, tell me this isn't so  
For there was one in heaven  
And no one on earth  
Worthy to open the scroll  
Then one of the elders  
Said, John don't you cry  
It was all part of the plan  
Then in the center  
Of Gods glorious throne  
Hallelujah, there stood a lamb  
And they sang worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
They were casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he cried, who is worthy?  
I can hear Jesus saying, I am  
Oh, praise God, forever  
There stood a Lamb  
Now open your Bible  
Open your heart  
Its clear we are in last days  
And he said Ill come quickly  
So don't be surprised  
When he comes back to take us away  
And feeble excuses wont get very far  
When you find yourself  
There at His throne  
If you know Jesus  
And He is your Lord  
Hallelujah, you won't be alone  
And well sing worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
Well be casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he says, are you worthy?  
I can hear Jesus saying, I am  
Oh, praise God, forever  
There stood a Lamb  
And well sing worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
As we cast down our crowns  
Well be praising his name  
When he says, are you worthy?  
I can hear Jesus saying, I am

Ray Boltz,Watch The Lamb,/r/ray+boltz/watch+the+lamb_20348109.html,"Walking on the road to Jerusalem,  
The time had come to sacrifice again,  
My two small sons,  
They walked beside me on the road,  
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb.  
  
""Daddy, daddy, What will see there,  
There's so much that we don't understand"",  
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".  
""There will be so many in Jerusalem today,  
We must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"",  
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".  
  
When we reached the city,  
I knew something must be wrong,  
There were no joyful worshipers,  
No joyful worship songs,  
I stood there with my children  
in the midst of angry men,  
Then I heard the crowd cry out  
""Crucify Him"".  
  
We tried to leave the city but  
we could not get away,  
Forced to play in this drama  
a part I did not wish to play,  
""Why upon this day were men condemned to die?,  
Why were we standing here, Where soon they would pass by?"".  
  
I looked and said, ""even now they come"",  
The first one cried for mercy,  
The people gave him none,  
The second one was violent,He was arrogant and loud,  
I still can hear his angry voice  
screaming at the crowd,  
Then someone said ""there's Jesus"",  
I could scarce believe my eyes,  
A man so badly beaten,  
He barely looked alive,  
Blood poured from His body,  
From the thorns upon His brow,  
Running down the cross, Falling to the ground.  
  
I watched Him as He struggled,  
I watched Him as He fell,  
The cross came down upon His back,  
The crowd began to yell,  
In that moment I felt such agony,  
In that moment I felt such loss,  
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm  
and screamed, ""you, carry His cross"".  
  
At first I tried to resist him,  
Then his hand reached for his sword,  
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord,  
I placed it on my shoulder,  
And started down the street,  
The blood that he'd been shedding  
was running down my cheek.  
  
They led us to Golgotha,  
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands,  
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray  
""Father, forgive them"".  
  
Oh, never have I seen such love in any other eyes,  
""Into thy hands I commit my spirit""  
He prayed and then He died,  
  
I stood for what seemed like years,  
I'd lost all sense of time until  
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine,  
My children stood there weeping,  
I heard the oldest say,  
""Father please forgive us,the lamb ran away"".  
  
""Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here?,  
There's so much that we don't understand"",  
So I took them in my arms,  
And we turned and faced the cross,  
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb""

Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Bessie can still remember  
Like it was yesterday  
She watched her husband, Oliver  
Kneel in the church and pray  
That was what she had been hoping for  
Still she was so surprised  
Was that a glow upon his face?  
Or just the tears in her eyes?  
Hed always been a quiet man  
Everyone saw the change  
Reaching to take a strangers hand  
Asking to know their name  
Sunday mornings theyd be in church  
And after the pastor prayed  
Year after year with a voice so dear  
Bessie would hear him say  
Chorus:  
This is where I met Jesus  
I heard him calling my name  
I was so glad to meet Him  
He was so glad I came  
Oh, how she misses Oliver  
Now that she lives alone  
One night while they were sound asleep  
The angels took her love home  
Oh, how she cried  
There were no goodbyes  
It seemed he was gone so soon  
Then one night she heard his voice  
When she walked into their room

Bessie, one day youll do the same

Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky  
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

Puttin' my face on,

I enjoy procrastinating  
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin away  
  
Sittin' and dinin' (dining)  
Dinner beginnin',  
Started designin'  
Usin' the linen,  
  
Talkin' to my date,  
Doodlin' my bit,  
Waiter got salty,  
Told me to please quit  
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,  
""Can't you see I'm very busy,

""Do you doodle all day?""  
Asked the waiter in his way,  
""Do you doodle all night?""  
Told the waiter he was right,  
""In your doodlin' way-""  
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""  
""Are you thinkin' things right?""  
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""

""Ain't nothing you can do,""  
""With old doodlin' you,""  
""Doodin's all I want to do,""  
  
That's for true!  
  
Why does every single thing I see  
Look exactly like a doodle to me?  
If I ever have a doubt  
What life is all about  
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin'  
And I find it real relaxing  
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!  
  
'Cause weird designs  
They only show what's going on  
In weirder minds  
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind  
Every little thing that you write  
Just conceivably might  
Be a thought that you capture  
While coppin' a wink  
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see  
When you write what you think.  
  
I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',  
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,  
I'd be tempest-tossed  
Without my doodlin',  
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,  
  
Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out  
What my doodlin's all about.  
  
Later the waiter  
Had me arrested,  
Took me to Bellevue,  
Where I was tested.  
  
Had me a doctor  
Probin' my noodle,  
'Fore he was half-done,  
Taught him to doodle,  
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger  
Find an outlet through your finger,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.  
  
Doctor was real nice,  
Told me to be cool,  
Looked at the waiter,  
Called him the real fool,  
  
Looked at my baby  
Told me he dug her,  
Got me to doodlin',  
So he could bug her,  
  
When he put his arms around her,  
Quite to his surprise he found her,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away  
  
We just doodle all day!

He was a king uncrowned  
I know I'll always remember  
The warmth of his sound  
Linger so long I'm sure he's still around  
For those who heard they respect him yet  
So those who hear won't forget  
The sound of each phrase  
Echoes the time uncountable by days  
The things he played are with us now  
And they'll endure should time allow  
Oh yes I remember Clifford  
I seem to always feel him near somehow  
Every day I hear his lovely tone  
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all it's own  
So how can we say someone so real has really gone away?  
I hear him now, and always will  
Believe me I remember Clifford still.

None of us are free  
None of us are free

Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see  
None of us are free, one of us is chained  
None of us are free, now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find  
None of us can find it on our own  
We've got to join together in spirit, heart and mind  
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained

You're gonna see what I say  
'Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day  
Now it's time to start making changes  
And it's time for us all to realize  
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes

We trade a couple words and looks

Crime is everywhere  
There's always some sad story going down  
  
You can read it in the paper  
You can see it on the air  
It's an evil epidemic going round  
  
But nobody seems to notice  
The saddest crime of all  
Oh just how many times a day  
Someone takes their love away  
And the national statistics  
Never put it in the chart  
But every second someone breaks a heart  
  
There's a woman out there somewhere  
Who feels she lost her life  
But her man just shot her world down  
And it hurts  
  
There's a guy who just got taken  
And it cuts him like a knife  
Some girl stole his heart and left him  
Without a world  
  
They don't call it a crime of passion  
But it kills you just the same  
It's murder when a true love dies  
Right before your very eyes  
  
And as soon as one is over  
Another one will start  
Every second someone breaks  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
  
If you've got someone who loves you  
Be careful all the time  
Do you know where your love is tonight  
Cause there's always someone trying  
To find the perfect crime  
And you never know just when  
They'll strike  
  
So you better watch your woman  
And you better watch your man  
Cause no one's safe when love's at stake  
Anybody's heart can break  
  
And the next time that it happens  
You're not the losing part  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
Every second someone breaks a heart

Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents

A kid out of school, trying to find my way.  
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play.  
I'm just a new fool at an old game.  
  
Maybe I'm a dreamer, or maybe I'm naive.  
But when you say you love me I start to believe  
That coal can turn to diamonds.  
And this night will never end.  
But if it isn't so, and I cry when you go.

Reflections of yesterday's past  
Now headlines and foot lights  
The hours of long nights keep everything  
Moving so fast  
  
It's taken a long time  
And she's walked a thin line  
The fame and fortune arrived  
  
She kept on striving  
Way of surviving  
Till part of those dreams came alive

And she wishes she looks like  
They tell her she looks like all the time  
What she'd give just to feel like  
She tells them she's feeling  
Just fine  
All that money she makes every night  
Ain't as much as it seems  
A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream  
  
Her heart may be breaking  
But she keeps on taking  
What she thought she wanted way back when  
It's too late to change her  
There's always a stranger  
To tell her she's someone again

The rest of the gang by noon  
We spent the day watching football and breaking in toys  
Helping out in the kitchen  
Catching up on old news

We all took our places

Before anyone else could utter a word

And she started to say

Bow my head, the axe we grind  
Ruse cruise, P's and Q's

Deep hits, the media blitz  
Lost my mind to keep my wits  
Maintain the same old same  
Goodbye shiz and so long game

So throw down your guns  
You see it doesn't matter  
Where you come from  
You could be from park ave  
Or from a park bench  
You could be a politician  
Or a bitchy princess  
But if you're lookin' for a fist  
And you're lookin' to unite  
Put your knuckleheads together  
Make a fist and fight  
Not to your death  
And not to your grave

Of being sick and tired  
If you're sick of all the bullshit  
And you're sick of all the lies  
It's better late than never  
To set-a-set it straight  
You know the lie is dead  
So give your self a break  
Get it through your head  
Get if off your chest  
Get it out your arm  
Because it's time to start fresh  
You want to stop dying  
The life you could be livin'  
I'm here to tell a story  
But I'm also here to listen  
No I'm not your preacher  
And I'm not your physician  
I'm just trying to reach you  
I'm a rebel with a mission

There should be no...in the land of lands  
It's a Hollywood jam  
  
You say you're running and you're running  
And you're running afraid  
You say you ran across the planet  
But you couldn't get away  
The fire in your brain  
Was driving you insane  
You were looking for a day  
In a life that never came  
So don't tell me that  
I've got to take a number  
Cause I've been to that doctor  
And believe me that's a bummer  
Here's a one of a kind  
Convention of the mind  
And don't forget to mention  
That it doesn't cost a dime  
Come as you like  
And leave any time  
And one more thing  
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

Don't be a slave

Mackin' on a cat's ass  
One upper cut  
To the cold upper middle class  
Born to storm  
On boredom's face  
And a little lust  
To the funky ass flea bass

Just lose their grace  
The blackest hole  
In all of space  
Crooked as a hooker  
Now suck my thumb  
Anybody want to come get some

In my third eye  
Searchin' for a soul bride  
She's my freakette  
Soak it up inside  
Deeper than a secret  
Much more  
Than meets the eye  
To the funk  
I fall into my new ride  
My hand my hand  
Magic on the one  
Is a medicine man  
Thinkin' of a few  
Taboos that I ought to kill  
Dancin' on their face  
Like a stage on vaudeville  
  
I feel so good  
Can't be understood  
Booty of a hoodlum  
Rockin' my red hood

Oh I wonder, could I say how I felt and not be misunderstood?  
A thousand stars came into my system,  
I never knew how much I have missed them.  
Slap, on the lap, of my heart you landed,  
I was coy, but you made me candid,  
And now the planets circle around you,  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you.

Playing in me like a wonderland  
But if you left I would be two foot small  
And every tear would be a waterfall  
Soundless, boundless, I surround you  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you.  
  
I just didn't know.  
  
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you

On his way back gets a little skin  
From the hand of a man named a. c. green  
Slam so hard break your t.v. screen  
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk  
Take it to the hole make your mamma talk  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble  
L.A. Lakers fast break makers  
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact  
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly  
Cause they got more moves  
That a bowl full of jelly  
The buck stops here - pops - then cheers  
A roar through the forum  
That deafens my ears  
The one and only know if his kind  
Sits in a throne  
Not for the records that he holds  
But for being bald and bold  
Kareem Abdul Jabbar  
All time great super super star  
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble  
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble  
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson  
L.A. Lakers fast break makers  
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers  
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact

Magpies on fire  
Making love like little whirls on out the porch can lead to medicine  
Oh well, I'm game for anything at all  
Scarecrows are liars  
Spins the yarn and no one ever checks it out to see if it was real  
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall  
All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love  
  
[Hook]  
What more do you want  
How much more can you take  
I love my mistakes  
I've been here before  
  
[Bridge]  
All in all it's just the call of something wild beyond your room  
There's a changing of the major chord  
Your minor thread will do, love  
  
[Verse 2]  
My gun misfired, shot myself instead  
I guess I always knew I'd be the one to lose  
Light screen door slams, time to make a move  
  
[Hook]

All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love  
A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl  
A bird who never really had a say

All along it's like a bird who's now been freed from someone's cage

Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000  
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers

Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,  
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation

There's a time there's a place for me  
In a world where I can't be found  
Cold and mean people give me the creeps  
  
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams  
Got to get away gonna make it my home  
  
Losing my taste for the human race  
Social grace is a waste of time  
It's absurd when I look around  
So sublime that we blow my mind  
  
Naked in the rain with a killer whale  
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail  
  
[Chorus]  
Naked in the rain  
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret  
Give it to me doctor  
Don't keep it  
  
I never met an animal that I didn't like  
You can come to me I won't bite  
Don't you know dog is man's best friend  
There is some love that you can't fight  
  
Naked in the rain with black tattoos  
Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen to the talking heart in my chest  
With this gift good Lord I am blessed  
There's a lump and it's in my throat  
I'm in love with the wilderness  
  
Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way  
In the waterfall I just want to play

Because I can not fall  
Asleep tonight  
No not at all  
Head lights flash  
Across my bedroom wall  
Crying eyes open  
Because I can not fall  
In love with you  
  
No not at all  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid  
  
Busted in two  
Like a brittle stick  
I can not drink  
Because my throat constricts  
Lovesick from you  
That will never do  
Open my mouth  
I couldn't make a sound  
I could not scream  
I could not shout  
It out to you  
Nothing to do  
  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid  
  
This may come as a shocking surprise  
I have to take a walk  
I have to kiss it goodbye  
Goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love  
I am not alive  
  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid

Breath to be sure of this

Surrender rises high and I  
Gave what I came to give  
Say it now because you never know  
  
Devil may cry devil may care  
Distiller's got a scream  
And now I know just why  
When she's movin' air  
Can you feel the voltage  
This is my time

Got room to spare

Too shrewd to blow the interlude  
Sustaining pain to set a mood  
Step out to be renewed

Jungle brothers on the microphone  
Getting over with an undertone  
It's time to turn to stone  
  
Chitty chitty, baby  
When your nose is in the nitty gritty  
Life could be a little sweet  
But life could be a little shitty  
What a pity  
Boston and a Kansas city  
Looking for a hundred

You ring just like a xylophone  
Devoted to the chromosome  
The day that you left home

The world is all aglow again  
With all these season brings  
And though it comes around each year  
The meaning of the season seems to disappear

Christmas is for girls and boys  
Trimming trees and Santa's toys  
It's mom and dad, and grandma, grandpa too  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.  
  
Sleepy eyes are open wide  
And tiny hearts beat fast  
To celebrate the morning  
Just like every Christmas past  
We gathered close to family  
Embracing all that's been  
And all that's yet to be  
Oh it's good to be reminded  
  
Christmas is the candle light  
Jingle bells and silent night  
Friends from long ago  
And friends and we've made anew  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.  
  
From where it all began  
One night in Bethlehem  
Reaches out to all of us  
Reminds us once again  
  
Christmas is for everyone  
The greatest gift of all the stuff  
The star that shines on all the world  
The light that leads us through  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.

And although the melody lives on

And the world still sings of love I know

The promises we've made seemed easier then  
As if we knew our love would never end  
But sesond change and time erases the tears  
As swiftly as the ripples disappear

Sa minumutya, sa diwa at gawa  
Paka isipin natin kung pag-ibig ay wagas  
Kahit pa magsanga ng landas  
III.  
Minsan dalawang puso'y  
Nagsumpaan pag-big nawalang hanggan  
Sumpang kastiyong buhangin pala  
Pag-ibig na pagsamantala  
(Repeat Refrain, III)  
Minsan dalawang puso'y  
Nagsumpaan pag-big nawalang hanggan  
Sumpang kastiyong buhangin pala  
Pansamantala, luha ang dala  
'Yan ang pag-ibig na nangyari sa atin  
Gumuhong kastiyong buhangin.....

Are written in the pages

Reason to be strong and carry on

Inside the freedom that love allows

There's just one happened with you  
Till we saw the light and let it go

When you loved me you gave me hope  
I'll keep those memories inside of my heart  
If you see that you need a friend  
I will be there until the end  
Now I continue on like this until the future brings me  
Someone to fill the space I only have for now

At time he stress another face in the clouds  
But each time he smiles, that's when I stumble  
I'm so proud he's the one that I love  
Refrain:  
Oh, he's good, he's my boy  
True his strength, I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yes, he may be so old-fashioned  
At times, he dresses in a way out of style  
Oh, each time he holds me, and that's when I stumble  
I'm so proud he's the one that I love  
(Repeat Refrain)  
He's my boy,  
I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yeah, he's not rich neither handsome  
Then I'm not myself a queen nor a star  
Oh, but I know for sure  
I know that he cares for me  
I'm so proud he's the one  
I'm so glad I'm the girl that he chooses to have  
I'm so proud he's the one...

We were moving mountains long  
Before we knew we could oh yes

Who knows what miracles you can achieve  
When you believe, somehow you will  
You will when you believe oh yeah  
  
In this time of fear  
When prayers so often prove in vain  
Hope seems like the summer birds  
So swiftly flown away  
  
Yet now I'm standing here  
My heart's so full I can't explain  
Seeking faith and speaking words  
I never thought I'd say  
  
There can be miracles, when you believe When you believe  
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill

And it's easy to give in to your fears oh  
But when your blinded by your pain  
Can't see your way straight through the rain

To greet me urge me to go on  
Is there no home for me  
To even love again  
  
Will there really be a morning  
Or is this the end  
Will there really be a sunrise when  
The darkness dies  
Will the strength to last'll be there  
To fight the fears inside  
The nights are so endless  
Endless as it seems  
  
Will there really be a morning or  
Is this a dream  
Days have come and days have passed  
I wish the morning stayed  
I pray that they would last  
For in those mornings I  
Could see what it meant to be free  
Will there really be light again  
When this tunnel fades  
Will I reach out and touch it  
Ir will I be afraid

To know no gain nor loss.

I can go no longer.""

Tread thou in them boldly  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage  
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

But now you'll take me in again  
  
Well Jesus loves me fine.

Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,  
""We don't have a prayer between us.""

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?

And I don't know which way to go  
If you offered me your world, did you think I'd really stay?  
If you offered me the heavens, I would have to turn away.

Footprints in the sand  
Washed away without a warnin'  
When the water hit the land

And I'll take you by the hand and we'll...

There's a chill in the air  
It's coolin down my skin tonight  
Soakin' through your hair  
There's warmth enough within tonight for both of us to share  
We can take it anywhere and we'll...  
  
Live every moment

Leave all this trouble, heartache and pain for another day  
I will search for that place  
But till I find it all I can say is..  
  
Live every moment  
And love every day

Leave all this trouble, heartache and pain for another day

I cannot hold you in a poison rain  
If I can't see you through the air that we breathe  
What will love in the future be?  
  
I want to watch my children laugh as they run  
I want to hold their children on my knee  
And tell them stories of a vanishing sun  
Of how it used to be  
  
In my lover's life I want to share  
I want to see the world now through her eyes  
And about everything she sees, I care  
The time has come to rise  
  
I cannot bathe you in a river gone black  
I cannot hold you in a poison rain  
If I can't see you through the air that we breathe  
What will love in the future be?  
Will we make it a different story?  
Is there love in the future for you and me?  
  
We're looking for answers in outer space  
When will we discover the earth is a sacred place?

Reo Speedwagon,Love Is A Rock,/r/reo+speedwagon/love+is+a+rock_20115714.html,"My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock

But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
Headed out into uncharted waters  
What you feel is your only guide  
And each step that you take brings you closer  
Just trust what you feel inside  
Cause something's telling you to keep on going  
Telling you that your aim is true  
Could be the voice of reason, or just blind devotion  
Whatever it is, it's calling out to you, singing  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
Mixed messages shoot through a wire  
Tender turmoil in your voice  
Change is spreading through you like a fire  
Bridges are burning, you made your choice  
And as you're searching for peace in your world  
You may find yourself spinning around, and around, and around  
While the pain you've endured  
Only serves to make you surer  
Of the strength you have found, and then  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock  
  
You may not be looking for love, but love may find you  
You may choose to close your eyes and run  
You may leave love far behind you  
In your eyes I can see the future  
In your heart I can always trust  
In your mind I will live on forever  
In your arms I will turn to dust  
These are feelings like I have never known  
The song of my very soul  
I can no longer silently sing it  
I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing  
  
My love is a rock, an immovable force  
Anywhere that you are, my love is right here  
With any tick of the clock  
Life can change it's course  
Some things are here and then gone before you know  
Some things disappear without a chance to grow  
But my love will not  
My love is a rock

The sun was pourin' and the rain was gettin' deep  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do  
'Cause everywhere I turn, I wind up headin' back to you  
  
I don't know how long I will lay here in this bed  
Staring at the ceiling, going crazy in my head  
Got to find some meaning, some kind of reason to go on  
The only one I had was you and now you're gone, and

My friends all tell me I should mellow out  
Surely I've got better things to think about  
Must be something I can find to help me lose these blues

His little sister died at the age of four

Like right out of some kind of Rockwell scene

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door  
Everybody loves to point their finger  
They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door  
Willy later said, ""He really should've known  
The boy spent too much time on his own  
And what was on his mind, God only knew""  
One by one the neighbors went away  
A gruesome little game Jake taught himself to play  
His daddy always said, ""Find something to do""

Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door

One less mistake to think about  
'Cause no one read the writing on the wall  
So much for case 1239  
Covered up, curled up in a ball  
One little page in the history of crime  
Lawyers made a fortune for their time  
Seems an explanation was never found  
And I hope this tale won't be misunderstood  
Things ain't the same in every neighborhood  
But before you go to sleep tonight, look around

They don't hear the crying  
Streets of pain  
Never felt the tears  
Streets of pain  
They just keep on lying  
Get it through your head  
'Cause some things never change  
  
Won't it finally be obvious  
That there's very little chance  
Can't they see it's a Greyhound bus  
And not their handsome prince  
Isn't anybody satisfied  
With the average girl next door  
Does she have to be glamourized  
So the world will love her more  
  
Streets of pain  
Sinking like a rock in a river  
Streets of pain  
Never felt so cold  
Streets of pain  
Lower than a snake can slither  
Not to mention all the  
Stories never told  
  
Pretty girl becomes a socialite  
Standing in somebody elses light  
Anything can happen late at night  
In the morning she'll be out of sight  
Made a million on a lucky streak  
Threw it all away as foolishly  
One of many comic tragedies  
What else can there be  
  
So you better get on the road  
To the desolation station  
And you better bring all you own  
It's a permanent vacation  
We're waiting here with open arms  
But it isn't what it seems  
Just looking for the boulevard  
On the trail of broken dreams

A solitary glance  
And I could hear the voice of rapture call  
I've loved you from a distance  
Afraid to take a chance  
But now it seems I cant't help but to fall  
  
Imagine my surprise  
To open my eyes  
And find that you were looking back  
  
And suddenly  
I cannot remember who I used to be  
Like the rain this yearning washes over me  
And all the pain I knew before is gone  
Yeah, suddenly  
I'm no longer drifting on a empty sea  
Now I know that I believe in destiny  
And mine is waiting right here in your arms  
  
I long to wake beside you  
And battle in loves abyss  
Washing all that's come before away  
And in that frozen moment  
As I receive your kiss  
There will not be enough words to say  
  
I wanna make you melt  
Touch you like no one else  
And do it all again a thousand times

Got the offers rollin' in but you're

Everybody wants to know what goes  
On in your head  
Pity if they found out that you're lonely  
In your bed  
Maybe it all happened to you just a  
Little too fast  
  
Won't let anybody touch you

Cryin' out for help

You face the end of your youth in a tired  
Little masquerade  
You talk to people with a tongue like a  
Newly sharpened razor blade  
Yours is not a life that lets you take a  
Look inside  
Morals and convictions meet a fate of  
Genocide  
But in the end you'll be sleeping in the  
Bed you made  
  
All you want's a daddy  
The one you never had  
A need for understanding  
Aching in your head  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your money won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, it seems so clear to me  
There's something that you'd rather be  
  
Take a look around you now  
Before it's much too late  
Make the choice to change  
Or be a victim of your fate  
All your life you've been  
Running from the girl inside  
  
You're a superstar, but you don't know  
Who you are  
And your fame won't get you very far  
You're a mystery, oh but it's plain to see

Still she walks away without even a scratch  
Leaving in flames

Richard Marx,What's Wrong With That,/r/richard+marx/whats+wrong+with+that_20116015.html,"I may be rotten to the core  
And stop me if you think I am  
A kid in a candy store  
The same as any dirty old man  
I know I'm not the first to see  
I guarantee I'm not the last  
  
So take some good advice from me  
Just try it once before you ask  
I hear an enticing voice  
(Live it up, live it up, do it now, boy)  
I don't like the other choice  
(Live it up, live it up)  
  
[Chorus]  
What's wrong with that  
What's wrong with the fountain of youth  
What's wrong with that  
What's wrong with a little self delusion  
  
Who you think is foolin' who  
And who will be the last to laugh  
Here's another lame excuse  
You're old enough to be her dad  
I've heard all the reasons why  
(Give it up, give it up, take a powder)  
I turn them my blindest eye  
(Give it up, give it up)

What's wrong with that  
What's wrong with a flower in bloom  
What's wrong with that  
What's wrong with a little self delusion  
  
Days don't hide secrets of the heart  
Only you and I do  
Little white lies rip you right apart  
And any way they want to  
Life goes by, done before you start  
I can't wait around to satisfy you

You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
Son, he says (what) I've got bad news  
Life is hard and you got the blues  
I know you're good I know you work hard  
I'm sorry, son, here are your cards  
I went home and kicked off my shoes  
And asked myself why do I always lose  
But then you rang and everything was fine  
I'm so glad that you are mine  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You're the one thing in my life  
That makes me feel so good inside  
Will you hold me tight tonight  
Oh, girl I wish you would decide  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right

Rihanna,A Child Is Born,/r/rihanna/a+child+is+born_20897863.html,"As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night  
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight  
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before  
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure  
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world  
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Oh yeah  
  
As I went down into the town to see what I could see  
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me  
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star  
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far  
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come  
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright

For you're heart on me

Whispers down the hall  
When I look there's nothing to see  
You say that you let her go  
Turn the page and closed the door  
Can't get inside your head  
'Cause when I try, she's there instead  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be

That you've moved on

Invisible chains keep us in pain  
Won't you please tell her set you free?  
Sometimes when you look past me  
Your eyes see someone I can't see  
So I've given up this war

See you haven't lost your sense of style

And I realize it's happenin'  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Here I go again  
  
Still remember how you make me weak  
How I fought to find the words to speak  
I just can't escape the memories  
I tried but I just can't break free  
But I closed the door on what we had  
But these feelings just keep comin' back  
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me

Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we  
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs  
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky  
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,  
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?  
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count  
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain  
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'  
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand  
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it  
With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Cause this love never felt so strong, but at the same time it feels so weak oh  
  
You know that you're hurting me, baby can't you see  
That your love is all I need, that your love is all I feel  
But I wonder is it still that real  
And every time that I put a smile on my face  
It's because I don't wanna loose you,  
It's because I know it will kill you  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
J-Me:  
  
So I, open up my eyes, open up this healing, that I've been feeling  
Don't know where it's taking me, don't know if it's you or me oho  
So I, just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean  
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go  
Never wanna leave your side  
  
I love the way you lie when you do it,  
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that you're making up  
And I'm so caught up in this love song,  
Do you really know what I long for  
I'm addicted to you, yes it is true  
Baby cause I want you to stay  
I hurt myself every day  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie

And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know  
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight  
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right  
And we both know that the story's ending  
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears  
Cause even though you're here  
It feels like you're a million miles away  
  
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?  
For what we were is like a season love is change  
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside  
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before  
While our song is playing its last note  
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)  
  
Say a prayer, to yourself

Sometimes it helps  
And then I get, a scary thought  
That he's here, means he's never lost

I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?

So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go  
  
[Chorus]  
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean  
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine  
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights  
If you can baby boy, than we can go all night  
Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five  
Baby you got the keys  
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive  
Shut up and drive, drive, drive  
  
I got class like a fifty-seven Cadillac  
Start over drive with a whole lot of boom in the back  
You look like you can handle what's under my hood  
You keeping saying that you will, boy I wish you would  
  
So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go

You play that game, got what I got  
Get it get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot  
Ain't a Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry  
I ain't need to worry, so step inside  
And ride, ride, ride  
  
So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go

Midair off of the cliff  
Staring down at the end again  
But then again maybe we're finally  
On the road that's heading away from all your complaining  
Of hearing the same song but baby we'll hear it when I'm gone  
  
It's time to turn on the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared  
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
It was ours  
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again  
But then again, maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget  
Maybe let 'em play it maybe it'll save the world  
They gonna miss her when it's gone  
  
But it's time to turn (on) up the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if we left every moment that we could spare  
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
You'll never know when the songs gonna play  
The last song you'll hear is the one you made  
This song was beautiful that's why I started singing it  
But this song is our song is playing until the end, even if its the last song  
  
The last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared

There's no time  
To give it one more try  
There's only time to say goodbye  
  
Fooled me once shame on you  
Fooled me twice now this song is through  
The things you said I can never forget  
The things you did for my heart went through bad  
But I'm still standin' tall as I walk away  
And you know that it's true when you hear me say  
It's over, it's through  
Ain't nothin' you can do boy it's sad but it's true

The brother had a lot of game  
Had me opened from the start  
  
He scoops me up in his ride  
Friday about a quarter to nine  
So fly and so fun  
And I'm so glad that he's all mine

Gives me everything I need

'Cause every night he's waiting on me  
He's got mad personality

Shadows chase me far from home

But it keeps avoiding me  
Sorrow in my soul  
'Cause it seems that wrong  
Really loves my company  
  
He's more than a man  
And this is more than love  
The reason that the sky is blue  
The clouds are rolling in  
Because I'm gone again  
And to him I just can't be true  
  
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful  
And it kills him inside  
To know that I am happy with some other guy  
I can see him dying  
  
I don't wanna do this anymore  
I don't wanna be the reason why  
Every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
I don't wanna hurt him anymore  
I don't wanna take away his life  
I don't wanna be  
A murderer  
  
I feel it in the air  
As I'm doing my hair  
Preparing for another date  
A kiss upon my cheek  
As he reluctantly  
Asks if I'm gonna be out late  
I say I won't be long  
Just hanging with the girls  
A lie I didn't have to tell  
Because we both know  
Where I'm about to go  
And we know it very well  
  
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful

Ride when we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
When we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
  
It's real late  
'Bout a quarter to one  
Thinkin' about everythang  
We become  
And I hate it  
I thought we could make it  
But I'm ready to scratch this  
Just wanna forget about it  
I saw the pictures  
And the letters she sent  
You had me thinkin'  
You were out we your friends  
I'm so foolish  
Treat me like I'm stupid  
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Visions in my mind  
Of the day that we met  
You showed me thangs  
That'll never forget  
Took me swimming  
In the ocean  
You had my head up in the clouds  
Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah)  
You think I'm playing  
When you now its the truth  
Nobody else can do it  
Quite like I do  
All my kisses  
And my lovin'  
But ain't nobody  
Better than us  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
I guess its over  
And definitely  
But you and I know  
Its not that easy  
To let go  
Of everything (everything) that we planned  
And start all over again  
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it  
I won't forget how you do it  
Sweet baby  
This is where the game ends now somehow  
Might not believe you and me  
We can figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You finna make me say boy  
I wish that you come hold me  
When I'm lonely  
When I need someone to talk to  
You would phone me  
Just like everything its on me  
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)  
Boy you forgot about the promises  
You made me  
And now we'll let the memories  
Just fade away  
But I remember  
What you used to say

The traffic is stuck  
And you're not moving anywhere  
You thought you'd found a friend  
To take you out of this place  
Someone you could lend a hand  
In return for grace  
It's a beautiful day  
Sky falls, you feel like  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
You're on the road  
But you've got no destination  
You're in the mud  
In the maze of her imagination  
You love this town  
Even if that doesn't ring true  
You've been all over  
And it's been all over you  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
It's a beautiful day  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Teach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
See the world in green and blue  
See China right in front of you  
See the canyons broken by cloud  
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out  
See the Bedouin fires at night  
See the oil fields at first light  
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth  
After the flood all the colours came out  
It was a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
Beautiful day  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Reach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
What you don't know you can feel it somehow  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
Don't need it now  
Was a beautiful day

I'm very excited to be here  
Yet again, it's an honor to be nominated  
Bla bla bla bla  
  
Well that Brits night was so fucking boring  
Past the days of yes, yes, Charlene  
Coke in the box til 7 in the morning  
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling  
When I had a bit of beef with you know who  
And I fucked a few female stars or two  
Nearly everything I said I'd end getting screwed  
Spitting at the... looking rude in the news  
Oh yes, you're still rocking with the best!  
Second person on my year to have touched a breast  
I'm nearly 40 now and I'm still impressed  
Here's the midlife crisis I guess.  
Oh I recall, taking in the wonder of it all  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I still want to get laid by you right!  
  
Now I know I've got fat but make no mistake  
Every million that I make they bake me a cake  
So I've got plenty, 120  
Wearing rows of tweed like the...  
I still want to get you naked  
I'll see you in the summer, so glad you could make it!  
I'll be that mega white thing, fast as lightening  
In... shape, but twice as frightening.  
If they can't be bothered, then I promise you this  
If they won't entertain you then I'll do my fucking best!

I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass

Would you let me live?

And I now that some of you are going to be really really cross  
The drug's stop working so prescription pills are boss  
The glory days are gone and we've all stopped havin' it  
No raves no more just bedside cabinet

The world carries on spinning we're mad in it  
Take that, take that

Girls who lived up the stairs  
With perfume hair that came undone

It was a very good year for blue-blooded  
Girls of independent means.  
Wed ride in limousines. their chauffeurs  
Would drive when I was thirty-five.  
  
But now the days are short, Im in the  
Autumn of the year  
And now I think of my life as vintage  
Wine from fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs. it poured  
Sweet and clear. it was a very good year.

Ain't packed

Back to back  
How d'you tell a joke, when you can't laugh  
You know that you're the punchline, baby

How you gonna live for love lying on  
Your back  
And how you gonna keep it kleen in a  
Dirty mac  
How you gonna breathe when you're lost  
In space  
You're dazed and amused  
Talking through a different face

I can't remember what I did  
Us in bed a made n' veil basement  
When you left  
Western winter  
I hear clatter  
Morning dawning  
Nothing matters  
  
When we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad you came  
  
Some of us fell by the wayside  
Others had it and threw it away  
Some caried on pretending  
They think they still have it today  
The once admired  
Look oh so tired  
Loose it on  
In the night time  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad I came  
  
Took me years to find my own song  
And for years I've thought just sing along  
But the words that were wrong  
The tune that's true lives on and on  
They'll still be here when I'm gone  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know

Shine on the lost and loneliest

You always wanted more than life  
But now you don't have the appetite  
In a message to the troubadour  
The world don't love you anymore  
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?  
  
Stuck inside the rainbow years  
You could happen to me  
Cause I've been close to where you are  
I've drove to places you have seen  
It all seems so familiar  
Like they've been sent to kill ya  
  
It doesn't take an astronaut  
To float in a space is just a thought  
The morning brings a mystery  
The evening makes it history  
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?  
  
And the village drunk  
Sadly passed away,  
It was a shame I never knew his name  
I wonder if he sat there every morning  
  
Watched the sunrise  
  
How do you rate the morning sun  
It's just too heavy for me  
And all I wanted was the world  
If you were the star let in the sun  
Don't go wasting your time  
Cause there is no finish line  
And you don't see anything,  
Not even love not anything,  
The night can take the man from you  
A sense of wonder overdue  
The morning brings a mystery  
The evening makes it history  
Who am I to rate the morning sun?

And we carried them around either with  
This long line of people  
That goes back to the beginning of time  
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people  
And we say bring together the lines of me  
  
When I look back over the years  
At the things that brought tears to my eyes  
Papa said we have to be wise  
To live long lives  
Now I recognize  
What my father said before he dies  
Vocalize things I've left unsaid  
Left my spirit unfed for too long  
I'm coming home to my family  
Where I can be strong  
Be who I planned to be  
Within me my ancestry  
Givin' me continuity  
  
Would it be remiss to continue in this way  
Would you rather I quit  
Come with that other shit  
Making people's hips sway  
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous  
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep  
Like a lifeline, I light lines  
'Cause my compassion is deep  
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep  
And this is who I happen to be  
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be

Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years  
Yeah, that's right  
My name Rob  
I'm the one  
Who landed the popstar's job  
I'm the one who  
You told look, don't touch  
I'm the kid  
Who wouldn't amount too much.  
  
I believe in the senses that I sound  
I have always been too loud  
Won't you help me drown it out?  
And When I feel  
What I'm feeling is so real  
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel  
Always digging in my heels  
Now I got the faith to  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
Water to air  
You're on your feet again  
Your feet again.  
  
Ha, lace up your booty  
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude  
Feed freakin' for loot  
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now  
And your forefathers further know how  
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred  
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread  
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best  
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth  
  
This is what my Daddy told me  
I wished he would hold me  
A little more

It's happening so....  
Often  
  
Often, I won't wake up from a dream,  
You know I love to dream  
Often, I don't stand up for what I believe,  
There's nothing left to believe  
  
So often, I make the worst decisions,  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so.... Often  
  
I often wish that you were here,  
I could moan and bend your ear  
  
Do Doo Do Doo Do Doo Do  
Yeah, Yeah  
  
Often, I don't see it when I've been wrong,  
And boy have I been wrong  
Often, I woun't need it 'till it's gone,

Is it getting better  
Or do you feel the same  
Will it make it easier on you  
Now you got someone to blame  
You say  
One love, one life  
When it's one need  
In the night  
It's one love  
We get to share it  
It leaves you baby  
If you don't care for it  
Did I disappoint you  
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth  
You act like you never had love  
And you want me to go without  
Well it's too late  
Tonight  
To drag the past out  
Into the light  
We're one  
But we're not the same  
We get to carry each other  
Carry each other  
One  
Have you come here for forgiveness  
Have you come to raise the dead  
Have you come here to play Jesus  
To the lepers in your head  
Did I ask too much  
More than a lot  
You gave me nothing  
Now it's all I got  
We're one  
But we're not the same  
We hurt each other  
Then we do it again  
You say  
Love is a temple  
Love a higher law  
Love is a temple  
Love the higher law  
You ask me to enter  
But then you make me crawl  
And I can't be holding on  
To what you got  
When all you got is hurt  
One love  
One blood  
One life  
You got to do what you should  
One life  
With each other  
Sisters, Brothers  
One life but we're not the same  
We get to carry each other  
Carry each other  
One

She said she only meant to please  
But I'm someone's brother, got a father and a mother  
You know I'm going to have to leave

To a place where you can breathe  
And you know there's no reprieve  
  
There'll be tears on leaving  
But there won't be no grieving  
'Cause a city soon forgets  
To me it's magic  
To the landlord it's tragic  
He's got another room let  
  
There'll be the same old faces in the same old places  
Where my youth was well misspent  
But I tow the line and move the time  
To a town called 'No Regrets'  
  
South of the border

To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones and

Follow your heart  
  
So she walks into this dead end bar  
Sticks her handbag on the chair  
So she walks into this dead end bar  
Puts hers handbag on the chair  
And she weights the words we shared  
When we were fifteen and still cared  
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound  
That time can't heal  
  
And I said  
Don't let your dreams out of your head  
Stick it to the man instead  
Don't fool your heart lying about  
The feelings that you had back then  
Did you try to change your life?  
Did you ever try to change your life?  
You repeat and repeat  
And repeat and repeat  
Now what's up with that?  
  
Now she loves somebody else  
In flash clothes  
She was the girl with the acid stare  
And now she'd pay to have one of those

Sing me something new

I heard somebody whisper please adore me

Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own

Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me  
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door  
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore  
  
Blue skies smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies do I see  
  
Bluebirds singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds all day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies from now on  
  
I should care if the wind blows east or west  
I should fret if the worst looks like the best  
I should mind if they say it can't be true  
I should smile, that's exactly what I do

The same old ritual, the same old dance  
The hardest thing to resist is

You're so close to shootin' that you want to burst  
Somebody's sponge needs squeezin'

Away in the distance a baby cries  
But you know somebody's by her side

The howlin' wind that just won't stop  
Somebody's cherries need pickin'

Somethings happenin' in the air

Cause all those mean old friends of mine are calling  
Calling way down the line  
Somebody send me a one way ticket  
Got to get away from here  
Put me on a jet back to London city  
Gotta get a belly full of beer  
  
Smile for the camera, please mind your manner  
You've got to keep your image clean  
Clench your fist and don't you take a piss  
Makes you want to slash your wrist  
Stand up, shut up, sit down, throw up  
All I want to do is sing  
Responsibility and fidelity  
Never meant a thing to me

Running wild  
Keep your hands off child  
Can't change me now  
I was born loose  
Running wild  
Keep your hands off me baby  
Cause you're too late, too late  
  
Big bombs are crashin'  
Never stop clashin'  
Wanting every woman in town  
Some tried to train me  
One tried to maim me  
But you can't keep a good man down  
  
Church bells ringin'  
All the kids singin'  
When we played the last date on the tour  
Janis and Jimi, can't you hear me  
Knockin' on heaven's door

Slow me down  
You can't slow me down

Wrong side of my daddy  
Wrong side of the tracks

Rod Stewart,Brighton Beach,/r/rod+stewart/brighton+beach_21059259.html,"I remember when you were only seventeen  
You were the finest girl that my eyes had ever seen  
I guess you found it hard to simply just ignore  
This scruffy beat up working class teenage troubadour  
  
So we fell in love and I tuned your heart  
With my out of tune guitar  
You were wonderful, you were mystical  
And the envy of all of my friends  
Seems like only yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach  
  
Oh what a time it was  
What a time to be alive  
Remember Janice and Jimmy  
Kennedy and King  
How they cried  
  
I sang to you the songs of Lamb and Jack  
You were Greta Garbo and I was Cadillac  
And we played so hard and we loved so hard  
Seemed we never ever slept  
There were crazy days, there were wonderful days  
And I loved you with all of my heart  
Seems like only yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach  
  
Your daddy had plans that did not include me  
And he won't stay away from your door  
And I dreamed how I dreamed I could steal you away  
To some far distant shore  
  
Then early one morning  
I awoke to find you gone  
You wrote 'I love you baby  
But it's time for me to move on'  
And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor  
I swear to God I could not have loved you anymore  
  
And as I sit here the night ,playing with my kids  
Wondering where you are in this world  
Did you find your man, are you happy now?  
Do you ever stop and think about me  
  
How I long for yesterday  
Under the stars on Brighton Beach

with one of them Walkman's on her head  
She was hot, young, beautiful  
and I said to myself  
she's destined to be mine  
  
I see her every day  
in rush hour or subway, in a grocery store  
She don't notice me  
I might as well just be a crockroach on the floor

I could've died, she looked straight through me  
But I know she's destined to be mine  
  
Every night I stand around her door and wait for her to come by  
She lives in one of those brownstones with the guard outside  
and the limousines and the Rolls Royces comin' and goin'

Bring yourself and a bottle of wine""  
So I put on my leathers  
And I tried to look my best  
But I was apprehensive  
I noticed I was the only guest  
It was then I witnessed  
Something I'd never seen  
Some satisfaction  
Dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
Listen  
  
There's a white house in Georgia  
Down the Mason-Dixon line  
They got Kentucky Derby winners there  
They got a Lear jet parked outside  
Yeah but every Friday weekend  
When the big tom cat's away  
You'll find the plantation shakin'  
By the butler and the upstairs maid  
Don't need no money, diamonds or cadillacs  
To get all the satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
  
Don't you worry  
'bout the problems of the human race  
Get some satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone baby  
Listen to this  
At a hot spot in Texas  
On an endless Friday night  
I was listenin' to Waylon and Willie  
When a cowgirl passed my sights  
And I took a look in the mirror  
To make sure that my head was screwed on  
I was feeling rejected  
But I wasn't going home  
In a moment of a rash decision  
I threw myself right on the floor  
I did a backflip and somersault  
Yeah, the crowd called for more  
So if you're tired of watching  
Being left on the shelf  
Get your satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone, dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone, dancin' alone

Oh my sweet Diana I can't wait for the manana  
There's a hotel down in Mexico just made for two  
But I don't think you trust me and I can't say I blame you  
My reputation precedes me you ain't never gonna leave me  
  
Soon as we get there I'll go check in  
Mr and Mrs Smith of Abilene  
You get naked honey I'll get down  
I'm gonna chase you around  
  
And 'round and 'round and 'round  
You say you can't stand monotony  
I say what happened to fidelity  
Dirty weekend made for two  
  
Just me and you honey  
I want to love that can last for ages  
not the trash you've been giving to strangers  
  
Don't want to make your two big brothers brothers annoyed  
Do you think you'll get the Polaroid?

The sun's shining on my back and it hurts (child)  
The FM station plays another bad 45  
And it's been so long since I had a good time  
It's been so long since I had a good time  
  
Never wrecked my head on a bandstand  
in the trombone or clarinet line  
When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras  
When those for a cryin' just stay behind in the bar  
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time  
Yeah it's been so long since I had a good time  
  
I'm gonna lose control of my powers  
I might even lose my trousers  
Smash some glass, act like trash if I want  
Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want  
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time  
This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time  
right now, show me a good time right now  
  
You better take it while you can  
You gotta get it while you can  
  
And when the Man Upstairs he calls me  
He'll say ""It's your turn son to come""  
Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me  
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street  
And tell all of my friends that I had a good time  
Open up the sky won't you ride me high  
Let's have a good time  
And if I'm late at heaven's gate blame a good time  
And when the angels sing I will join in  
Let's have a good time really  
  
I took my luck, I didn't give a fuck, I had a good time  
Tell all my friends only all my best to have a good time

Was invited by a skinny girl  
Into her high class world  
  
Left my bicycle under the stairs  
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs  
Made my way across the crowded room  
I had nothing to lose  
  
My reception wasn't very keen  
So turning on a friendly grin  
Stood on the table with my glass of gin  
And came straight to the point  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time

Dancing madly round the room, yeah  
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune  
Was escorted by a friendly slag  
'Round the bedroom and back  
  
Wandered up across to the door  
Missed my step and I fell on the floor  
Said one word and I was asked to leave  
Kinda' wish I was dead  
  
I was glad to come  
And I'll be so sad to leave  
So while I was here  
I'll had me a real good time

That she only came here for the beer  
That's the thing, oh yea

Rod Stewart,Here To Eternity,/r/rod+stewart/here+to+eternity_20117503.html,"On a hot summer's night  
In the year of '75  
Jimmy Doyle took his child bride  
Amanda, for a drive  
She was only seventeen  
He just lived to see her smile  
Their commitment to each other  
Burned like a forest fire  
Otis on the radio singing Stand By Me  
  
As a trooper pulled them over  
And said Jimmy where you been  
Someone matching your description  
Has just robbed the liquor store  
Amanda said He's been with me  
But they weren't listening anymore  
Down at Precinct Number Five  
They questioned Jimmy through the night  
The sheriff said He's gotta stand trial  
Armed robbery is the charge  
Amanda said This cannot be  
Gonna stay right here until you set him free  
And I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh God gave me something  
I must hold on to  
Gonna hold on him  
No matter what you do  
The old courthouse was crowded  
As the judge reviewed the case  
In a year of re-election  
He was desperate to impress  
Innocent or guilty  
  
He saw an opportunity  
To send Jimmy down for life  
To the Penitentiary  
Disbelief and anger  
As they dragged him away  
In a cell below the courthouse  
They beat him like a slave  
But his use of martial arts  
Struck a blow for liberty  
Felled a guard with a fist of iron  
And killed him instantly  
All the press surrounded Amanda  
Coming down the courthouse steps  
Pleading for her young man's life  
And in a moment seen by millions  
She bowed her head and cried  
Show my man some mercy  
He's the father of my child  
I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh God gave me something  
I must hold on to  
Gonna hold on him  
No matter what you do  
I love him  
Here to eternity  
Jimmy Doyle appeared again  
In a second public trail  
For the murder of a prison guard  
They sentenced him to die  
But Amanda with her long red hair  
Made one last plea  
As the court fell into silence  
She cried out desperately  
This man of mine is innocent  
As one day I shall prove  
It's an open case of self defense  
All this circumstantial evidence  
You place before your court  
Has robbed me of my husband  
Forget I will not  
I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh goodbye my Jimmy  
'Til we meet again  
In a better world than this  
I swear I'll clear your name  
'Cause I love you  
Here to eternity

I messed around with all the rules  
Apologized, then realized  
I'm not different after all  
  
Me and the boys thought we had is sussed  
Valentino's all of us  
My dad said we looked ridiculous  
But, boy, we broke some hearts  
  
In and out of jobs, running free  
Waging war with society  
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me  
But nothing ever changed  
  
Promises made in the heat of night  
Creepin' home before it got too light  
I wasted all that precious time  
And blamed it on the wine  
  
I was only joking, my dear  
Looking for a way to hide my fear  
What kind of fool was I?  
I could never win  
  
Never found a compromise  
Collected lovers like butterflies  
Illusions of that grand first prize  
Are slowly wearin' thin  
Susie, baby, you were good to me  
Giving love unselfishly  
But you took it all too seriously  
I guess it had to end  
  
I was only joking, my dear  
Looking for a way to hide my fear  
What kind of fool was I?  
I could never win  
  
Now you ask me if I'm sincere  
That's the question that I always fear  
Verse seven is never clear  
But I'll tell you what you want to hear  
I try to give you all you want  
But giving love is not my strongest point  
If that's the case, it's pointless going on  
I'd rather be alone  
  
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong  
Pouring my heart out in a song  
Owning up for prosperity  
For the whole damn world to see  
  
Quietly now while I turn a page  
Act one is over without costume change  
The principal would like to leave the stage  
The crowd don't understand

No, I haven't changed me trousers  
  
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away

Withered up my future, my life is filled with gloom

Listen, I've got to cry, 'cause crying sheds the pain  
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain

Some forever, not for better  
Some are gone and some remain

Some are dead and some are living  
In my life, I've loved them all.  
  
But of all these friends and lovers  
There is no one, compares with you  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love, as something new  
  
Though I know I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life,  
I've loved you more

I will always love you

By being someone else  
Someone that you could hold on to  
I only fooled myself  
I knew the part, but in my heart  
The role I couldn't play

That could make a woman's heart sing forgive me  
And darling if I brought you any pain  
I'm trying to explain  
  
In my heart, I was always true  
The memories of you and me  
Are written on the wind  
And sometimes, girl, I'd give the world  
To do it all again  
  
And if you need to call me  
I won't be far away  
I will always love you

Jealous

Did he alway treat you kind,  
Does he kiss you like I do,  
Did he crawl all over you,  
Did he have you on the floor,  
Were you screaming out for more,  
Is he better than I am,  
Are you seeing him again.  
  
I'm so jealous when you look at someone else,  
I'm so jealous, want you all myself,  
I'm so jealous, it's tearing me apart,  
I'm so jealous, it's ripping out my heart,

Yes I'm so jealous babe,  
I told you once before,  
I'm eatin' out my heart, baby,

I know a thing or two  
And I learned from you  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame  
It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts oh, oh love hurts  
  
Some fools think of happiness  
Blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves I guess  
They're not foolin' me

But you turned into a lover and  
Mother what a lover, you wore me out  
All you did was wreck my bed  
And in the morning kick me in the head  
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore  
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone  
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried  
  
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school  
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool  
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand

Right here in town!  
  
We'll have Manhattan  
The Bronx and Staten

It's lovely going through  
The zoo!  
  
It's very fancy  
On old Delancy  
Street you know.  
The subway charms us so  
When balmy breezes blow  
To and fro.  
  
And tell me what street  
Compares with Mott Street  
In July?  
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.  
  
The great big city's a wonderous toy  
Just made for a girl and boy.  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy!  
  
We'll go to Yonkers  
Where true love conquers  
In the whiles  
And starve together dear, in Chiles  
  
We'll go to Coney  
And eat baloney on a roll  
In Central Park we'll stroll  
Where our first kiss we stole  
Soul to soul  
  
And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say  
We both may see it close, some day  
  
The city's glamour can never spoil  
The dreams of a boy and goil  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy!

And dosciple of the streets

All the way from the U.S.A.  
Across the Atlantic far away

Would ever be the same

Is your mouth a little weak

Are you smart?  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me

Rod Stewart,No Holding Back,/r/rod+stewart/no+holding+back_20117615.html,"A friend of mine called up,  
said, ""I fin'lly had some luck-  
Could I have a minute of your time.  
I met a girl last night  
try as I might,  
I can't get her off of my mind.  
She walked in the room and right then I knew  
I fin'ly found somebody for me.  
But to tell you the truth,  
I don't know what to do.  
Should I go ahead or wait and see?""  
  
I said, ""Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Than to never love at all?""  
  
Now I'm the kind of guy  
who's normally quiet shy.  
On romance, I don't know a thing.  
But when she led me to the floor,  
never danced before.  
Suddenly my feet had wings.  
I know that she wnats me,  
I want her too,  
but I'm so confused.  
I can't think straight.  
I feel so alive,  
but on the other side,  
should I go ahead or should I wait?  
  
I said, ""Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?"".  
Than to never love at all?""  
  
So, when the music starts  
to flow from your hearts  
like the coming of an early spring,  
whe nthe river starts to flow  
between your soul to soul,  
may no man ever come between.  
Die in her arms if she wants you to.  
Be thankful for each passin' day.  
When your odds collide,  
let your spirits fly  
and pray to God it's here to stay.  
  
And I said, ""Give it all You got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
  
Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all,

His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor  
I guess he'd been there for a whole night or more  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leaving nobody to carry it on  
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
A blanket of newspaper covered his head  
The step was his pillow  
The street was his bed  
One look at his face  
showed the hard road he'd come  
and a fistful of money  
showed the coins that he'd bummed  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
Does it take much of a man  
to see a whole life go down  
To look on the world  
from a hole in the ground  
Too late for your future  
like a horse that's gone lame  
To lie in the gutter  
and die with no name  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Rod Stewart,Ooh La La,/r/rod+stewart/ooh+la+la_20117656.html,"Poor old Granddad I laughed at all his words  
I thought he was a bitter man  
He spoke of women's ways  
They'll trap you, then they use you before you even know  
For love is blind and you're far too kind  
Don't ever let it show  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger.  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger.  
  
The can-can such a pretty show  
Will steal your heart away  
But backstage back on earth again  
The dressing rooms are grey  
They come on strong and it ain't too long  
For they make you feel a man  
But love is blind and you soon will find  
You're just a boy again  
  
When you want her lips, you get her cheek  
Makes you wonder where you are  
If you want some more then she's fast asleep  
you're just twinkling with the stars.  
  
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say  
You'll have to learn, just like me  
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la  
Ooh la la, la la, yeah  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger.  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger.

Break it all down tonight  
  
In the springtime when the floods come  
And the earth bursts with the terrible life  
And the sun splash on the windows  
There's a gypsy and he's all dressed in white  
My heart burns with the question  
Can you break the spell  
Still hot as fire  
  
Can you break the spell  
Can you ring the bell  
Can you break the spell  
It's cold black as night  
Cold black as night

All that you know  
  
Down in the hole  
After diggin' the trenches  
Looking for cover and findin' out there ain't nowhere nowhere to go  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to go  
  
None of your money  
Will buy you forgiveness  
None of your jewelry  
None of your gold  
  
Your black market cigarettes  
Your American nightclubs  
Ah, they've got nowhere left  
  
Something for nothing  
All of your friends gone  
Something for nothing  
That's all that you know  
  
There's something down in the hole  
Down down down in the hole  
There's something down down down down in the hole
