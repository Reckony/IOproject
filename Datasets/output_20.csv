Sting,Natural High,/s/sting/natural+high_20285915.html,"Ooh!  
Who needs the sky?  
Just watch me fly  
I'm on a natural high  
  
We're on a natural high  
Who needs the sky?  
You can just watch me fly  
On a natural high  
So you won't turn and sigh  
And I feel like I'm 13  
  
Layin' on the sky  
Feel like I'm sailing through a fire  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Like a bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky  
Who can I tie?  
Ooh  
  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
Letting out a scream  
Like I'm sailing through a dream  
Bird I can fly on a natural high  
  
Caught in the sky (caught in the sky)  
Who can I tie? (who can I tie?)

Sting,Need Your Love So Bad,/s/sting/need+your+love+so+bad_20273427.html,"I need someone's hand to lead me through the night  
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight  
Now when the night begins I'm at an end  
Because I need your love so bad.  
  
I need some lips to feel next to mine  
I need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'  
And when the lights are low and it's time to go  
That's when I need your love so bad.  
  
So why don't you give it up and bring it home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper baby, so it can be read to me  
Tell me that you love me, and stop driving me mad  
Oh because I, I need your love so bad.  
  
I need your soft voice, to talk to me at night  
I don't want you to worry baby,  
I know we can make everything alright  
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it to me  
Because I need your love so bad.

Sting,Practical Arrangement,/s/sting/practical+arrangement_21065879.html,"Am I asking for the moon'  
Is it really so implausible'  
That you and I could soon  
Come to some kind of arrangement'  
  
I'm not asking for the moon  
I've always been a realist  
When it's really nothing more  
Than a simple rearrangement  
  
With one roof above our heads  
A warm house to return to  
We could start with separate beds  
I could sleep alone or learn to  
I'm not suggesting that we'd find  
Some earthly paradise forever  
I mean how often does that happen now  
The answer's probably never  
But we could come to an arrangement  
A practical arrangement  
And you could learn to love me  
Given time  
  
I'm not promising the moon  
I'm not promising a rainbow  
Just a practical solution  
To a solitary life  
  
I'd be a father to your boy  
A shoulder you could lean on  
How bad could it be  
To be my wife'  
  
With one roof above our heads  
A warm house to return to  
You wouldn't have to cook for me  
You wouldn't have to learn to  
I'm not suggesting that this proposition here  
Could last forever  
I've no intention of deceiving you  
You're far too clever  
But we could come to an arrangement  
A practical arrangement  
And perhaps you'd learn to love me  
Given time  
  
It may not be the romance  
That you had in mind  
But you could learn to love me  
Given time

But I'm so confident I'm sane  
It can't be an optical illusion  
So how can you explain

Outside my window pane

And those he plays never suspect  
He doesn't play for the money he wins  
He don't play for respect  
He deals the cards to find the answer  
The sacred geometry of chance  
The hidden law of a probable outcome  
The numbers lead a dance  
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  
I know that the clubs are weapons of war  
I know that diamonds mean money for this art  
But that's not the shape of my heart  
He may play the jack of diamonds  
He may lay the queen of spades  
He may conceal a king in his hand  
While the memory of it fades  
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  
I know that the clubs are weapons of war  
I know that diamonds mean money for this art  
But that's not the shape of my heart  
And if I told you that I loved you  
You'd maybe think there's something wrong  
I'm not a man of too many faces  
The mask I wear is one  
Those who speak know nothing  
And find out to their cost  
Like those who curse their luck in too many places  
And those who fear are lost  
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  
I know that the clubs are weapons of war  
I know that diamonds mean money for this art  
But that's not the shape of my heart

Sting,The Soul Cages,/s/sting/the+soul+cages_20132093.html,"The boy child is locked in the fisherman's yard  
There's a bloodless moon where the oceans die  
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets  
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie  
  
Where is the fisherman where is the goat?  
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat?  
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies  
Where is the child with his father's eyes?  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
He's the king of the ninth world  
The twisted son of the fog bells toll  
In each and every lobster cage  
A tortured human soul  
  
These are the souls of the broken factories  
The subject slaves of the broken crown  
The dead accounting of old guilty promises  
These are the souls of the broken town  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
'I have a wager' the brave child spoke  
The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke.  
'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me  
And if the drink leaves me standing,  
A soul shall go free'  
  
'I have here a cask of most magical wine  
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line  
It's wrung from the blood of the sailors who died  
Young white body adrift in the tide'  
  
'And what's in it for me my pretty young thing?  
Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings?  
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea  
You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me'

Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips  
One less soul in the soul cages  
One last curse on the fisherman's lips

Sting,The Wild Wild Sea,/s/sting/the+wild+wild+sea_20132094.html,"I saw it again this evening  
Black sail in a pale yellow sky  
And just as before in a moment  
It was gone where the grey gulls fly.  
  
If it happens again I shall worry  
That only a strange ship could fly  
And my sanity scans the horizon  
In the light of the darkening sky.  
  
That night as I walked in my slumber  
I waded into the sea strand  
And I swam with the moon and her lover  
Until I lost sight of the land  
  
I swam till the night became morning  
Black sail in a reddening sky  
Found myself on the deck of a rolling ship  
So far where no grey gulls fly  
  
All around me was silence  
As if mocking my frail human hopes  
And a question mark hung in the canvas  
For the wind that had died in the ropes  
  
I may have slept for an hour  
I may have slept for a day  
For I woke in a bed of white linen  
And the sky was the colour of clay.  
  
At first just a rustle of canvas  
And the gentlest breath on my face  
But a galloping line of white horses  
Said that soon we were in for a race  
  
The gentle sigh turned to a howling  
And the grey sky she angered to black  
And my anxious eyes searched the horizon  
With the gathering sea at my back  
  
Did I see the shade of a sailor  
On the bridge through the wheelhouse pane  
Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship  
As I squinted my eyes in the rain  
  
For the ship had turned into the wind  
Against the storm to brace  
And underneath the sailor's hat  
I saw my father's face  
  
If a prayer today is spoken  
Please offer it for me  
When the bridge to heaven is broken  
And you're lost on the wild wild sea  
Lost on the wild wild sea...

Yet you always made a profit baby  
If it was a famine or a feast  
  
Yes, I'm the soul of indiscretion,  
I was cursed with x-ray vision,  
I could see right through all the lies you told,  
When you smiled for the television  
  
And you can see the coming battle  
You pray the drums will never cease  
And you may win this war that's coming  
But would you tolerate the peace?  
  
Investing in munitions  
And those little cotton flags  
Invest in wooden caskets  
In guns and body bags, guns and body bags  
  
Your daddy was a businessman  
And it always made good sense  
You know the war can make you rich my friend  
In dollars, pounds and cents  
  
In the temple that was Mammon's  
You were ordained the parish priest  
Yes you may win this coming battle  
But could you tolerate the peace?  
  
Invest in deadly weapons

Invest in wooden caskets  
In guns and body bags

Investing in corruption  
Invest in every tyranny  
And the whole world's destruction  
  
I imagine there's a future  
When all the earthly wars are over  
You may find yourself just standing there  
On the white cliffs of Dover  
  
You may ask, what does it profit a man  
To gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?  
Is that your body you see on the rocks below  
As the tide begins to roll?  
  
And you invested in this prison  
From which you never got released  
You may have won this war we're fighting  
But would you tolerate the peace?  
  
There's a war on our democracy  
A war on our dissent  
There's a war inside religion  
And what Jesus might have meant  
  
There's a war on mother nature  
A war upon the seas  
There's a war upon the forests  
On the birds and the bees  
  
There's a war on education  
A war on information  
A war between the sexes  
And every nation  
  
A war on our compassion  
A war on understanding  
A war on love and life itself  
It's war that they're demanding  
  
Make it easy on yourself  
And don't do nothing

But someone took his place next day  
He was home by thanksgiving  
But not with the living

You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances

It'll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had

Not far enough to avoid the call

Somebody knows right where you've been

And a bit more laughter  
  
Why is that so much to ask  
More for the money  
Baby better get mine fast  
  
At the mall again  
I'm feeling desperate and uncertain  
God it's got to be here somewhere I believe  
My demographic profile  
Knows it's show time  
Raise the curtain  
Start the comedy and let me be naive  
  
A circus flea from A to be  
I jump for my keeper  
In search of true enlightenment  
For ten per cent cheaper  
  
More love for the money  
That's all I'm after  
More buzz for the honey  
And a bit more laughter  
  
Why is that so much to ask  
More for the money  
Price had better come down fast  
  
If there's a place beyond these shadows  
Of this dreary road I tread  
Then for me that's all that matters  
Just the promise of arriving  
Maybe getting there before I'm dead  
  
More love  
More love for the money  
Now keep it coming  
More buzz for the honey  
They'll all come running  
  
Put it right here in my hand  
More for the money  
Get me to the promised land  
More for the money  
Get me to the promised land

Had to get a job, had to make some money-ney  
Picked up a pen and a pad,  
Dropped reality never thinking that I would live to see the day I'd rock my

Sublime,New Song,/s/sublime/new+song_20133022.html,"I heard that payback's a mother fuckin' bitch  
But I won't stress and I won't switch  
And I would not take my life  
Glory please my God the only thing on my mind  
Takes up all of my time  
And I said ooh!  
Running from a gun  
Or some brain that ways a ton  
And my God it hurts to get so low  
Searchin' through the cars  
Cold still searchin' through the night  
I think I will run to you but I refuse to fuss and fight  
  
And God may find a reason  
Well I'm sure you'll find a rhyme  
Because it takes up nearly all my time  
He who stands for freedom  
God knows I've got the number  
But maybe I just use too much  
  
I was sitting in that bar  
Now I'm sittin' in that stolen car  
Cold, still rollin' down the boulevard  
Saw you with a gleam  
And the microphone scene  
Think I will run, to you  
But I know I won't live for me  
Cause I know God's got both, the reason and the rhyme  
Please tell me, why he takes up all my time  
I've been drinking, just like you  
And baby, you've got something I can use  
  
Payback's a mother fuckin' blast  
But I won't stress and I won't blast  
And I would not take my life  
Glory please, my God, comin' from heaven above  
Takes up all of my time  
And I said  
  
(Why must I feel like that?)  
  
Running from a gun  
And some brain that ways a ton  
You know, I did that line for Flava' Flav  
  
But, all the D.J.'s do it  
All the D.J.'s use it  
I would run, I would switch  
But I want to be the same  
And I know I'll find a reason  
Cause I always bust a rhyme  
Because it takes up nearly all my time  
The ""T"" hear stands for treason  
The ""D"" hear stands for dove  
And maybe I just use too,  
Maybe I'm just used too much  
And maybe I just use too much.

It's such a shame about it  
I used to think that it would feel so good  
But who's to blame about it  
So many creeps in Hollywood  
I'm in this dumb motel near the Taco Bell  
Without a hope in hell, I can't believe that I'm still around  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away  
  
I've had too much cryin', seen too much grief  
I'm sick of tryin' it's beyond belief  
I'm tired of talking on the telephone  
They're trying to tell me that they're not at home  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
I'm tired of walking from place to place  
I've yet to come across a friendly face  
And now the words sound familiar, as them slam the door  
'You're not what we're looking for!  
  
Ain't nothing new in my life today  
Ain't nothing true it's all gone away  
  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
If we only had time, only had time for you  
  
It was a heartbreaking  
Now I ride in the big fine car  
It was mind aching  
I'm the talk of the boulevard  
So keep your chin up boy, forget the pain  
I know you'll make it if you try again  
There's no use in quitting  
When the world is waiting for you

I don't wanna hide anymore  
  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around

Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before  
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago is green eyes and freckles  
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know, you know you know you  
  
'Cause all I know is we said hello  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
And all my walls stood tall painted blue  
But I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you  
  
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind  
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like  
  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you, know you know you  
  
'Cause all I know is we said hello  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
Come back and tell me why  
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time  
And meet me there tonight  
And let me know that it's not all in my mind  
  
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now  
I just want to know you, know you, know you  
  
'Cause all I know is we said hello  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed  
All I know is he held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
All I know is we said hello  
So dust off your highest hopes  
All I know is pouring rain  
And everything has changed  
All I know is a new found grace  
All my days, I'll know your face  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Taylor Swift,Fifteen,/t/taylor+swift/fifteen_20766168.html,"You take a deep breath  
And you walk through the doors  
It's the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile  
Try and stay out of everybody's way  
  
It's your freshman year  
And you're gonna be here for the next four years  
In this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys  
Will wink at you and say, ""you know I haven't seen you around, before""  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out  
  
Count to ten  
Take it in  
This is life before you know who you're gonna be  
At fifteen  
  
You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail  
And soon enough you're best friends  
Laughing at the other girls  
Who they think they're so cool  
We'll be out of here as soon as we can  
  
And then you're on your very first date  
And he's got a car  
And you're feeling like flying  
And you're mama's waiting up  
And you're thinking he's the one  
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
And your first kiss makes your head spin around  
  
But in your life you'll do things  
Greater than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had  
To a boy who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Don't forget to look before you fall  
  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen  
  
La la la la la  
Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

So I've got some things to say to you  
I've seen it all, so I thought

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name  
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change

I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out  
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Why I should be the one you choose  
All those other girls, well they're beautiful  
But would they write a song for you?

Lit through the darkness at 1:58  
The words that you whispered  
For just us to know  
You told me you loved me  
So why did you go  
Away  
Away  
  
I do recall now  
The smell of the rain  
Fresh on the pavement  
I ran off the plane  
That July ninth  
The beat of your heart  
It jumps through your shirt  
I can still feel your arms  
  
But now I'll go sit on the floor  
Wearing your clothes  
All that I know is  
I don't know how to be something you missed  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name, forever the name on my lips  
  
I do remember  
The swing in your step  
The life of the party, you're showing off again  
And I roll my eyes and then  
You pull me in  
I'm not much for dancing  
But for you I did  
  
Because I love your handshake  
Meetin' my father  
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets  
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something  
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions  
  
And I'll go sit on the floor  
Wearing your clothes  
All that I know is that  
I don't know how to be something you miss  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name, forever the name on my lips  
  
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep  
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe  
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are  
Hope it's nice where you are  
  
And I hope the sun shines  
And it's a beautiful day  
And something reminds you  
You wish you had stayed  
You can plan for a change in weather and time  
But I never planned on you changing your mind  
  
So I'll go sit on the floor  
Wearing your clothes  
All that I know is that  
I don't know how to be something you miss  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name, forever the name on my lips  
  
Just like our last kiss  
Forever the name on my lips  
Forever the name on my lips

That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines  
They mean so much to everyone,  
But you count them up one by one  
  
Clear midnights, and this firelight, once thinking that your dad was ten feet
tall  
A blue bonnet with rain on it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall  
Your black boots, my red flower ring  
Live for the little things  
  
Oil paintings and making every detail turn out right  
One last dance, new romance, living for that love at first sight

No fighting, black writing, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile  
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go along for the ride  
Strawberries and fairies with wings

In the back of my mind  
The time we stood with our shaking hands

We were the kings and the queens  
And they read off our names  
The night you danced like you knew our lives  
Would never be the same  
You held your head like a hero  
On a history book page  
It was the end of a decade  
But the start of an age  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day we will be remembered  
  
I said remember this feeling  
I passed the pictures around  
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines  
Wishing for right now  
We are the kings and the queens  
You traded your baseball cap for a crown  
When they gave us our trophies  
And we held them up for our town  
And the cynics were outraged  
Screaming, ""this is absurd""  
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
  
Long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life  
Fighting dragons with you  
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day we will be remembered  
  
Hold on to spinning around  
Confetti falls to the ground  
May these memories break our fall  
  
Can you take a moment  
Promise me this:  
That you'll stand by me forever  
But if God forbid fate should step in  
And force us into a goodbye  
If you have children someday  
When they point to the pictures  
Please tell them my name  
Tell them how the crowds went wild  
Tell them how I hope they shine  
  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
I had the time of my life with you  
  
Long, long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
  
Singing long live all the mountains we moved

Silence, this train runs off its tracks  
Kiss me, try to fix it, would you just try to listen  
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get it back  
  
A beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful  
What we had, a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  
We had a beautiful magic love affair  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night  
  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?

The kind of flawless I wish I could be

And the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart

It's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do'  
  
But she wears short skirts  
I wear T-shirts  
She's cheer captain  
And I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself  
Hey isn't this easy  
  
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say your fine  
I know you better then that  
Hey what you doing with a girl like that  
  
She wears high heels  
I wear sneakers  
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know  
Baby, you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh  
When you know you're about to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me about your dreams  
I think I know where you belong  
I think I know it's with me  
  
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time  
How could you not know

I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss

She said, ""not now, I'll tell you later (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you when (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you later

When it's time for you to fall in love  
It won't make sense for you to hurry  
Take you time and make up your mind

Does it matter what I do  
Is there anyone to judge?

I have journeyed through the mind  
Though I've found some different faces  
Another answer I can't find  
  
Does it matter what I do  
Is there anyone to say?  
Does it matter what I do  
Is there any other way?

As a child, so long ago

This is relationship suicide  
  
Cos if you go, I go  
  
Taking shortcuts through the alleys  
While your racing through my mind  
Cops can chase but they wont catch me  
Not before I get to speak my mind  
If there's still time  
  
Just a cigarette gone  
No you couldn't be that far  
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are  
Maybe I can talk you down  
Maybe I can talk you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
Cos if you go, I go  
  
We're standing on a tiny ledge  
Before this goes over the edge  
Gonna use my heart and not my head  
  
Just a cigarette gone  
No you couldn't be that far  
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are  
Maybe I can talk you down  
Maybe I can turn around

Askin' me for a dance

Oh and then like this gorgeous guy come up and asked me to dance.  
Well like I got so nervous I split my diet soft drink on him.  
Well that kind of bummed the evening out for us.  
And just as I was trying to dry him for off, the music started.  
Like I had never heard this type of music before.  
I had no experience with this strange beat.  
It sounded like they stole it from like the ""I Love Lucy"" show.  
And then like this guy came out.  
He was like so for sure, for sure.  
He had like wing tip shoes on and like this funny little red hat on.  
Like oh wow, that was the night Mr. Mambo changed my life.

How's the husband, and how's the kids, you know I got married too  
Lucky that you found someone who makes you feel secure  
We were all so young and foolish, now we are mature  
  
I was always so impulsive, guess that I still am  
But all that really mattered then was that I was a man  
Guess that our bein' together was never meant to be  
But, Martha, Martha, I love you, can't you see and...

By the pebbles of the highway

Through the hollow of the midnight.

With stains on my fingers,  
I run with the damned, my darling:

Drums and cannons laugh aloud  
Whistles come from ashen shroud  
Leaders damn the world and roar

Is the war behind the sky?

He might have been sober, but I brought the whiskey  
That's all between the river and me  
  
I walked up to him, and I said his name  
Just so he could see the look on my face  
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe  
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home  
He raised his fist to me, but I didn't flinch  
I said, ""I ain't your son, you son of a bitch.""

Open my eyes to the wonders you keep  
Let me look at you see how you shine  
I'll fall in love like I've done every time  
  
Lay me in soft green grass  
Down where the river runs  
Under the mountain caps  
Gold with the setting sun  
  
Walk me along the bay  
Beyond the verdant trees  
Carry me with your grace  
Forever comfort me  
  
You walk on water searching the east  
The souls of the masses pass at your feet  
Looking up at you with tears in their eyes  
Fathers of fathers of fathers gone by  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk me down old main streets  
Ride me down rusty rails  
Fields full of summer wheat  
Peppered with rounded bales  
Steeples where church bells ring  
Lighthouses by the sea  
Reach out through gathered storms  
Faithfully comfort me  
  
I am your tired I am your poor in spirit  
Yearning to breathe, breathe free  
Breathe free  
  
Lay me in soft green grass  
Down where the river runs  
Under the mountain caps

Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain  
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.  
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips.  
  
She tipped the D.J. to play her favorite song  
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong  
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on  
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it  
I don't know what it meant, but it felt good on my lips.

You can go crazy too  
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy  
I wanna go crazy with you  
  
Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is  
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips  
  
She ordered us a drink  
It was a purple kind of pink  
She said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything  
Little yellow umbrella for a fella like me  
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with  
But I took a sip

""Stranger how have you been?""  
I was caught off guard when I saw her face  
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace  
Yet somehow I managed to say ""good to see you again""  
We caught up on old friends  
Caught up on old times  
But all through the small talk, it kept burning through my mind  
  
Does she think about the nights we spent on crystal lake  
Wrapped up in a blanket 'til the break of day  
So many times I wondered does she think of me that way  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
  
Trading stories and pictures of kids  
Things we're gonna do and things never did  
'Til we were stranded in that moment not sure what to say  
Then she broke the silence with her little shy smile  
And she brought up the weather but all the while  
  
I wondered if she thinks about Jackson hole  
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow  
So many times I've wondered does she think of me that way

We said our goodbyes, swore we'd stay in touch  
Then we went our separate ways knowing, knowing no one ever does

For my next thirty years I'm gonna watch my weight  
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late  
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers  
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years  
  
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life  
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife  
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear  
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years  
In my next thirty years

Tim McGraw,My Old Friend,/t/tim+mcgraw/my+old+friend_10232140.html,"My old friend, I recall  
The times we had, hanging on my wall  
I wouldn't trade them for gold  
'Cause they laugh and they cry me  
Somehow sanctify me  
They're woven in the stories I have told, and tell again  
My old friend, I apologize  
For the years that have passed  
Since the last time you and I  
Dusted off those memories  
The running and the races  
The people and the places  
There was always somewhere else I had to be  
And time gets thin, my old friend  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
  
My old friend, this song's for you  
'Cause a few simple verses was the least that I could do  
To tell the world that you were here  
'Cause the love and the laughter  
Will live on long after  
All of the sadness and the tears  
We'll meet again  
My old friend...goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
My old friend  
My old friend  
Goodbye

Tim McGraw,Number 37405,/t/tim+mcgraw/number+37405_21052942.html,"Oh, he listens to the countdown, every Sunday morning  
From a cold solitary prison cell  
And the music from his radio is like freedom down a dirt toad  
Makes that eight by ten a brighter hill  
  
Before he started doing all the hard time that he's doing  
He was singing in them honky-tonks and dives  
He dreamed of being somebody, now he's number 37405  
  
Well she used to come and see him, every other weekend  
And bring him all the news from way back home  
It's been two birthdays since he's kissed her,  
Five seconds since he's missed her  
Now the perfume on those letters ain't that strong  
  
He's got too much time to think about the night he had too much to drink  
And all his buddies, they begged him not to drive  
Mr. Life of the Party, he's now number 37405  
  
Old judge on the bench said, ""Son, your crime's got consequences.""  
It's what he told him, fifteen years ago  
He took a life and that's a fact, he'd give his own to give it back  
Today's the day he finally gets parole  
  
He turns in them prison clothes, and stands there at the forkin' road  
And mama prays and waits while he decides  
And the angels close their eyes  
  
Listens to the birds sing on a perfect autumn morning  
Just down the road, rings an old church bell

Get used to beans and chile paste  
And learn to live and love life in the slow lane

And crawl in bed underneath the covers

Are searching for the wind  
  
I just had to call you, I had to hear your voice  
And tell you I still love you we still have a choice  
You're sewn into the fabric, the pieces of my life  
And I just can't remember why we said goodbye  
  
Everything I do  
Leads back to you  
I know I just can't let us go  
  
There must have been a reason, but I can't remember now  
I know if I could hold you we could work it out  
You're sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life  
And girl let's give it one more try  
'Cause I just can't remember why we said goodbye

Easy living when you make the rules  
Last Friday was the first time  
It only took about a half a minute  
On the stairway  
It was child's play

Cold law, steel claw  
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door

Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay

It's a see saw  
A long battle with the cold law  
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw  
  
The politicians have forgotten this place  
Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes  
No election  
They cross the line  
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime  
If they could see what's going on around here  
So many people hanging onto the edge  
Crying out for revolution  
Retribution

Sometimes I do a line, makes me laugh  
Makes me want to take a joyride  
On the high tide  
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide  
Meanwhile Eddy is on the west coast  
I know he's making out with some sweet senorita  
Up in Frisco  
You and I know

When tears are in your eyes

And friends just can't be found

I will lay me down  
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine....

I'm sailing right behind

WRITER PAUL SIMON  
The first thing I remember I was lying in my bed I couldn't of been no more
Than one or two I remember there's a radio Comin' from the room next door And
my mother laughed The way some ladies do When it's late in the evening And the
music's seeping through The next thing I remember I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right I'm with my boys I'm with my troops, yeah And down along
the avenue Some guys were shooting pool And I heard the sound Of a cappella
groups, yeah Singing late in the evening And all the girls out on the stoops,
yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J"" And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening And I blew that room away The first thing I
remember When you came into my life I said I'm gonna get that girl No matter
what I do Well I guess I'd been in love before And once or twice I been on the
floor But I never loved no one The way that I loved you And it was late in the
evening And all the music seeping through

Tom Lehrer,A Christmas Carol,/t/tom+lehrer/a+christmas+carol_20138380.html,"One very familiar type of song is the christmas carol. although it is perhaps
a bit out of season at this time. however, I'm informed by my ""disk jockey""
friends - of whom I have none,  
In order to get a song popular by christmas time, you have to start plugging
it well in advance. so here goes. it has always seemed to me after all. that
christmas, with it's spirit of giving, o  
Us all a wonderful opportunity each year to reflect on what we all most
sincerely and deeply believe in.  
I refer of course, to money. and yet none of the christmas carols that you
hear on the radio or in the street, even attempt to capture the true spirit of
christmas as we celebrate it in the unit  
Ates. that is to say the commercial spirit. so I should like to offer the
following christmas carol for next year, as being perhaps a bit more
appropriate.  
Christmas time is here, by golly,  
Disapproval would be folly,  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly,  
Fill the cup and don't say ""when.""  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens,  
Mix the punch, drag out the dickens,  
Even though the prospect sickens,  
Brother, here we go again.  
On christmas day you can't get sore,  
Your fellow man you must adore,  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four.  
Relations, sparing no expense'll  
Send some useless old utensil,  
Or a matching pen and pencil.  
""just the thing I need! how nice!""  
It doesn't matter how sincere it  
Is, nor how heartfelt the spirit,  
Sentiment will not endear it,  
What's important is the price.  
Hark the herald tribune sings,  
Advertising wondrous things.  
God rest ye merry, merchants,  
May you make the yuletide pay.  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and buy!  
So let the raucous sleigh bells jingle,  
Hail our dear old friend kris kringle,  
Driving his reindeer across the sky.  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by.  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last christmas. the nicest present I
received was a gift certificate ""good at any hospital for a lobotomy"". rather
thoughtful.

Tom Lehrer,Oedipus Rex,/t/tom+lehrer/oedipus+rex_20138385.html,"From the Bible to the popular song  
There's one theme that we find right along  
Of all ideals they hail as good  
The most sublime is motherhood  
There was a man though, who it seems  
Once carried this ideal to extremes  
He loved his mother and she loved him  
And yet his story is rather grim  
  
There once lived a man named Oedipus Rex  
You may have heard about his odd complex  
His name appears in Freud's Index 'cause he  
Loved his mother!  
His rivals used to say quite a bit that  
As a monarch he was most unfit,  
But still and all they had to admit that he  
Loved his Mother!  
  
Yes he loved his mother like no other  
His daughter was his sister  
and his son was his brother  
One thing on which you can depend is  
He sure knew who a boy's best friend is  
When he found what he had done  
He tore his eyes out one by one  
A tragic end to a loyal son who  
Loved his mother  
  
So be sweet and kind to Mother,  
Now and then have a chat  
Buy her candy or some flowers,  
Or a brand new hat  
But, maybe you had better let it go at that  
Or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex  
And  
You may end up like Oedipus  
(I'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus)  
Then end up like old Oedipus Rex!

unsanitary, nevertheless she is his because he is hers, or something like

The tune don't have to be clever,  
And it don't matter if you put a couple extra syllables into a line.  
It sounds more ethnic if it ain't good English  
And it don't even gotta rhyme... (excuse me: rhyne!)  
  
Remember the war against Franco?  
That's the kind where each of us belongs.  
Though he may have won all the battles,  
We had all the good songs!  
  
So join in the folk song army!  
Guitars are the weapons we bring  
To the fight against poverty, war, and injustice.  
Ready, aim, sing!

Tom Lehrer,The Irish Ballad,/t/tom+lehrer/the+irish+ballad_20138412.html,"Now I'd like to turn to the folk song, which has become in recent years the
particularly fashionable form of idiocy among the self-styled intellectual. we
find that people who deplore the level  
Rrent popular songs -- although I admit they do seem to be recording almost
anything these days. have you heard sesue hayakawa's record of remember pearl
harbor? these same people who deplore th  
El of current popular songs and yet will sit around enthralled singing jimmy
crack corn and I don't care or green grow the rushes, oh! -- whatever that
means. at any rate, for this elite I have  
An ancient irish ballad, which was written a few years ago, and which is
replete with all the accoutrements of this art form. in particular, it has a
sort of idiotic refrain, in this case ricket  
Kety-tin you'll notice cropping up from time to time, running through, I might
add, interminable verses. the large number of verses being a feature expressly
designed to please the true devotees  
He folk song who seem to find  
Singing fifty verses of on top of old smokey is twice as enjoyable as singing
twenty-five.  
  
This type of song also has what is known technically in music as a modal tune,
which means -- for the benefit of any layman who may have wandered in this
evening -- that I play a wrong note ever  
And then.  
[piano]  
This song though does differ strikingly from the genuine folk ballad in that
in this song the words which are supposed to rhyme - actually do.  
[piano]  
I, ah, I really should say that - I do not direct these remarks against the
vast army of folk song lovers, but merely against that peculiar hard core who
seem to equate authenticity with artisti  
It and illiteracy with charm.  
[piano]  
Oh, one more thing. one of the more important aspects of public folk singing
is audience participation, and this happens to be a good song for group
singing. so if any of you feel like joining I  
H me on this song, I'd appreciate it if you would leave -- right now.  
  
About a maid I'll sing a song,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
About a maid I'll sing a song  
Who didn't have her family long.  
Not only did she do them wrong,  
She did ev'ryone of them in, them in,  
She did ev'ryone of them in.  
  
One morning in a fit of pique,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
One morning in a fit of pique,  
She drowned her father in the creek.  
The water tasted bad for a week,  
And we had to make do with gin, with gin,  
We had to make do with gin.  
  
Her mother she could never stand,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
Her mother she cold never stand,  
And so a cyanide soup she planned.  
The mother died with a spoon in her hand,  
And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,  
Her face in a hideous grin.  
  
She set her sister's hair on fire,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
She set her sister's hair on fire,  
And as the smoke and flame rose high'are,  
Danced around the funeral pyre,  
Playin' a violin, -olin,  
Playin' a violin.  
  
She weighted her brother down with stones,  
Rickety-tickety-tin,  
She weighted her brother down with stones,  
And sent him off to davy jones.  
All they ever found were some bones,  
And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,  
Occasional pieces of skin.  
  
One day when she had nothing to do,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
One day when she had nothing to do,  
She cut her baby brother in two,  
And served him up as an irish stew,  
And invited the neighbors in, -bors in,  
Invited the neighbors in.  
  
And when at last the police came by,  
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,  
And when at last the police came by,  
Her little pranks she did not deny,  
To do so she would have had to lie,  
And lying, she knew, was a sin, a sin,  
Lying, she knew, was a sin.  
  
My tragic tale, I won't prolong,  
Rickety-tickety-tin,  
My tragic tale I won't prolong,  
And if you do not enjoy the song,  
You've yourselves to blame if it's too long,  
You should never have let me begin, begin,  
You should never have let me begin.

a Senator. From time to time you read something about him pinning a medal on
somebody or making a speech, or every now and then you read something in one

Hubert Humphrey and so on.  
  
This became quite an issue last winter at the time of Winston Churchill's
funeral, when President Johnson was too ill to go and somebody suggested that
he send Hubert and he said, ""Hubert Who?"" ...and all America was singing:  
  
Whatever became of Hubert?  
Has anyone heard a thing?  
Once he shone on his own,  
Now he sits home alone  
And waits for the phone to ring.  
  
Once a fiery liberal spirit,  
Ah, but now when he speaks, he must clear it.  
Second fiddle's a hard part, I know,  
When they don't even give you a bow.  
  
""We must protest this treatment, Hubert"",  
Says each newspaper reader.  
As someone once remarked to Schubert,  
""Take us to your Lieder""...  
(Sorry about that.)  
  
Whatever became of you, Hubert?  
We miss you, so tell us, please:  
Are you sad? Are you cross?  
Are you gathering moss  
While you wait for the boss to sneeze?  
  
Does Lyndon, recalling when he was VP,  
Say ""I'll do unto you like they did unto me""?  
Do you dream about staging a coup?

Lived Linda Bohannon, a natural queen  
She lived with her folks in a little white farmhouse  
She helped out by hoeing the corn and the beans  
Sometimes she would stare at herself in a mirror  
And any would say, there was much to admire  
Every turn of the curve of her body was flawless  
From pretty white teeth to her shiny blond hair  
One day, as she stood by the road leading westward  
In blue jeans and t-shirt and mail-order boots  
The tractors and trailers and pick-ups, saw Linda  
The drivers all slowed down to holler and hoot  
They received, not a smile from miss Linda Bohannon  
No bag and no brush did she hold in her hand  
Just Linda Bohannon, a physical treasure  
Stepped into a light-blue Mercedes Benz  
And this is one of those times  
That we wish we knew the missing parts to these stories  
But this is all we know  
She was missing a week and her parents were worried  
She called Sunday morning and said, ""I'm okay""  
Well, Bohannons don't talk much, but we found out later  
She called from a movie star's house in L.A  
She's home now and been here for six years or seven  
She brought home a baby, a fine-looking lad  
Well Bohannons don't talk much, and Linda don't either  
And nobody told us a thing about his dad  
Well she's pretty as ever and she works in a gift shop  
Looks after her boy and she don't ask for help  
She watches the re-runs of an old TV western  
And the boy looks a lot like a re-run himself

A little while and I'd be on my way back home to you  
While I was waitin' for my flight, got out and looked around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
I met some entertainers and they had an extra girl  
I told them I was just a tourist out to see the world  
From one place to another, yes we really made the rounds  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Next day they all took me in just like they did before  
I guess I'm trying to tell you I won't be home anymore  
Now this may sound poetic, but I'm happy as a clown  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Remember how I used to sit and drink and play guitar  
And I'd get up and sing for all those folks at jody's bar  
Well I found out it ain't too bad, the way I pick and sound  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You know that nest egg that we buried in the bank awhile  
Take it out and spend it darlin', dress yourself in style  
You have always been a swinger and now I won't be around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
I've got myself a little shack out on ol' hickory lake  
And now and then I get a gig and buy myself a steak  
Why'know, they published one of my old songs, they're showing it around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You remember all those tranquilizers that I used to take  
Well I'm not on those anymore, I'm on old hickory lake

Tom T. Hall,Ode To A Half A Pound Of Ground Round,/t/tom+t+hall/ode+to+half+a+pound+of+ground+round_20190008.html,"This is the song about the time I nearly starved to death in Roanoke Virginia  
I woke up Wednesday morning in my little motel bed  
Knowing I would die the minute that I move my head  
I felt around to make sure I was in my bed alone  
I meet some friendly people when I'm stoned  
My payday was on Friday I had two more days to go  
Even in my agony I knew that I was broke  
Lemme pay the check I said and keep the change my friend  
She wiggled out of sight with my last ten  
At noon I realized there wasn't any way to eat  
For lunch I just went out and shuffled up and down the street  
At four o'clock I had a funny feeling in my chest  
How long's it take to starve a man to death  
I found some pennies in my junk and bought a candy bar  
Divided it in pieces and I ate one every hour  
I just rolled into town and didn't know a single soul  
There wasn't any way to make a loan  
[ dobro ]  
Thursday morning I was nearly panicked on the job  
I heard my stomach growlin' and my head began to throb  
I contemplated murder of the folks that brought their lunch  
The sudden smell of food would make me jump  
Thursday night they run all food commercials on TV  
I slept till nine or ten and then I walked the floor to three  
Friday morning I looked for some ketchup on my shirts  
My mind was gone my legs began to hurt  
The last few minutes up to payin' time were all the worst  
The minutes were the years it took to build the universe  
Finally it came I got my check and made a dash yes I said the man will eat at
last  
Running down the sidewalk I could see the words so sweet  
The sign was flashin' on and on Eat Eat Eat  
A half o'pound of ground round ma'm and please don't cook it long  
The frizzle of the grill was like a song  
I've traveled this world over and I ain't been hungry much  
I've been down in my thinking and I've been down on my luck  
But the sweetest meal I've ever had in anybody's town  
Was a half a pound of plain ground round ground round

When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge  
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me  
The guy who ran the bar was watching Iron sides on TV  
Uninvited he sat down and opened up his mind  
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
Ever had a drink of watermelon wine he asked  
He told me all about it though I didn't answer back  
Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime  
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
  
He said women think about they selves when menfolk ain't around  
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down  
He said I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime  
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine  
Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes  
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate  
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line  
Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Considerable disadvantage among the more fluent)  
Although she couldn't write or couldn't talk,  
Ramona really had a pretty walk. (a four letter figure)

She couldn't speak. Her mom was going wild.  
Confusion reigned for half a day as one could understand.  
The county judge came down to lend a hand. (and I think it should be noted in  
The interest of justice that the judge was acting in a strictly unofficial
Capacity)

Then closed one eye and (puh-tui) spat upon the ground.

In a boat on a plane in a train in a house by the phone  
(Hey there) we're all in this thing alone  
You can't smile for me I can't cry for you we can't be alone together that
makes two  
Like trees that fall in forest no one hears crying done alone don't call for
tears  
(Hey there) you know she left me...  
  
Ain't it strange how we think money knows when Friday comes  
Calls don't know bout Sunday and our heartaches twice as done  
It hurts although it's killed you thorugh and through  
My eyes all red from tears aren't really blue

I sold opium, fireworks and lead  
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers  
When the shadows get long I'll be dead  
  
Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar  
Skin was as white as a cuttlefish bone  
I left Texas to follow Lucinda  
Now I'll never see heaven or home  
  
I made a wish on silver of moonlight  
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars  
Like a kid who captures a firefly  
And leaves it only to die in the jar  
  
As I kick at the clounds at my hanging  
As I swing out over the crowd  
I will search every face for Lucinda's  
And she will off with me down to hell  
  
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda  
The rain returned and so did the wind  
I cast this burden on the god that's within me  
I leave this old world and go free  
  
The devil dances inside empty pockets  
But she never wanted money or pearls  
No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda  
She wasn't that kind of girl  
  
Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda  
Whoever thought that hell would be so cold  
I did well for an old tin can sailor  
But she wanted the bell in my soul  
  
I've spoken to God on the mountain  
And I've swam in the Irish sea  
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges  
And I'll beg there for mercy for me  
  
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda  
The rain returned and so did the wind  
I was standing outside the Whitehorse  
Oh but I was afraid to go in  
  
I heard someone pull the trigger  
Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again  
There was a smear of gold in the window  
And then I was the jewel of her sin  
  
They call me William The Pleaser  
I sold opium, fireworks and lead  
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers  
When the shadows get long I'll be dead

green knoll, outside of town by  
the train tracks and a seagull dump  
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel  
and her 'Marvellous Pigs In Satin'  
  
We pounded our stakes in the ground  
All powder brown  
And the branches spread like scary  
fingers reaching  
We were in a pasture outside Kankakee  
  
And One Eyed Myra, the queen of  
the galley who trained the  
ostrich and the camels  
She looked at me squinty with her  
one good eye in a Roy Orbison  
T-shirt as she bottle fed  
an orangutan named Tripod  
  
And then there was  
Yodeling Elaine the  
queen of the air who wore a  
dollar sign medallion and she  
had a tiny bubble of spittle  
around her nostril and a  
little rusty tear, for she had  
lassoed and lost another  
tipsy sailor  
  
And over in  
the burnt yellow tent  
by the frozen tractor, the  
music was like electric sugar  
And Zuzu Bolin played  
'Stavin' Chain' and Mighty  
Tiny on the saw and he  
threw his head back with a  
mouth full of gold teeth  
And they played 'Lopsided heart'  
And 'Moon over Dog Street'  
  
And by the time they played 'Moanin Low'  
I was soakin' wet and wild eyed  
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a  
preparation and I fell asleep with  
'Livery Stable Blues' in my ear  
  
And me and Molley Hoey drank  
Pruno and Koolaid and she had a  
tattoo gun made out of a cassette  
motor and a guitar string and  
she soaked a hanky in 3 Roses  
and rubbed it on the spot  
and drew a rickety heart and  
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell  
  
And Funeral Wells spun  
Poodle Murphy on the target  
as he threw his hardware,  
Only once in Sheboygan did he miss  
at a matinee on Diamond Pier and  
she'd never let him forget it  
  
They were doing two shows and she  
had a high fever and he took  
off a piece of her ear and  
Tip Little told her she should  
leave the bum  
but Poodle said, ""He fetched me  
last time I run.""  
But I'd like to hammer this ring into a bullet  
And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun

Things are tough all over  
When the thunder storms start  
Increasing over the southeast  
And south central portions  
Of my apartment, I get upset  
And a line of thunderstorms was

Disconcerted precarious emotional

There was no severe weather well  
Into the afternoon, except for a lone gust of  
Wind in the bedroom  
In a high pressure zone, covering the eastern

With a hundred and three and millibar high pressure zone

Tom Waits,Foreign Affair,/t/tom+waits/foreign+affair_20138835.html,"When traveling abroad in the continental style,  
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet,  
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position  
Allows you a perspective that's unique  
  
And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse,  
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down  
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content  
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town  
  
Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit  
That remains the object of their long relentless quest  
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending  
The pursuit, you see, and never the arrest  
  
Without fear of contradiction, bon voyage is always hollered  
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore,  
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned  
That she won't see him anymore  
  
Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically  
Evoke a common attitude of blue  
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport  
And the cargo that they're carrying is you  
  
A foreign affair, juxtaposed with a stateside  
And domestically approved romantic fancy,  
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances,  
Knowing it will only be parlayed into a memory

Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine,  
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine  
  
I can't wait to get off work and see my baby  
She'll be waiting up with a magazine for me.  
Clean the bathrooms and clean 'em good, oh your loving I wish you would  
Come down here and sweep a-me off my feet, this broom'll have to be my baby,  
If I hurry, I just might get off before the dawn's early light.

'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,  
Well the music plays and you display  
Your heart for me to see,  
I had a beer and now I hear you  
Calling out for me  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
Well the room is crowded, people everywhere  
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?  
Well if you sit down with this old clown,  
Take that frown and break it,  
Before the evening's gone away,  
I think that we could make it,  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
Well the night does funny things inside a man  
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
You light a cigarette,  
I wish I had the guts to bum one,  
But we've never met,  
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.  
  
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,  
And it being late, you'd like some some company,  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
And you look back at me,  
The guy you're with has up and split,  
The chair next to you's free,  
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.  
  
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out  
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.  
Well I turn around to look at you,  
You're nowhere to be found,  
I search the place for your lost face,  
Guess I'll have another round  
And I think that I just fell in love with you.

Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors  
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,  
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues  
  
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth  
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore  
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle  
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue  
  
She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?,  
You say 'anyway's the only way', be careful not to gamble  
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here  
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes  
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues  
  
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,  
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers  
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey  
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind  
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze  
And an open invitation to the blues  
  
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,  
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things  
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,  
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared  
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes  
And left her with an invitation to the blues  
  
Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening  
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while  
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,  
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?  
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose,  
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues

But the hangman isn't hangin'  
And they put you on the street

Well you know she's no high climber  
Then you find your only friend  
In a room with your two-timer  
And you're sure you're at the end  
Then you love a little wild one  
But she brings you only sorrow  
All the time you know she's smilin'  
You'll be on your knees tomorrow

That you're not a gambling man  
Then you find you're back in Vegas  
With a handle in your hand  
Your black cards will make you money  
So you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey  
You must put them on the table

Circling pictures of you  
  
The time you sailed on  
Under the diamond eye  
Or for a dolphin who for a song had  
Crossed night  
To bring back your bride  
  
Under a warm Tuscan sun  
No cliff was too steep for us  
Here at the edge of the moon  
I surf a curve thrown by you  
  
And did you teach me to fly  
Past your marmalade sky  
So that after the waning and waxing of love  
You could find  
Me at the edge  
Here at the edge  
Me at the edge of  
The edge of the moon  
  
Now I'm going back  
Past that marmalade sky  
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert  
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

She said that you gave it to her  
That night that you planned to go clear  
Did you ever go clear?  
  
Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older  
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder  
You'd been to the station to meet every train  
And you came home without Lilly Marlene  
  
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life  
And when she came back she was nobody's wife  
  
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth  
One more thin gypsy thief  
Well I see Jane's awake  
  
She sends her regards  
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer  
What can I possibly say?  
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you  
I'm glad you stood in my way  
  
If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me  
Your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free

Job's coffin looks down  
  
To see what mankind  
Is gonna do  
  
There is a grid  
Of  
Disempowerment  
  
All forces  
Are being called  
To dismantle this  
  
As Job's coffin looks down  
Job's coffin looks down  
  
To see  
What you're gonna do  
  
There exists  
A power of old  
Who wanted earth  
To be controlled  
  
But She  
And She alone  
Is her own  
  
She is her own  
  
Job's coffin looks down  
Job's coffin looks down  
  
I can't be proud,  
Proud of what I have done  
  
Since time  
Why do we women  
Give ourselves away?  
  
We give ourselves away  
Thinking somehow  
That will make him  
Want to stay  
  
Make him stay  
  
Job's coffin looks down  
At the day you  
Shut your power down  
  
You must uncreate  
That  
Destructive tendency  
  
Let your fire  
Start to  
Heal the fury  
Sister its time  
To bring it  
Back online  
  
As Job's coffin looks down  
Job's coffin looks down  
  
To see what you're gonna do  
To see what you're gonna do

Tori Amos,Josephine,/t/tori+amos/josephine_20139542.html,"Not tonight josephine.  
In an army's strength therein  
Lies the denouement. From  
Here you're haunting me. By  
The Seine so beautiful, only  
Not to be of use, impossible.  
So strange, victory, 1200 spires  
The only sound, moscow burning.  
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream  
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible.  
In the last extremity, to  
Advance or not to advance, I  
Hear you laughing  
Even still you're calling me  
""not tonight, not tonight  
Not tonight""

Tori Amos,Lady In Blue,/t/tori+amos/lady+in+blue_20791605.html,"I said how could I write so great beautiful songs  
Someone now thinks Caton wrote them all  
Now I like to speak just about silly things I said  
So today, the smurfs again  
How can they be so blue, so short, so sweet  
Smurf, you're like me we're three apples tall at least  
But if you ask me why  
I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
But maybe that's the new concept  
Where the smurfs are like the bees in the garden now  
They live in mushrooms, the new sin symbols  
And where the smurfette's forced to sell her  
But how  
Said how  
  
They forced you to submit your soul  
Poor lady in blue she sings  
  
Small shy, oh my oh my  
Won't even try  
To make something out of himself  
And if you look, please smile  
He'll run a mile  
The poor little, silly shy smurf  
  
The smurfette is the Mary Magdalene  
Gargamel is the Bush America  
And if you ask me why  
I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
And so in my new concept  
The smurfette is risen as feminine  
The smurfs are the archetype  
Of what societies could be  
And I'd like to live in mushrooms  
I'll come with you little silly smurfs  
Smurfette don't be worried  
Of being the only woman now  
  
I'll be with you in these dark nights  
When they'll try to submit you  
Poor lady in blue  
We'll be together

Well, I've been afraid of changing

They got her armed as they buy and sell her  
Rivers of milk running dry

What'll we do when our babies scream  
Fill their mouths with some acid rain

And I know what this means  
Me and Jesus a few years back  
Used to hang and he said  
""It's your choice babe, just remember  
I don't think you'll be back in three days' time so you choose well""

Is it my right to be on my stomack of Fred's Seville  
And do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet  
These things go through your head when there's a man on your back  
And you're pushed flat on your stomach  
It's not a classic Cadillac

Reach out  
Someone reach out to me  
Cause I've lost my way  
Sometimes we  
Give into things, when we lie and cheat,  
Say things  
My life's crumbling down  
Time for me to pray  
Hold me in  
Deep inside, cause I'm dying,  
I'm just dying, I'm just dying

You're the one who must surrender  
I think they call it responsibility  
I'm a man in emotion  
With only one compulsion  
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart  
I'm not looking for a fight  
No one's wrong and no one's right  
Maybe we all need time apart

You see an angel and she takes you by the hand  
We're walking through mindfields

On the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
I kept searching through the ally  
Searching through the catacombs that night  
I closed my eyes and threw a coin in the fountain  
Then I looked and she was nowhere in sight  
I wandered through the holy city  
Like a beggar beneath the moon lit dome  
Near the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
I heard a voice as I looked through my fingers  
And saw the old monsignor  
He gave me his blessing and said  
""Don't try and please her""  
And then I heard her singing like some diva  
Parched upon her throne  
On the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
Now I know I should have listened  
When he warned me not to follow  
I noticed that the statue's eyes  
Were all sunken and hollow  
She let hose young wolves do the dirty deeds  
While she lay there inside her home  
On the Spanish steps of Rome

We sail in dark waters, Lord give me some peace of mind  
Temptation before me, ahead lies the tower of truth that I must find  
To you I will climb  
Till I leave this cruel world far behind, always know that

Toto,Without Your Love,/t/toto/without+your+love_20139695.html,"It's late at night, nothin's feelin' right  
Since you've gone away  
I think I know why you left this time,  
But it's still hard to say  
I nearly lost it, when he came around you  
Now I'm holdin' it all inside and it's killin' me  
  
We used to meet at an old cafe in Chi-Town  
At first you could hear the wind stop,  
Then my heart would pound  
I remember everything you used to do, girl  
Now I'm learning something that you already knew  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not the same without your love  
Every night and every day, girl  
It's not the same without your love  
You don't have to be afraid  
It's not the same without your love  
Every night and every day, girl  
It's not the same without your love  
  
I see you through the door, with your motor runnin'  
I can still hear the sound  
I knew then, when you asked him in, you let your guard down  
You're talking soft, don't tell me,  
I know you're sincere  
I just called to tell you I'm the only one here

Toto,You Are The Flower,/t/toto/you+are+the+flower_20139737.html,"You never lose a minute, if in it there is love  
And ""old man time"" always pulls you through  
It's better not to depend on the morning dew  
For the rose you plant in your bed tends to you, hard and blue  
  
Some folks take money, some take their life, some take forever to see  
Blind faith, blind love, they're no mystery to me  
You must take the time, for that's the fee

It's worth the pain that makes the tears  
It's worth the light of a million years  
Only your love I can't explain, you are the flower for my rain  
  
You light the sun that shines from my eyes  
It's all in return for what you're giving me  
You are the reason for the earth beneath my feet  
And you kill the space that I call free  
  
You are the flower for my rain, you are the flower for my rain  
You are the flower for my rain, you are the flower for my rain  
You are the flower for my rain, you are the flower for my rain

Please keep me true sane  
Until I reach home on the morrow  
Never never to wander again  
I'm weak and I'm weary of sorrow  
  
London to Dublin  
Australia to Perth  
I gazed at your sky  
I tasted your earth  
Sung out my heart  
For what it was worth  
Never again shall I ramble  
  
There's nowhere left  
In this world where to go  
My arms, my legs they're a-tremblin'  
Thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky  
Not even worth the rememberin'  
  
Now as I stumble  
And reel to my bed  
All that I've done  
All that I've said  
Means nothin' to me  
I'd soon as be dead  
All of this world be forgotten  
  
No words of comfort  
No words of advice  
Nothin' to offer a stranger  
Gone the love, gone the spite  
It just doesn't matter no longer  
  
My sky's getting far  
The ground's gettin' close  
My self goin' crazy  
The way that it does  
I'll lie on my pillow  
And sleep if I must  
Too late to wish I'd been stronger  
Too late to wish I'd been stronger

Because they're too blind to know

Your diamonds had glitter, but now it's all gone  
It poisoned your laughter and muffled your singing  
You can't even see that it's wrong

Your carpets are faded, your walls are all gray  
There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal

And I'll make my bed on a hill 'neath the sky  
And lay here a-listening till the sun comes tomorrow  
Counting the tears that you cry

Townes Van Zandt,"Billy, Boney And Ma",/t/townes+van+zandt/billy+boney+ma_20139935.html,"Well, Billy went down to the battleground  
To find a little trinket he could call his own  
Didn't see nothin' lying around  
He decided he'd dig awhile  
Well he dug her up and he dug her down  
'Fore too long he found some bones  
Poor little Billy couldn't make a sound  
When the bones sat up and smiled  
  
Oh Billy you seem like a fine young man  
No reason to be a tremblin' soul  
Come over here and shake my hand  
Make my proud acquaintance  
Well Billy he was stunned he could hardly stand  
Whether he could move he didn't know  
But he knew he had to formulate some kinda plan  
Or try the boneman's patience  
  
The first thing he wanted to do was breathe  
So he gulped in some of that battleground air  
Next thing he wanted to do was leave  
But Billy wasn't raised up rude  
Well the boneman grunted and he gave a heave  
All of a sudden he was loomin' there  
Shakin' off dirt and actin' pleased  
Things didn't look too good  
  
Well Billy decided what the hell  
You don't meet a boneman every day  
A little bit skinny but you never can tell  
He might be a pretty good guy  
Well they started off with the old soft sell  
'Fore too long they were jawin' away  
By the time the darkness fell  
They were seein' socket to eye  
  
They decided right then on a life of crime  
With the boneman's looks and Billy's brains  
They could scare old Scrooge out of his last dime  
Might as well have a go  
Billy he would picked the place and time  
From the corner store to the railroad train  
Boney'd flash him a smile sublime  
And Billy he'd grab the dough  
  
They decided they might as well start right then  
Time's awastin' so they say  
They headed for the park  
Where the lights are dim  
And only the foolish tread  
He was whistlin' a tune  
When they spotted him strollin' along  
So plump and gay  
Boney gave him a great big grin  
And Billy snagged his bread  
  
Next come a lady of the night  
Boney saddled up and said hello  
Gave the poor thing such a terrible fright  
She fainted dead away  
Billy lifted her purse and her earrings bright  
Diamond rings and watch you know  
Couldn't figure out try as they might  
Why they'd ever worked a single day  
  
Billy's plans ended up in ruin you know  
They were workin' a quaint little neighborhood  
Spied an old lady about eighty or so  
Almost looked too easy  
Boney put on a pretty good show  
The little ol' lady didn't see too good  
My kind Sir your all bones you know  
You need something hot and greasy  
  
Grabbed ol' Boney drug him inside  
Billy peeked in through the window sill  
She fed him boiled and baked and fried  
Ol' Boney he's chewin like crazy  
He gobbled up everything he tried  
Pounds added on like you know they will  
Billy laid down in the dirt and cried  
Watchin Boney Gettin fat and lazy  
  
Well Billy's back workin his job by day  
Sleep'n nights it ain't so bad  
Never liked stealin anyway  
Kinda gives a guy the willies  
Boney and Ma got a new cafe  
Best baked beans you ever had  
Ma's expecting any day  
And they say they're gonna name him Billy

Has convinced himself that he understands  
I wish him well, Miss Carousel

You're sure that you don't need me then

Is worth so much it can't be sold  
No time to weep she'll need her sleep  
Tomorrow  
When she carries her face to the market place  
And bets it on the opening race  
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel,  
But her singing brings me sorrow  
  
It's always done every mother's son  
Is shown that grown men never run  
And so they fight with all the might  
Inside them  
When the battle's been fought and they all been taught  
That the trick is just not being caught  
Will you give them hell, Miss Carousel,  
When they're begging you to hide them  
  
When the need arose your eyes fell closed  
You clamped your fingers round your nose  
Would you say that's any way  
To judge him  
You haven't got the authority  
To kill him in the first degree  
But would you feel compelled, Miss Carousel,  
If you have something to begrudge him  
  
On a velvet beach far beneath the reach  
Of those that come to pray and preach  
The natural man who tries to stand  
Is fallin  
How long will it be before he sees  
You own his legs but his mind is free  
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel,  
How long will he be crawling?

Seem there ain't no hope at all  
To reach the top even though you stop  
For breathin'

Could I count on you  
To lay me down?

Thinking I never got close enough to stay  
Time runs in, and then runs out  
Starts again and it's always been that way  
You're gonna drown tomorrow  
If you cry to many tears for yesterday  
Tomorrow's half of all you've got  
So treat him good, 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay  
  
I won't be forgetting you  
You won't be forgetting me, I know  
If memory comes a summer cloud  
Rains her sweetness down to me below  
I see you like you look right now  
Maybe wonder why I had to go  
But heaven is the way she is  
Rain falls and rivers flow  
  
So here's to feelin' good  
Here's to feelin' bad  
Here's to bein' thankful  
Sorry for the pleasures that we had  
And autumn days and window panes  
God, forgive us if you feel deceived  
The clock don't know you like I do  
And it's only him or me you got to believe

She'll lead you down through misery  
Leave you low, come time to go  
Alone and low as low can be  
  
If I had a nickel I'd find a game  
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain  
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry  
And lay me down dissatisfied  
  
Legs to walk and thoughts to fly  
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry  
A restless tongue to classify  
All born to grow and grown to die  
  
So tell my baby I said so long  
Tell my mother I did no wrong  
Tell my brother to watch his own  
And tell my friends to mourn me none  
  
I'm chained upon the face of time  
Feelin' full of foolish rhyme  
There ain't no dark till something shines  
I'm bound to leave this dark behind  
  
Ride the blue wind high and free  
She'll lead you down through misery  
Leave you low, come time to go

Fairest skin with eyes of blue  
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true  
It's a year now she's been gone  
  
Her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine  
Lips the color of strawberry wine  
I wish to God she still was mine  
The chance won't come again  
  
After first we lay in love's sweet bed  
With one look at her eyes I might have read  
All the pain that was flying through her head  
Through my guilt I could not see  
  
I turned to her when the morning came  
Hungry thoughts racing through my brain  
But the knife in her heart screamed herself she'd slain  
And a note whispered love too soon  
  
Her old man screamed and her mother cried  
All I could do was to wonder why  
A girl in her youth was forced to die  
Is loving such a crime?  
  
She died (few in the years) with breasts still small  
Seeing sixteens summers and fifteen falls  
Me and my blindness never realized all  
The fear she kept inside  
  
Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew  
Fairest skin with eyes of blue  
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true

Was when a friend of mine said ""Man, let's get some Thunderbird""  
I said ""What's that?"" he just started to grin  
Slobbered on his shirt, his eyes got dim  
He said ""You got fifty-nine cents?""  
  
I said ""Yeah, I got a dollar, but don't be a smartalec  
I ain't gonna spend it on no Indian relic""  
And he said ""Thunderbird's not an old Indian trinket,  
It's a wine, man, you take it home and drink it.""  
I said ""It sure don't sound like wine to me""  
And he said he'd bet me the change from my dollar  
  
We hustled on down to the nearest you-Tate-Um  
The guy wanted my ID, I whipped her out and showed him  
He got a green bottle from the freezing vault  
My friend started doing backward somersaults  
Through the cottage cheese  
  
Took it back to his house, started drinkin'  
Pretty soon I set in to thinkin'  
""Man, this Thunderbird tastes yummy, yummy, yummy  
And I know it's doing good things to my tummy, tum, t""  
It's so you reason when your on that crap  
  
Got a few more bottles, chugged them down  
I pulled myself up off the ground  
Decided I go see my dearest sweet wife  
Who met me at the door with a carving knife  
Said ""Get them damn grape peel from between your teeth.""  
  
I could see we're gonna have a little misunderstanding  
I said ""Dear, I better get in touch with you later""  
She said ""Forget it, man, you're never touchin' me again!""  
  
Now I've seen the light and heard the word  
And I'm staying away from that ol' dirty Thunderbird  
A message come from heaven radiant, and fine,  
All I drink now is communion wine  
Six days a week

Townes Van Zandt,The Hole,/t/townes+van+zandt/the+hole_20139947.html,"The old woman finally caught me  
Sneakin' 'round her cave  
Her hair looked just like barbwire, boys  
And her smile just like the grave  
She asked me could I stay awhile  
I said I'd better go  
She slid her arm around my neck  
And sweetly whispered no  
  
It's cold and dark and lonely here  
As soon enough you'll see  
I'm oh so glad you stumbled in  
I've been cravin' company  
I cannot stay too long you know  
I left some friends at home  
Don't you fret about your friends  
Down here we're all alone  
  
What about my mother  
I can't just leave her there to mourn  
You don't have to think about her  
Just forget you were ever born  
I'll disappoint my father  
You know he worked so hard for me  
If you have to pay your father back  
Just send him some misery  
  
I'll miss, I said, a girl I know  
I can't just leave there to pine  
She's still got plenty of men to go  
I'm sure she'll do just fine  
What about my little boy  
She said, he's just like you  
Let a few short years roll by  
He'll end up down here too  
  
Then her pale green eyes began to glow  
She placed her hand on mine  
She smiled and said don't worry  
You'll get used to me in time  
As her cold tongue flickered toward  
I spun myself around  
Made a dive for the passageway  
But the walls come crashing down  
  
Now her eyes were the only light  
My fevered brain could see  
But I tore myself away from them  
And fell down to my knees  
I've come too far, I can't get back  
I beseeched the Gods of men  
Fame and fortune just laughed at me  
Then silence once again  
  
A whisper deep within  
Embrace the God of Love  
I lifted my face and through the tears  
I saw light fall from above  
  
I hurled myself into the wall  
I ripped and clawed my way  
Through the stinkin', clingin' loam  
Back to the light of day  
I crawled out into the wind again  
The sky upon my face  
I heard the earth sigh patiently  
As it slid back into place  
  
Now I'm back among the ones I love  
I'm loved by them in turn  
And it's only on the darkest night  
That green eyed memory burns  
So walk my friends, in the light of day  
Don't go sneakin' 'round no holes  
There just might be something down there  
Wants to gobble up your soul

He's always been that way.  
  
Jolly Jane just lays around  
And listens with her mouth  
She's had about a dozen husbands  
But the last one pulled out

Of lonely laughter blindly thrown

And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The hall is filled to every corner  
By a tinkling hint of chimes  
A melody careens and crumbles  
Leaving just a trace behind  
A rhythm [palter and] faintly fails  
The silver on its wings  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The cymbals flash, the drums they crash  
The trumpets rise the song  
The brass beton plucks its diamonds  
From a glittering wall of almost dawn  
The crystal chords they slash the wind  
In humble majesty  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing

Make you cry

Take turns to push and pull you down  
Forget trying to live and be happy

Tracy Chapman,Broken,/t/tracy+chapman/broken_20159754.html,"You can close your eyes  
And see a picture perfect life  
Inside of your mind  
Dreaming only of the days ahead  
Wanted and wished for more than now  
Or the days behind  
You waste your time  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
You can never think  
You can't even stop yourself  
Before the words have been spoken  
And you've already said  
You would give everything  
And something for nothing  
Everybody thinks you're joking  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
You want to be the one  
Made over be your own  
Before and after  
And a supermarket  
Beauty in a bottle queen  
Who'll one day grace a check-out counter  
Magazine front cover  
Though the fine print reads  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Broken  
Broken  
  
When your life is never what you wanted  
Not even halfway normal  
Just tarnished and soiled  
When in your reach  
A framed and frozen moment  
So far from perfection  
Not truth or transcendence  
Will set you free  
Still you don't believe  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broke

If you saw the face of God and Love  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you knew that love can break your heart  
When you're down so low you cannot fall  
Would you change?  
Would you change?

How bad how good does it need to get?  
How many losses how much regret?  
What chain reaction  
What cause and effect  
Makes you turn around  
Makes you try to explain  
Makes you forgive and forget  
Makes you change  
Makes you change  
  
If you knew that you would be alone  
Knowing right being wrong  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you knew that you would find a truth  
That brings a pain that can't be soothed  
Would you change?  
Would you change?

Are you so upright you can't be bent  
if it comes to blows  
Are you so sure you won't be crawling  
If not for the good why risk falling  
Why risk falling  
  
If everything you think you know  
Makes your life unbearable  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you'd broken every rule and vow  
And hard times come to bring you down  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
  
If you knew that you would die today  
If you saw the face of God and Love  
Would you change?  
Would you change?

Tracy Chapman,Cold Feet,/t/tracy+chapman/cold+feet_20140258.html,"There was a little boy once upon a time  
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind  
For every copper penny and clover he would find  
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times  
For no more cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
His clothes were always clean  
His face was always scrubbed  
There was food on the table enough to fill him up  
His house was full of life - His house was full of love  
But when winter days arrived  
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed  
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs  
But with nobody to share the life he'd made  
No body to keep him warm at night  
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above  
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God  
When a woman passing by brushed his arm  
He turned and found love  
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger  
Who she was to not have cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things  
So he promised more than he could buy  
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He worked day and night his fingers to the bone  
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on  
He can't give her what she needs  
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants  
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man  
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land  
But some guys he knew from high school days  
Said they had a plan to get rich quick  
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms  
Dreamt about the life he'd buy  
The comfort that would come without cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around  
He said the little boy is dead  
A man stands with you now without cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
Without cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet  
  
He thought he'd set his clock right, He though he'd read his watch  
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck  
Makes no difference if you're early, No difference if you're late  
When you're out of time, The flowers have been laid  
You're six feet underground  
With cold feet  
Cold cold cold cold feet

I'm feeling sorry for myself  
It's quite a sight  
But I have you to thank  
For reminding me  
We're all alone in this world  
And in matters of the heart  
  
I'm already missing you  
Although we won't say good byes  
Until tomorrow afternoon  
Maybe when and if I see you again  
We'll see eye to eye

I have no harsh words for you  
I have no tears to cry  
If the moon were full  
I'd be howling inside  
It only hurts  
In matters of the heart

As bronte's bird a bird that could fly  
And all accounts would be settled

For one more time, when I can sing for you

And claim that those most worthy  
Will get what they deserve

We must hope those words are lies

Are never realized

And you drive a fancy car  
So what if your pockets are full  
If you have an empty heart  
  
You snap your fingers  
And all the waters part  
So what if the people bow down  
If they show you no regard  
  
Your left hand  
Always watches your right  
So what if you trust in god  
If you can't sleep at night  
  
You think you've made it  
You think you've got what everyone wants  
So what if you're a big fat man  
With an empty little heart

In my spaceship I am laughing  
In your remembrance of your bad dream  
There's no one but you standing  
  
Leave the pity and the blame  
For the ones who do not speak  
You write the words to get respect and compassion  
And for posterity  
You write the words and make believe

Give us one more sad sordid story

Not to mention a sexual healin'

So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them  
So much muscle that you never gotta flex them  
To catch you when you fall

Or that you don't shave your legs

Or that you're just like everybody else in the world  
You just got lucky, that's all  
  
And I know you're not here to amuse me

I got my feet on the ground and family above  
Can you send some happiness with my best

Was lifting me out of the sea  
And even when I'm sinking I feel the need

I admit it's not much fun  
To be led on by such a one  
As you are  
As you are  
As you are  
  
And ever since a long time  
I felt the rain  
And there was no danger  
And no more strangers

I would see him arrive at the door  
Pushed you aside as he staggered inside  
  
Spilling alcohol over the floor  
A storm is abrewin' and it's sure to fall soon  
As I look at you from the shore  
So  
  
You better hold on  
'Cause it's Saturday night  
And your friends are all out  
And you feel like shit  
  
'Cause they never call you  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
  
Never bloody ever  
Call me a name and I'll hit you again  
You're a slut, you're a bitch, you're a whore  
Talked to your daddy in that tone of voice  
  
There's a belt hanging over the door  
So you run to your room  
And you hide in your room  
Thinking how you could settle the score  
  
But  
Saturday night at a quarter to six  
And your friends are all out  
And you're live in the sticks  
  
Still they never call you  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
  
Never bloody ever call  
Blue flashing light last Saturday night  
Brought the neighbours all out on the street  
They watched as the firemen carried you out  
  
And they stared at each other's feet  
Now everyone sees and yet nobody says  
How we're all just afraid of the heat  
But  
  
It's Saturday night  
And I'm lying alone in the bed that I made  
Disconnected the phone  
Still they never call you  
  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
Never bloody ever call  
  
Never bloody ever  
Never  
Never do

All the paper lying on the ground  
Burning pages and those spinning heads  
Is something wrong  
In their lives?  
We need paradise  
Oohh, where you going wrong?  
  
Don't let your heart run out on me  
Don't set the horses free  
We never laid it on the line  
No time  
No warning sign  
  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?

Don't let your heart run out on me  
Don't set the horses free  
We never laid it on the line  
No time  
No warning sign

Many think they're brainy but they haven't a clue

We are wrong, we are wrong  
We are all so, so wrong  
We are monkeys  
We are false, we run true  
We should be in the zoo with our uncles  
And if you don't believe  
Go and climb up a tree and you'll love it  
You're a fool to believe anymore  
So believe you're a monkey  
  
All the clever monkeys telling us what to do  
Telling us to stay in line and join the monkey queue  
Thinking that they're special cause they went to private zoo  
One day soon they're gonna end up in a monkey stew

My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find  
I did not know it was such a violent island  
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.  
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin  
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win.  
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.

From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone.  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.

Twenty One Pilots,Ode To Sleep,/t/twenty+one+pilots/ode+to+sleep_21045449.html,"I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy,  
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,  
I go up to the ceiling,  
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding,  
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,  
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free,  
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,  
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,  
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.  
I'll stay awake, 'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.  
Why am I not scared in the morning, I don't hear those voices calling,  
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out,  
I swear I heard demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling,  
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.  
But I'll tell them,  
Why won't you let me go?  
Do I threaten all your plans, I'm insignificant,  
Please tell them you have no plans for me,  
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?  
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,  
As the trees they await and clouds anticipate,  
The start of a day when we put on our face,  
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,  
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,  
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,  
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,  
Desperately yelling there's something we need,  
I'm not free I asked forgiveness three times,  
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,  
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you what I'm sing towards,  
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.

Never in the mood - to change his life  
Nobody wants to help him - as he spirals down  
But one day the wrong decision - hit him overnight  
  
No more cocktail parties - champagne's run dry  
No company take-overs - stock markets high  
No more hand-jobs in the boardroom - sex is history  
And no saunas, no jacuzzis - the penalties you'll reap  
  
At last he realized - he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere - double-dealing lies  
  
He's going down on his bad luck - his just deserts  
He's going down on his bad luck - what he deserved  
  
His old man told him always - listen son  
It's a two-way street to fortune - you gotta hit and run  
Don't forget the mirror - look who's behind  
And don't you come up crying - when it's faster coming down  
  
At last he realized - he did it wrong  
Messed big time everywhere - double-dealing lies

Arms entwined, the chosen few  
The newspapers says, says  
Say it's true, it's true  
And we can break through  
Though torn in two  
We can be one  
  
I, I will begin again

And so we're told this is the golden age  
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage  
Though I want to be with you  
Be with you night and day  
Nothing changes  
On New Year's Day

Breaking on your back like a beach

Working all my life isn't good for my health

The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around  
Digging deep for clues on higher ground  
  
Moon and stars sit way up high  
Earth and trees beneath them lie  
The wind blows fragrant lullaby  
To cool the night for you and I  
On the wing the birds fly free  
Leviathan tames angry sea  
The flower waits for honeybee  
The sunrise wakes new life in me  
  
And every hour of every day I'm learning more  
The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around  
Digging deep for clues on higher ground  
  
The fishes swim while rivers run  
Through fields to feast my eyes upon  
Intoxicated drinking from  
The loving cup of burning sun  
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste  
Of whispered rain on weary face  
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace  
Another time another place  
  
And every hour of everyday I'm learning more  
The more I learn, the less I know about before  
The less I know, the more I want to look around

Cause this mc has got the nack  
I'm your body-popping shell shocking  
Girls hocking eye popping lick me all over like a lollipop  
I'm your juicy fruit  
Alright, alright, alright

I'm a good locking, girl hooking outstanding  
Mile chatting lyrical shock attack

Its a struggle in life when your skin is black  
The system is designed to hold you back

One love to my face then a stab in the back  
Seven points in snooker when you put down the black  
But I still thank God for the little I got

Wind you hips, shake your body  
Or clap you hands even stamp your feet  
Just like a bed that's just been spread  
You know I'm neat, neat, neat  
Just like a tap that's running hot  
Man can't you feel the heat  
Not just now but every minute every hour  
Everyday and every week  
  
I don't give a hoot for loot and shoot  
Or prostitutes in skin tight suits  
Standing on the corner  
They call their beat  
I'm not a pimp drug pusher  
Gambler or even thief  
To the teachers I will preach  
And to the teachers I will teach  
Cause I'm a hip hop lyrical robot  
That is why so unique  
Well police and thieves are playing  
The game of hide and seek  
When an informer gives information  
Then its called a leak  
I jail your a number ruled by governor  
Screws keep you under, want to see you blunder  
When they say ""Sit"" just take a seat  
And when they say ""food"" it's time to eat  
If a screw says ""Nigger"" I don't answer  
Yes sir, no sir three bags full sir  
Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler  
Me a growler, I'm no growler

Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on  
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land  
So when the right time comes for Babylon's destruction

She finds now joy amid the sleaze  
It's hard when you've been paid to please  
So she turns her thoughts to the pillow

Daylight comes she rests her head  
The beauty of an empty bed  
She dreams of happy days instead  
Of brooding on to-morrow  
  
She swapped her dreams of shining knights  
For pushers, bars and money fights  
For nameless faces in red light  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
Those black eyes don't hurt any more  
She's heard the jokes and jibes before  
She's felt the long arm of the law  
So she turns her head to the pillow

Taking drugs was not for fun  
It made her feel like going on  
But now she hurts when its all gone  
And she turns her head to the pillow  
She take a blade and breaks her skin  
Sweet life force flows from within  
The white clouds in her head grow dim  
And she turns her head to the pillow

Sunlight creeps across her head  
Pale beauty in a crimson bed  
No dreams of happy days ahead  
She'll have no more tomorrows

Ufo,Love Is Forever,/u/ufo/love+is+forever_20141839.html,"(instrumental intro)  
I don't want to settle down  
Stop my heart and turn around  
Rebel nature, just got to be free  
I'm in the right place, right place to be  
Washers, dryers, dealers, and souls  
Looking into the fire  
Flat caps, whippets, lovers, and wives  
Balanced out on the wire  
And she said  
Love is forever babe  
Love is a tool  
Servant for jesus  
A slave for a fool  
I look out through love's back door  
I escape but not any more  
Revelation help me see  
I'm in the wrong place, the wrong place to be  
Washers dryers dealers and souls  
Looking up to rise higher  
Flat caps whippets lovers and wives  
Balanced out on the wire  
And she said  
Love is forever babe  
Love is a tool  
Servant for jesus  
Slave for a fool  
Love is for worshipped  
Love is a test  
Love is a firebrand burnin'  
A hole in her breast

Ufo,Love To Love,/u/ufo/love+to+love_20141886.html,"Oh it's been too many times and I can't go back  
Night bars, guitars, rundown motels like shacks  
What it mounts up to I don't want it at all  
Lost you and I want you today  
  
Love to love to love you  
Misty green and blue  
Love to love to love you  
  
To be something, to be with you  
Don't say that you'll never know  
Love to love to love you  
  
Half the time it could seem funny  
The other half is just too sad  
This west bound moon's they rise and fall  
Lost you and I want you today  
  
To be something, to be near you  
I don't know where I'm going to  
I've tried and I need you to stay

This year I've been feeling kinda weary  
Oh,next year I may not come back at all  
Sometimes I hear the angels a singing  
Or I can hear my mothers call  
Give me a cadillac for a carriage  
And you'll hear my name  
Whispering through the trees  
You can call me Mr. Black  
You can call me Mr. Grey  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
And tonight I'm feeling kinda beautiful  
Tonight I'm feeling kinda warm  
And there's a touch of humour  
In everything I see  
Oh there's a touch of scorn  
Give me a Mercedes for my baggage  
And hear my name on the breeze  
You can all me Mr. Black  
You can all me Mr. Green  
Or you can call me simply,  
Call me Mr. Freeze  
If you please Mr. Freeze  
Solo  
Give me a cadillac for a carriage  
And you'll hear my name  
Whispering through the trees  
You can call me Mr. Black  
You can call me Mr. Grey

Ufo,On With The Action,/u/ufo/on+with+the+action_20141926.html,"Something going on at the corner of the block  
Its the kids down there  
They were starting to rock  
High black fever running everyplace  
When the Greek kid pulled a knife  
And pushed it in his face  
Some girl makes it with a lover in the door,  
As the ambulance pulls away,  
She cries out more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's all night long, all night long  
On with the action  
You need the fastest legs alive  
On with the action  
If you can't run you ain't survive  
On with the action  
Mamas boy and teachers pet,  
On with the action  
Its down our street, is it in yours yet  
  
All the kids stand laughing  
They never had such fun  
Then someone cuts a blind man who just can't make a run  
And the queen who's been standing behind the toilet door  
His parents don't like boyfriends, call him a whore  
But the ministers staring  
With his Bible in his hand  
Was this gods children, he didn't understand  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You run with all the rest  
You've kept on moving but never got the best  
And all our yesterdays go sailing out of view  
I know there's something left hope you can make it through  
Pack it up and go, pack it up and go,  
Leftover from the show, just pack it up and go  
You made the impact back in 1969  
But now move over friend I think you've had your time  
And all our yesterdays go sailing out of view  
I know there' something left, hope you can make it through  
Pack it up and go, pack it up and go, left over from the show just pack it up

And all our yesterdays go sailing know there's something left  
Hope you can make it through

3-d vision and a glance of heaven  
Picked up my six string began to play  
Just one touch and it started to say  
  
All your dreams will come true  
Lovely mansion with a pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
  
A thousand motels waiting to trash  
Tv dinners, well I love that bash  
And if you Eddie, just say hi  
This party's open so drop on by  
  
All your dreams will come true  
A sunny haven from the inland revenue  
Hot nights in Paris a chance to dance  
Since I signed up I've been living in a trance  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
  
I'm feeling sick like dawn of the dead  
I've got marines marching through my head  
John-boy Walton, he's so nice  
So come in this must be paradise

That lovely mansion with it's pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife

No bon voyage,

Like a twisted wreck  
Let's save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
From the high plains  
To the border  
All across the land  
From the flying of the flag  
To lovers kissing hands  
  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I don't know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
A street full of whispers,  
Rings like a chinese gong  
A room full of would be's  
Whose lives have gone wrong  
  
The blues don't exist now  
Just to cleanse your soul  
They were made to wake you up  
Not to dig a hole  
  
You can cover me in roses,  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes

It would make you weep  
When you kiss your love goodnight  
Now I see why lovers leap

Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes

Caught between wars  
Tells us something is coming

And kisses his ear

Running on fear  
And it goes around,

Their importance of choice  
And as they swung Mussolini  
Like a chime in the breeze  
The pope blessed his children  
In a sea of sleaze

To the general's own tune  
All the rich and the famous  
Don't know who I am  
The jokers and the jugglers
